    "historicalContext": "The Poincare Conjecture was posed in 1904 and remained open for nearly a century. Perelman proved it in 2002-2003 using Hamilton's Ricci flow, declining both the Fields Medal and the Millennium Prize.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Perelman):** Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere S^3.\n\nThis was the first Millennium Prize Problem to be solved.",
    "proofStrategy": "Perelman used Ricci flow with surgery: evolve the metric by the Ricci flow equation, perform surgery when singularities form, and show the manifold eventually becomes spherical or goes extinct.",
