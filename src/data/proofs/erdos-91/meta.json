Prove that for large $n$ there are at least two (and probably many) such $A$ which are non-similar.\n\n\n\nFor $n=3$ the equilateral triangle is the only such set. For $n=4$ the square or two equilateral triangles sharing an edge give two non-similar examples.\n\nFor $n=5$ the regular pentagon is the unique such set (which has two distinct distances). Erd\\H{o}s mysteriously remarks in \\cite{Er90} this was proved by 'a colleague'. (In \\cite{Er87b} this is described as 'a colleague from Zagreb (unfortunately I do not have his letter)'.) A published proof of this fact is provided by Kov\\'{a}cs \\cite{Ko24c}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er87b} Erd\\H{o}s says that there are at least two non-similar examples for $6\\leq n\\leq 9$.\n\nThe minimal possible number of distinct distances is the subject of [89].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er87b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some combinatorial and metric problems in geometry.
