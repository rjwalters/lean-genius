    "historicalContext": "**Optimal Point Configurations**\n\nThe Erdős distinct distances problem asks: what is the minimum number of distinct distances among n points in the plane? This companion problem asks: for configurations achieving this minimum, are they unique up to similarity?\n\n**Small Cases**:\n- n=3: The equilateral triangle is uniquely optimal (1 distance)\n- n=4: Two non-similar optima exist - the square and two equilateral triangles sharing an edge\n- n=5: The regular pentagon is uniquely optimal (2 distances) - proved by an unnamed 'colleague from Zagreb', with published proof by Kovács (2024)\n- n=6 to 9: At least two non-similar examples exist for each\n\n**The Mystery**: Erdős remarked cryptically that n=5 uniqueness was proved by 'a colleague from Zagreb' whose letter he lost! Kovács finally published a proof in 2024.\n\n**The Conjecture**: For large n, there should be many non-similar optimal configurations.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet A ⊂ ℝ² with |A| = n minimize the number of distinct distances among pairs of points. Prove that for large n, there exist at least two non-similar such sets A.\n\n**Erdős's Expectation**: He believed there should be 'many' such non-similar configurations, not just two.\n\n**Known Results**:\n- n=3: Unique (equilateral triangle)\n- n=4: Non-unique (square vs bowtie)\n- n=5: Unique (regular pentagon) - Kovács 2024\n- n=6-9: Non-unique\n- Large n: OPEN\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approaches**\n\n**For Small n**: Exhaustive analysis of configurations with few distinct distances. The n=5 proof requires showing no non-pentagon configuration achieves only 2 distances.\n\n**For Large n**: Would require understanding the structure of optimal configurations. Possible approaches:\n1. Lattice-based constructions giving multiple non-similar optima\n2. Perturbation arguments showing continuous families exist\n3. Algebraic geometry of distance equations\n\n**The Challenge**: We don't even know the exact minimum number of distinct distances for large n (the Guth-Katz bound n/log n is not tight), making uniqueness questions even harder.",
