Is it true that\\[\\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\\mathcal{F})=o(n^2)?\\]\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Brown, Erd\\H{o}s, and S\\'{o}s \\cite{BES73}. The answer is yes, proved by Ruzsa and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{RuSz78} (this is known as the Ruzsa-Szemer\\'{edi problem}).\n\nIn \\cite{Er75b} and \\cite{Er81} Erd\\H{o}s asks whether the same is true for the collection of all $3$-uniform hypergraph on $k$ vertices with $k-3$ $3$-edges. In \\cite{Er75b} he even asks whether, for such $\\mathcal{F}$,\\[\\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\\mathcal{F})\\asymp n r_{k-3}(n),\\]where $r_{k-3}(n)$ is the maximal size of a subset of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ that does not contain a non-trivial arithmetic progression of length $k-3$. He states that Ruzsa has proved the lower bound for $k=6,7,8$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BES73] Brown, W. G. and Erd\\H{o}s, P. and S\\'os, V. T., Some extremal problems on {$r$}-graphs.
