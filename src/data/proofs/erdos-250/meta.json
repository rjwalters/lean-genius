  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether the series Σ σ(n)/2^n, where σ(n) is the sum of divisors function, is irrational. This connects to deep questions about values of arithmetic functions at algebraic points.\n\nYuri Nesterenko resolved this affirmatively in 1996 as part of his groundbreaking work on modular functions and transcendence. His proof established that this series is not only irrational but actually transcendental.\n\nNesterenko's methods also led to the famous result that π, e^π, and Γ(1/4) are algebraically independent—one of the deepest results in transcendental number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem**: Is $\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{2^n}$ irrational, where $\\sigma(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d$ is the sum of divisors function?\n\n**Answer**: YES. The sum is transcendental (stronger than irrational).\n\n**Solver**: Yuri Nesterenko (1996)",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses Nesterenko's deep work on modular functions and algebraic independence. The key insight is that this series can be expressed in terms of Eisenstein series evaluated at algebraic points. Nesterenko's theorem on algebraic independence of values of quasi-modular forms then implies transcendence.\n\nWe axiomatize the main result since the proof requires analytic number theory machinery (modular forms, transcendence methods) beyond current Mathlib.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Sum of Divisors Function**: σ(n) counts all divisors of n with weight equal to the divisor value. For example, σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.",
      "**Rapid Convergence**: The series converges quickly because σ(n) ≤ n² while 2^n grows exponentially. The partial sums approach ≈3.31369...",
      "**Eisenstein Connection**: The series relates to the Ramanujan-Eisenstein series P(q) = 1 - 24Σ σ(n)q^n at q = 1/2.",
      "**Transcendence Over Irrationality**: Nesterenko proved the stronger result that the sum is transcendental—not equal to any root of a polynomial with integer coefficients."
