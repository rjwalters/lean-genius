    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #596 from [Er87] asks for a characterization of graph pairs (G₁, G₂) satisfying a finite/countable Ramsey-type dichotomy. Erdős and Hajnal originally conjectured no such pairs exist, but Nešetřil-Rödl and Erdős-Hajnal showed that (C₄, C₆) is a valid pair. The related Problem #595 asks specifically about (K₄, K₃).",
    "problemStatement": "For which pairs (G₁, G₂) is it true that (1) for every n, there exists a G₁-free graph H such that every n-coloring of H's edges contains a monochromatic G₂, and (2) every G₁-free graph H admits a countable edge coloring with no monochromatic G₂? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines GraphProperty, FiniteRamseyProperty, CountableColoringProperty, and HasDichotomy. The known pair (C₄, C₆) is proved to satisfy the dichotomy from axioms of Nešetřil-Rödl and Erdős-Hajnal. The main problem asks for a complete characterization.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The dichotomy combines a finite Ramsey property with a countable coloring property",
      "Erdős-Hajnal originally conjectured no pairs exist, but (C₄, C₆) is a counterexample",
      "C₄-free graphs are countable unions of trees (Erdős-Hajnal)",
      "The pair (K₄, K₃) is an important open case (Problem #595)",
      "Connected to structural Ramsey theory and graph decomposition"
