    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980, p.64) posed this problem about irrationality of series formed from rapidly growing integer sequences. Erdős (1988) proved the result for sequences satisfying aₙ₊₁ ≥ C·aₙ² (quadratic growth), but the general case with only lim inf aₙ^{1/2ⁿ} > 1 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "If a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ is a strictly increasing integer sequence with lim inf aₙ^{1/2ⁿ} > 1, is Σ 1/(aₙ · aₙ₊₁) irrational?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define GrowthCondition (lim inf aₙ^{1/2ⁿ} > 1) and erdosSeries (Σ 1/(aₙ·aₙ₊₁)). ErdosProblem1051 states universal irrationality. The solved rapid growth case is axiomatized. Convergence and positivity are stated, along with the related simple reciprocal series question.",
