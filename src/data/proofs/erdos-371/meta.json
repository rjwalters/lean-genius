    "historicalContext": "This problem was conjectured by Erdős and Pomerance in 1978. They proved that both the set {n : P(n) < P(n+1)} and its complement have positive upper density, but couldn't establish the exact density. The problem attracted significant attention from analytic number theorists.\n\nTeräväinen (2018) proved that the logarithmic density is exactly 1/2. Tao and Teräväinen (2019) showed the asymptotic density is 1/2 at 'almost all scales'. Finally, Wang (2021) proved the full result (natural density = 1/2) conditionally on the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture for friable integers.\n\nThe best unconditional lower bound is due to Lü and Wang (2025), who proved that both sets have density at least 0.2017. The sequence of n with P(n) < P(n+1) is A070089 in OEIS.",
    "problemStatement": "Let P(n) denote the largest prime factor of n. Show that the set {n : P(n) < P(n+1)} has natural density 1/2.\n\n**Status**: Conditionally SOLVED (Wang 2021 under Elliott-Halberstam); Logarithmically SOLVED (Teräväinen 2018)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the greatest prime factor function P(n), various notions of density (natural, logarithmic, at almost all scales), and the main sets. The key results are axiomatized: Erdős-Pomerance positive upper density, Teräväinen logarithmic density 1/2, Tao-Teräväinen almost all scales, and Wang's conditional full result. We also formalize the generalized problem with parameter α and its connection to the Dickman function.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Natural density 1/2**: Intuitively, P(n) < P(n+1) should happen about half the time by symmetry",
      "**Logarithmic density**: Teräväinen proved the logarithmic density (weighting by 1/n) is exactly 1/2",
      "**Elliott-Halberstam**: Wang's full result requires this deep conjecture about prime distribution",
      "**Dickman function**: The generalized density formula involves the Dickman function ρ from smooth number theory",
      "**OEIS A070089**: The sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... shows even numbers often appear",
      "**Related #372, #928**: Connected to questions about P(n)/P(n+1) and consecutive prime factors"

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #371 on the density of consecutive integers with increasing largest prime factor. The logarithmic density was proved to be 1/2 by Teräväinen (2018), and the natural density is 1/2 conditionally on the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture (Wang 2021). The unconditional natural density remains open but is known to be at least 0.2017.",
    "implications": "This problem connects the distribution of prime factors with density theory. The appearance of the Dickman function in the generalized formula links this problem to smooth number theory. The conditional proof via Elliott-Halberstam demonstrates deep connections between prime distribution conjectures and multiplicative function theory.",
