Show that the set of $n$ with $P(n)<P(n+1)$ has density $1/2$.\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and Pomerance \\cite{ErPo78}, who proved that this set and its complement both have positive upper density. The best unconditional lower bound available is due to L\\\"{u} and Wang \\cite{LuWa25}, who prove that\\[\\#\\{ n<x :P(n)<P(n+1)\\} > (0.2017-o(1))x,\\]and the same lower bound for the complement.\n\nIn \\cite{Er79e} Erd\\H{o}s also asks whether, for every $\\alpha$, the density of the set of $n$ where\\[P(n+1)>P(n)n^\\alpha\\]exists.\n\nTer\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{Te18} has proved that the logarithmic density of the set of $n$ for which $P(n)<P(n+1)$ is $1/2$. Tao and Ter\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{TaTe19} have proved that the asymptotic density is $1/2$ at 'almost all scales'.\n\nMore generally, for any $0\\leq \\alpha \\leq1$, Ter\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{Te18} proved that the logarithmic density of the set of $n$ for which $P(n+1)>P(n)n^\\alpha$ exists and is equal to\\[\\int_{[0,1]^2}1_{y\\geq x+\\alpha}u(x)u(y)\\mathrm{d}x\\mathrm{d}y\\]where $u(x)=x^{-1}\\rho(x^{-1}-1)$ and $\\rho$ is the Dickman function. Wang \\cite{Wa21} has proved the same value holds for the asymptotic density (and in particular provided an affirmative answer to the original question) conditional on the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture for friable integers.\n\nThe sequence of such $n$ is A070089 in the OEIS.\n\nSee also [372] and [928].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er79e] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some unconventional problems in number theory.
