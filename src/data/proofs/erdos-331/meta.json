It is easy to see $A$ and $B$ both grow like $\\gg N^{1/2}$ and yet for any $n\\geq 1$ there is exactly one solution to $n=a+b$ with $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$.\n\nRuzsa suggests that a non-trivial variant of this problem arises if one imposes the stronger condition that\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\sim c_AN^{1/2}\\]for some constant $c_A>0$ as $N\\to \\infty$, and similarly for $B$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
