    "historicalContext": "**Fractional Part Distribution**\n\nThe fractional part function {x} = x - ⌊x⌋ plays a central role in Diophantine approximation. For irrational α, the sequence {α}, {2α}, {3α}, ... is equidistributed in [0,1) by Weyl's theorem.\n\n**The Weighted Sum**: Erdős considered the deviation from uniformity: f(α,n) = (1/log n) Σ (1/2 - {αk}). The factor 1/2 centers the fractional part, and dividing by log n normalizes the sum.\n\n**Distribution Question**: Rather than asking about specific α, Erdős asked whether f(α,n) has an *asymptotic distribution* - does the measure of {α : f(α,n) ≤ c} converge as n → ∞?\n\n**Kesten's Breakthrough**: In 1960, Kesten proved the two-parameter variant f(α,β,n) = (1/log n) Σ (1/2 - {β + αk}) has asymptotic Cauchy distribution. Averaging over β provides independence that the one-parameter case lacks.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nFor any 0 < α < 1, define:\n$$f(\\alpha,n) = \\frac{1}{\\log n} \\sum_{1 \\leq k \\leq n} \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\{\\alpha k\\}\\right)$$\n\nDoes f(α,n) possess an asymptotic distribution function?\n\nMore precisely: Does there exist a non-decreasing function g with g(-∞) = 0, g(+∞) = 1, such that:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} |\\{\\alpha \\in (0,1) : f(\\alpha,n) \\leq c\\}| = g(c)?$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Related Result**: Kesten (1960) proved that f(α,β,n) with an additional shift parameter β has Cauchy distribution g(c) = (1/π)arctan(ρc) + 1/2.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Why This Problem is Difficult**\n\nThe key difficulty is the loss of independence when β = 0:\n\n1. **Two-Parameter Case**: Averaging over both α and β provides sufficient independence for ergodic methods.\n\n2. **One-Parameter Case**: With β = 0 fixed, the sequence {αk} for different k values has subtle correlations.\n\n3. **Continued Fractions**: The behavior of f(α,n) depends on the continued fraction expansion of α. Different Diophantine properties of α lead to different behaviors.\n\n4. **Dynamical Systems**: The problem connects to geodesic flows on modular surfaces, but the relevant ergodic theory is incomplete.\n\n**Potential Approaches**:\n- Study the joint distribution of (α, {α}, {2α}, ..., {nα})\n- Analyze the Fourier transform of the distribution\n- Use number-theoretic properties of continued fractions",
