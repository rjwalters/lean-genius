  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects to a classical result by Sylvester (1892) and Schur (1929) showing that among any k consecutive integers greater than k, at least one has a prime factor greater than k. Erdős published this as Problem #961, asking for better bounds on f(k).\n\nErdős himself improved the bound in 1955 to f(k) < 3k/log(k), showing sublinear growth. The strongest known result came from Jutila (1974) and independently Ramachandra-Shorey (1973), who proved f(k) ≪ (log log log k / log log k) · (k/log k) using sieve methods.\n\nThe problem is essentially equivalent to Problem #683, which asks about gaps between smooth numbers. The conjecture that f(k) grows only polylogarithmically remains wide open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(k)$ be the minimal $n$ such that every set of $n$ consecutive integers greater than $k$ contains an integer divisible by a prime greater than $k$ (equivalently, not $(k+1)$-smooth).\n\n**Known bounds:**\n- $f(k) \\leq k$ (Sylvester-Schur 1934)\n- $f(k) < 3k/\\log k$ (Erdős 1955)\n- $f(k) \\ll \\frac{\\log\\log\\log k}{\\log\\log k} \\cdot \\frac{k}{\\log k}$ (Jutila, Ramachandra-Shorey 1973-74)\n\n**Conjecture:** $f(k) \\ll (\\log k)^{O(1)}$",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize smooth numbers using Mathlib's Nat.smoothNumbers, defining k-smooth integers as those with all prime factors ≤ k. The function f(k) is defined as the minimal n satisfying the key property.\n\nThe Sylvester-Schur bound f(k) ≤ k follows directly from the classical theorem. Stronger bounds from Erdős and Jutila-Ramachandra-Shorey are stated as axioms since they require deep analytic number theory (sieve methods, prime distribution).\n\nThe polylogarithmic conjecture is formalized but marked as open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Smooth numbers**: A positive integer n is k-smooth if all its prime factors are ≤ k. Examples: 12 = 2²·3 is 3-smooth; 30 = 2·3·5 is 5-smooth but not 3-smooth",
      "**Sylvester-Schur**: The foundational result f(k) ≤ k uses pigeonhole: among k consecutive integers > k, one must have a large prime factor",
      "**Exponential gap**: Known bounds give f(k) = O(k/log²k · polylog), but the conjecture predicts f(k) = O(polylog k) - an exponential improvement",
      "**Connection to #683**: If g(k) is the largest gap between k-smooth numbers, then f(k) ≤ g(k) + 1"
