  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Burr, Erdős, Graham, and Li (1996) posed this question about digit-restricted sets. Melfi (2001) proved the counting function grows as x^{0.965}. Hasler and Melfi (2024) improved this to x^{0.9777} and showed the upper density is at most 0.696. The question of positive lower density remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A = {n ∈ ℕ : digits of n in base 3 are all 0 or 1} and B = {n ∈ ℕ : digits in base 4 are all 0 or 1}. Does A + B have positive lower density?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define digitSet b (numbers with only 0,1 digits in base b), setA = digitSet 3, setB = digitSet 4, and setC = A + B. ErdosProblem125 asks if lim inf |C ∩ [1,x]|/x > 0. Melfi's and Hasler–Melfi's bounds are axiomatized. The generalization to multiple bases and the log-sum condition are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A and B are 'Cantor set integers' — sparse but structured subsets of ℕ",
      "The counting function |C ∩ [1,x]| grows nearly linearly (exponent > 0.977)",
      "Upper density ≤ 0.696 shows C cannot be all of ℕ even if dense",
      "The condition log₃(2) + log₄(2) > 1 governs the generalization"
