  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects to the classical study of irrationality proofs. A sequence (a_n) is an 'irrationality sequence' if for every perturbation (b_n) with b_n/a_n → 1, the sum Σ 1/b_n is irrational. The folklore condition a_n^{1/2^n} → ∞ is sufficient. Kovač and Tao (2024) proved sequences with a_{n+1}/a_n² → 0 are NOT irrationality sequences.",
    "problemStatement": "A sequence (a_n) of positive integers is an irrationality sequence if for every (b_n) with b_n/a_n → 1, the sum Σ 1/b_n is irrational. (1) Is 2^{2^n} an irrationality sequence? (2) Must every irrationality sequence satisfy a_n^{1/n} → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the definition of irrationality sequences, the double exponential 2^{2^n}, various growth conditions (superexponential, folklore), the Kovač-Tao negative result, and positive sufficient conditions. We also formalize the non-computability of this property.",
