  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Le Veque posed this problem in 1953, proving special cases. Davenport-LeVeque (1963) showed it holds when gaps are monotonic, and Davenport-Erdős (1963) proved it for sequences with aₙ >> n^{1/2+ε}. Schmidt (1969) finally disproved the general conjecture by constructing a counterexample with oscillating gaps.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A = {a₁ < a₂ < ...} ⊆ ℕ be infinite with aᵢ₊₁/aᵢ → 1. Define f(x) = (x - aᵢ)/(aᵢ₊₁ - aᵢ) for x ∈ [aᵢ, aᵢ₊₁). Is f(αn) uniformly distributed in [0,1) for almost all α?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define unity ratio sequences, the generalized fractional part function, and uniform distribution. We state Schmidt's counterexample as an axiom, along with positive results by Davenport-LeVeque (monotonic gaps) and Davenport-Erdős (polynomial growth). The natural numbers case follows from Weyl's theorem.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For A = ℕ, f(x) = {x} is the usual fractional part, and Weyl's theorem applies",
      "The conjecture is TRUE when gaps aₙ₊₁ - aₙ are monotonically increasing",
      "The conjecture is TRUE when aₙ >> n^{1/2+ε} (polynomial growth)",
      "Schmidt's counterexample has carefully controlled oscillating gaps",
      "The key obstruction is rapid oscillation in gap sizes while maintaining aᵢ₊₁/aᵢ → 1"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #492 asked whether a generalized fractional part function f(αn) is uniformly distributed for almost all α. Schmidt (1969) disproved the general conjecture, but it holds under additional conditions: monotonic gaps (Davenport-LeVeque) or polynomial growth aₙ >> n^{1/2+ε} (Davenport-Erdős).",
    "implications": "The problem reveals the subtle interplay between sequence structure and equidistribution. Gap oscillations can destroy uniform distribution even when consecutive ratios approach 1. This connects to Diophantine approximation and measure-theoretic dynamics.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact characterization of sequences for which the conjecture holds?",
      "Can the polynomial growth exponent 1/2+ε be improved?",
      "What measure-theoretic properties characterize the exceptional set?"
