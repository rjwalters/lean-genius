  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "First investigated by Rényi and Rédei (1947). Erdős (1949) proved an upper bound f(k) < k^(1-c). The conjecture f(k) → ∞ was due to Erdős and Rényi. Schinzel (1987) proved f(k) > (log log k)/log 2. Schinzel-Zannier (2009) improved this to f(k) ≫ log k. Listed as Problem 4.4 in Hayman (1974).",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(k) be the minimum number of terms in P(x)², where P ∈ ℚ[x] ranges over all polynomials with exactly k non-zero terms. Is it true that f(k) → ∞ as k → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define termCount for polynomials using Polynomial.support.card, then define f(k) as the infimum over all k-term polynomials. The main results state bounds: Erdős upper bound f(k) < k^(1-c), Schinzel lower bound f(k) > (log log k)/log 2, and Schinzel-Zannier improvement f(k) ≫ log k.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Squaring a polynomial can reduce terms through cancellation of cross-terms",
      "However, this reduction cannot continue indefinitely as k grows",
      "Schinzel's proof extends to P(x)^n for any n ≥ 1",
      "The result holds over any field of characteristic 0 or sufficiently large"
