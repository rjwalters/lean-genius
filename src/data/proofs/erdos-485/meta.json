Is it true that $f(k)\\to\\infty$ as $k\\to \\infty$?\n\n\n\nThis is Problem 4.4 in \\cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nFirst investigated by R\\'{e}nyi and R\\'{e}dei \\cite{Re47}. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er49b} proved that $f(k)<k^{1-c}$ for some $c>0$. The conjecture that $f(k)\\to \\infty$ is due to Erd\\H{o}s and R\\'{e}nyi.\n\nThis was solved by Schinzel \\cite{Sc87}, who proved that\\[f(k) > \\frac{\\log\\log k}{\\log 2}.\\]In fact Schinzel proves lower bounds for the corresponding problem with $P(x)^n$ for any integer $n\\geq 1$, where the coefficients of the polynomial can be from any field with zero or sufficiently large positive characteristic.\n\nSchinzel and Zannier \\cite{ScZa09} have improved this to\\[f(k) \\gg \\log k.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er49b] Erd\\\"{o}s, P., On the number of terms of the square of a polynomial.
