Is there a graph of infinite chromatic number such that every finite subgraph on $n$ vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most $f(n)$ edges?\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{EHS82}.\n\nR\\\"{o}dl \\cite{Ro82} has proved this for hypergraphs, and also proved there is such a graph (with chromatic number $\\aleph_0$) if $f(n)=\\epsilon n$ for any fixed constant $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nIt is open even for $f(n)=\\sqrt{n}$. Erd\\H{o}s offered \\$500 for a proof but only \\$250 for a counterexample. This fails (even with $f(n)\\gg n$) if the graph has chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ (see [111]).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHS82] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A. and Szemer\\'{e}di, E., On almost bipartite large chromatic graphs.
