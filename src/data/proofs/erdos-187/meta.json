  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Cohen originally posed the question of finding the optimal f(d) for monochromatic arithmetic progressions in 2-colorings. Erdős studied the problem extensively, observing that coloring based on {√2·n} < 1/2 gives f(d) ≪ d. Beck (1980) improved this to f(d) ≤ (1+o(1))log₂ d using a probabilistic construction. Van der Waerden's theorem ensures f(d) → ∞.",
    "problemStatement": "Find the optimal function f(d) such that in any 2-coloring of ℤ, at least one color class contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length f(d) with common difference d, for infinitely many d.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define 2-colorings, monochromatic APs, and the optimal bound function axiomatically. Known bounds from van der Waerden, Beck, and Erdős's construction are recorded as axioms. The open question is formalized as a Θ(log d) characterization.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Van der Waerden's theorem guarantees f(d) → ∞",
      "Beck's construction gives f(d) ≤ (1+o(1))log₂ d, the best known upper bound",
      "Erdős's √2-coloring shows some colorings have f(d) ≪ d",
      "The gap between log d (upper) and the lack of a matching lower bound is the core difficulty",
      "The problem connects Ramsey theory to Diophantine approximation via the √2-coloring"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #187 asks for the exact asymptotic behavior of f(d), the optimal monochromatic AP length in 2-colorings with common difference d. Beck's bound gives f(d) = O(log d), but a matching lower bound is missing.",
    "implications": "Resolution would bridge Ramsey theory and Diophantine approximation, clarifying how well-structured colorings can avoid long monochromatic APs.",
