  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns discrepancy theory - measuring how far a sequence deviates from uniform distribution. Erdős asked in the early 1960s whether every sequence in [0,1] must have unbounded discrepancy for some interval. Schmidt (1968) proved YES, and strengthened it (1972) to uncountably many intervals. Tijdeman-Wagner (1980) showed the optimal logarithmic bound.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED: YES)**\n\nLet z₁, z₂, ... ∈ [0,1] be an infinite sequence. Define discrepancy:\n  D_N(I) = #{n ≤ N : zₙ ∈ I} - N·|I|\n\n**Question:** Must there exist some interval I ⊆ [0,1] such that\n  limsup |D_N(I)| = ∞?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Schmidt 1968)\n\n**Optimal:** Discrepancy ≫ log N for almost all intervals (Tijdeman-Wagner 1980)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines discrepancy and the main question. Schmidt's theorem is axiomatized as the affirmative answer. We also formalize the strengthening (uncountably many intervals), Tijdeman-Wagner's logarithmic bound, and van der Corput's matching upper bound showing optimality.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #255 is SOLVED with answer YES. For any sequence in [0,1], some interval must have unbounded discrepancy (Schmidt 1968). This holds for uncountably many intervals (Schmidt 1972), with discrepancy ≫ log N for almost all (Tijdeman-Wagner 1980). The logarithmic bound is optimal.",
    "implications": "This result is fundamental in discrepancy theory with applications to quasi-Monte Carlo integration, numerical analysis, and computational number theory. It shows that no sequence can be 'too uniformly distributed' - irregularities must occur.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What are the precise constants in the logarithmic bounds?",
      "How do multi-dimensional generalizations behave?",
      "What is the discrepancy for specific number-theoretic sequences?"
