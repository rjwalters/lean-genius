    "content": "For K₄-free graphs, the triangle-free subset result holds for all δ > 0. This shows the conjecture is plausible: excluding a smaller clique makes it easier to find triangle-free subsets.",
    "significance": "The K₄ case confirms the general philosophy. The jump from K₄ to K₅ is where the difficulty lies."

    "content": "For every δ > 0, any K₅-free graph on n vertices with ≥ δn² edges contains a triangle-free subset of size ≥ c(δ)·n for some constant c(δ) > 0. This extends the EHSSS result from δ > 1/16 to all positive δ.",
    "significance": "This is one of the key open problems in extremal graph theory, testing whether Ramsey-type phenomena persist for K₅-free graphs at all densities."
