    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #990** concerns the angular distribution of polynomial roots, a fundamental topic connecting complex analysis, number theory, and probability.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős-Turán (1950):** Proved that polynomial roots cannot cluster too much in any angular sector. The discrepancy is O(√(d log M)) where d is the degree.\n- **Ganelius (1954):** Improved the constant in the Erdős-Turán bound.\n- **Mignotte (1992):** Further refinements of the constant.\n- **Soundararajan (2019):** Connected the problem to Hilbert transforms and Fourier analysis.\n- **Steinerberger et al. (2021):** Proved the sharp Erdős-Turán inequality, determining the optimal constant.\n\n**The Open Question:** Can the bound be improved for sparse polynomials by replacing the degree d with the number of nonzero coefficients n? For x^d - 1, we have n = 2 but d can be arbitrarily large.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet $f = a_0 + a_1 x + \\cdots + a_d x^d \\in \\mathbb{C}[x]$ be a polynomial with roots $z_1, \\ldots, z_d$ having arguments $\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_d \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that for all intervals $I \\subseteq [0, 2\\pi]$:\n$$\\left| \\#\\{\\theta_i \\in I\\} - \\frac{|I|}{2\\pi} d \\right| \\ll \\sqrt{n \\log M}$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the number of nonzero coefficients and\n$$M = \\frac{|a_0| + \\cdots + |a_d|}{\\sqrt{|a_0||a_d|}}$$\n\n**Known Result (Erdős-Turán 1950):** This holds with $n$ replaced by $d$ (the degree).\n\n**Status:** OPEN for the sparse case. The classical result with degree $d$ is PROVED.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** ComplexPoly, nonzeroCoeffCount (sparsity), mahlerM (normalization)\n\n2. **Root Counting:** rootsInInterval, expectedCount, discrepancy, maxDiscrepancy\n\n3. **Classical Result:** Axiomatize Erdős-Turán (1950) with degree d\n\n4. **Sparse Conjecture:** Define as replacing d with n (sparsity)\n\n5. **Supporting Results:** Ganelius improvement, sharp constant, Erdélyi one-sided version\n\n6. **Special Cases:** Roots of unity, Littlewood polynomials",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #990 asks whether polynomial root distribution can be controlled by sparsity rather than degree. The classical Erdős-Turán inequality (1950) bounds discrepancy by O(√(d log M)) where d is degree. The question whether d can be replaced by n (number of nonzero coefficients) remains OPEN. The sharp constant in the classical inequality was determined in 2021.",
