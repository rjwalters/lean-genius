  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős described this as 'perhaps my favourite problem.' He conjectured the answer would be YES (minimum modulus can be arbitrarily large), but was proven wrong. Hough (2015) showed the answer is NO with bound 10^16. Balister et al. (2022) improved this to 616,000 with a simpler proof. Owens (2014) constructed a covering system with minimum modulus 42.",
    "problemStatement": "Can the smallest modulus of a covering system be arbitrarily large? A covering system is a finite collection of arithmetic progressions {a₁ mod n₁, ..., aₖ mod nₖ} with distinct moduli ≥ 2 that cover all integers.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines congruence classes, covering systems, and minimum modulus. The original (disproved) conjecture and the solution are stated. Key results are axiomatized: Hough's bound (10^16), Balister et al.'s bound (616,000), and Owens' construction (min modulus 42). The density argument via reciprocal sums is sketched.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #2, a SOLVED problem asking whether the minimum modulus of a covering system can be arbitrarily large. The answer is NO: every covering system has a modulus at most 616,000 (Balister et al.), while constructions exist with minimum modulus 42 (Owens).",
    "implications": "This resolves one of Erdős' favorite problems, contrary to his expectation. The exact maximum possible minimum modulus remains unknown, lying between 42 and 616,000. The result connects to density arguments: the sum of reciprocals of distinct moduli starting from m grows slowly, constraining m.",
