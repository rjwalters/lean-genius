  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about the structure of maximal Sidon sets. A Sidon set has all pairwise sums distinct. The question asks whether maximal Sidon sets always leave room for other Sidon sets with completely disjoint non-zero differences. Sedov proved the cases M = 2 and M = 3.",
    "problemStatement": "For every M ≥ 1 and N sufficiently large, is it true that every maximal Sidon set A ⊆ {1,...,N} admits a companion Sidon set B ⊆ {1,...,N} of size M with (A−A) ∩ (B−B) = {0}?",
    "proofStrategy": "Full rewrite from formal-conjectures. We define Sidon sets, maximality in {1,...,N}, difference sets, and disjoint-difference properties. Sedov's results for M ≤ 3 are axiomatized. The general conjecture and its constructive version are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A Sidon set in {1,...,N} has at most ~√N elements",
      "Maximality means no element can be added while preserving the Sidon property",
      "Disjoint differences (A−A) ∩ (B−B) = {0} is a strong structural constraint",
      "Sedov's computational methods handle M ≤ 3 but the general case requires new ideas"
