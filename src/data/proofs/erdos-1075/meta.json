There exists $c_r>r^{-r}$ such that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, the following holds.\n\nAny $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with at least $(1+\\epsilon)(n/r)^r$ many edges contains a subgraph on $m$ vertices with at least $c_rm^r$ edges, where $m=m(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64f} proved that this is true with $c_r=r^{-r}$ whenever the graph has at least $\\epsilon n^r$ many edges.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er64f] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On extremal problems of graphs and generalized graphs.
