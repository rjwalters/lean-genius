    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1075: Dense Subgraphs in Hypergraphs**\n\nThis problem appears in Erdős [Er74c, p.80] and concerns extremal hypergraph theory.\n\n**Key History:**\n- **Erdős [Er64f] (1964):** Proved that with edge threshold εn^r, one can find m-vertex subgraphs with density c_r = r^{-r}·m^r\n- **Erdős [Er74c] (1974):** Asked whether c_r > r^{-r} works with the weaker threshold (1+ε)(n/r)^r\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nThe constant r^{-r} is what random selection gives. Beating it requires exploiting structure from the edge density assumption. The weaker threshold (1+ε)(n/r)^r vs εn^r might enable this improvement.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet r ≥ 3. Does there exist c_r > r^{-r} such that for any ε > 0, if n is sufficiently large:\n\nAny r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with at least (1+ε)(n/r)^r edges contains a subgraph on m vertices with at least c_r·m^r edges, where m = m(n) → ∞ as n → ∞.\n\n**What's Known:**\n- Erdős [Er64f] proved this for c_r = r^{-r} with threshold εn^r\n- No improvement beyond r^{-r} is currently known\n\n**Key Point:** The edge threshold (1+ε)(n/r)^r is much smaller than εn^r, so the hypothesis is weaker. Can this lead to stronger conclusions?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Hypergraph Structure:** Define r-uniform hypergraphs with uniformity constraint on edge cardinality\n\n2. **Induced Subhypergraph:** Hypergraph.induced restricts to edges fully contained in a vertex subset\n\n3. **Threshold Constant:** thresholdConstant(r) = r^{-r}, the bound from random selection\n\n4. **Known Result:** erdos_1964_result axiomatizes Erdős's 1964 theorem\n\n5. **Open Conjecture:** ErdosConjecture1075 asks for c_r > r^{-r}\n\n6. **Approaches:** Document regularity lemma, probabilistic, and algebraic potential methods",
