    "historicalContext": "**Ramsey Theory Background**\n\nBy Ramsey's theorem, every graph on n vertices contains a trivial (empty or complete) subgraph on ≫ log n vertices. Graphs avoiding large trivial subgraphs are called 'non-Ramsey'.\n\n**The Question**: Erdős, Fajtlowicz, and Staton asked whether non-Ramsey graphs must contain large induced non-trivial regular subgraphs.\n\n**Resolution**: Prömel and Rödl (1999) proved something much stronger: non-Ramsey graphs are 'c log n - universal' - they contain ALL graphs on O(log n) vertices as induced subgraphs.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIf G is a graph on n vertices with no trivial (empty or complete) subgraph on ≥ 10 log n vertices, must G contain an induced non-trivial regular subgraph on ≫ log n vertices?\n\n**Status**: SOLVED\n\n**Answer**: YES (Prömel-Rödl 1999)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach**\n\n1. **Universality**: Prömel-Rödl prove that non-Ramsey graphs are c log n - universal.\n\n2. **Regular Subgraphs Exist**: Since universal graphs contain all small graphs, they contain k-regular graphs for appropriate k.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: Avoiding trivial subgraphs forces such rich structure that the graph contains everything of moderate size.\n\n4. **From Universality to Regular**: Pick any non-trivial regular graph H on O(log n) vertices; it appears as an induced subgraph.",
