Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er93} writes 'Perhaps very much more is true but we could not even prove this seemingly weak result'.\n\nBy Ramsey's theorem every graph on $n$ vertices contains a trivial subgraph on $\\gg \\log n$ many vertices.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Pr\\\"{o}mel and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{PrRo99}, in the strong sense that, for any $c>0$, if $G$ contains no trivial subgraph on $\\geq c\\log n$ vertices then $G$ contains all graphs with $O_c(\\log n)$ many vertices as induced subgraphs.\n\nSee also [82] for how large an induced regular subgraph a general graph must contain.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er93] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some of my favorite solved and unsolved problems in graph\ntheory.
