  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #724: Mutually Orthogonal Latin Squares**\n\nThis problem concerns the growth rate of f(n), the maximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order n. Latin squares have been studied since Euler's time, and MOLS have deep connections to finite geometry, coding theory, and experimental design.\n\n**Historical Milestones:**\n- **Euler (1782)**: Conjectured f(n) = 1 for n ≡ 2 (mod 4), meaning no two orthogonal Latin squares exist for these orders\n- **Bose, Parker, Shrikhande (1960)**: Disproved Euler's conjecture by showing f(n) ≥ 2 for all n ≥ 7\n- **Chowla, Erdős, Straus (1960)**: Proved f(n) ≫ n^(1/91), establishing the first polynomial lower bound\n- **Wilson (1974)**: Improved to f(n) ≫ n^(1/17)\n- **Beth (1983)**: Current best bound f(n) ≫ n^(1/14.8)\n\n**Mathematical Significance:**\nMOLS are equivalent to several important structures: affine planes, projective planes, transversal designs, and certain error-correcting codes. The maximum f(n) = n - 1 is achieved exactly when n is a prime power, corresponding to the existence of a projective plane of order n.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $f(n)$ denote the maximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. Is it true that\n$$f(n) \\gg n^{1/2}?$$\n\nIn other words, does there exist a constant $C > 0$ such that $f(n) \\geq C \\cdot n^{1/2}$ for all sufficiently large $n$?\n\n**Status: OPEN**\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Upper bound: $f(n) \\leq n - 1$ (classical, tight for prime powers)\n- Lower bound: $f(n) \\gg n^{1/14.8}$ (Beth, 1983)\n\nThe gap between the conjectured exponent 1/2 ≈ 0.5 and the best known 1/14.8 ≈ 0.068 is substantial.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\nSince this is an open problem, we formalize:\n\n1. **Definitions:** Latin squares via row/column bijections, orthogonality via pair bijection, and the MOLS function f(n) as a supremum\n\n2. **Known Results:** Axiomatize the upper bound (f(n) ≤ n-1), prime power equality (f(p^k) = p^k-1), and the Bose-Parker-Shrikhande theorem (f(n) ≥ 2 for n ≥ 7)\n\n3. **Progress:** Axiomatize the sequence of lower bound improvements by Chowla-Erdős-Straus, Wilson, and Beth\n\n4. **Conjecture:** State Erdős's conjecture as a Prop definition\n\n5. **Examples:** Provide concrete MOLS constructions for small orders\n\n6. **Connections:** Include the relationship to projective planes",
