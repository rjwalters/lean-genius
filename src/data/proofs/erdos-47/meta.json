    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #47 asks whether dense subsets of {1, …, N} (measured by reciprocal sum) must contain a subset whose reciprocals sum to 1. Bloom [Bl21] proved this affirmatively; Liu and Sawhney [LiSa24] improved the quantitative threshold. Pomerance showed Erdős's conjectured (log log N)² bound is essentially optimal.",
    "problemStatement": "If δ > 0 and N is large, and A ⊆ {1, …, N} has ∑ 1/a > δ log N, must there exist S ⊆ A with ∑ 1/n = 1? SOLVED: YES (Bloom).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the unit fraction problem using Finset and ℚ arithmetic. Bloom's theorem and the Liu–Sawhney improvement are stated as axioms. Pomerance's lower bound construction is also axiomatized.",
