Is it true that $G$ has at most $n^2/4$ edges?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Murty and Plesnik (see \\cite{CaHa79}) (although F\\\"{u}redi credits this conjecture to Murty and Simon, and further mentions that Erd\\H{o}s told him that the conjecture goes back to Ore in the 1960s). The complete bipartite graph shows that this would be best possible.\n\nThis is true (for sufficiently large $n$) and was proved by F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{Fu92}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CaHa79] Caccetta, Louis and H\\\"{a}ggkvist, Roland, On diameter critical graphs.
