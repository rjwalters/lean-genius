  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős introduced the concept of 'barriers' for arithmetic functions. A number n is a barrier for f if m + f(m) ≤ n for all m < n. He observed that functions like φ and σ grow too fast to have barriers beyond trivial cases. For ω (number of distinct prime divisors), he conjectured infinitely many barriers exist. In [Er79d], he proved that the exponent product function F(n) = ∏kᵢ has barriers with positive density. Selfridge computed that 99840 is the largest Ω-barrier below 10^5.",
    "problemStatement": "Let ω(n) denote the number of distinct primes dividing n. A number n is a barrier for ω if m + ω(m) ≤ n for all m < n. Are there infinitely many such barriers? Additionally, is there ε > 0 such that infinitely many n satisfy m + ε·ω(m) ≤ n for all m < n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines barriers for general arithmetic functions, specializes to ω and Ω, proves basic properties, and states the main conjectures. We include Erdős's result on expProd, Selfridge's computation, and connections to iterated dynamics.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #413 asks whether ω has infinitely many barriers. A barrier n blocks all trajectories m + ω(m) from below. Erdős proved related results for expProd and conjectured ω behaves similarly. The ε-variant asks about weaker barrier conditions.",
    "implications": "Resolution would illuminate the structure of arithmetic functions and connect to iterated dynamics. It distinguishes ω from faster-growing functions like φ and σ.",
