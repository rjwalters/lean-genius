  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "In 1900, David Hilbert asked whether a^b is transcendental when a is algebraic (not 0 or 1) and b is irrational algebraic. This was resolved independently by Aleksandr Gelfond and Theodor Schneider in 1934.\n\nFamous examples include 2^sqrt(2) (the Gelfond-Schneider constant) and e^pi (Gelfond's constant), both proven transcendental as corollaries.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Gelfond-Schneider):** If a and b are algebraic numbers with a not in {0, 1} and b irrational, then a^b is transcendental.\n\nHere a^b is defined as exp(b * log(a)) for an appropriate branch of the logarithm.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses the Gelfond-Schneider method:\n1. Assume for contradiction that a^b is algebraic\n2. Construct an auxiliary function with many zeros\n3. Apply Siegel's lemma to control coefficients\n4. Use analytic function theory to bound zeros\n5. Derive a contradiction",

    "summary": "The Gelfond-Schneider theorem resolves Hilbert's 7th Problem, showing that irrational powers of algebraic bases yield transcendental numbers. This reveals a fundamental barrier: the algebraic numbers cannot be closed under all natural operations.",
    "implications": "The theorem has profound implications for transcendence theory and was later generalized by Alan Baker to linear forms in logarithms, earning him the Fields Medal in 1970.",
