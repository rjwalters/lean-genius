What can be said about the density of this sequence?\n\nIn particular, in the case $n=1$, can one prove that $a_k/k\\to \\infty$ and $a_k/k^{1+c}\\to 0$ for any $c>0$?\n\n\n\nA problem of MacMahon, studied by Andrews \\cite{An75}. When $n=1$ this sequence begins\\[1,2,4,5,8,10,14,15,\\ldots.\\]This sequence is A002048 in the OEIS. Andrews conjectures\\[a_k\\sim \\frac{k\\log k}{\\log\\log k}.\\]Porubsky \\cite{Po77} proved that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many $k$ such that\\[a_k < (\\log k)^\\epsilon \\frac{k\\log k}{\\log\\log k},\\]and also that if $A(x)$ counts the number of $a_i\\leq x$ then\\[\\limsup \\frac{A(x)}{\\pi(x)}\\geq \\frac{1}{\\log 2}\\]where $\\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes $\\leq x$.\n\nSee also [839].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[An75] Andrews, George E., Research Problems: Mac Mahon's Prime Numbers of Measurement.
