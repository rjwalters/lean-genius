  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #766: Extremal Numbers and Graph Density**\n\nThis problem from Erdős's 1964 paper [Er64c] lies at the heart of extremal graph theory, the study of how graph structure constrains edge density.\n\n**Historical Background:**\n- **Turán (1941):** Foundational theorem determining ex(n;K_r) exactly\n- **Dirac & Erdős:** Independently proved the bipartite threshold result\n- **Kővári-Sós-Turán (1954):** ex(n;K_{s,t}) = O(n^{2-1/s}) for complete bipartite\n\n**The Central Question:**\nThe function f(n;k,l) takes the MINIMUM Turán number over all graphs with fixed vertex and edge counts. This inverts the usual question: instead of asking \"how many edges can we have avoiding one specific graph?\", we ask \"over all graphs with these parameters, which is easiest to avoid?\"\n\n**Significance:**\nUnderstanding f reveals how the \"shape\" of a forbidden graph (not just its size) affects extremal numbers. The transition at l = k²/4 marks where graphs must contain odd cycles, fundamentally changing their extremal behavior.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet f(n; k, l) = min ex(n; G) where G ranges over all graphs with k vertices and l edges.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Give good estimates for f(n; k, l) when k < l ≤ k²/4\n2. Is f(n; k, l) strictly monotone in l for fixed k and large n?\n\n**Known (Dirac-Erdős):**\nWhen l = ⌊k²/4⌋ + 1 (one edge beyond bipartite threshold):\nf(n; k, l) ≤ ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1\n\n**Status:** OPEN - Both main questions remain unresolved.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Basics:** Define graphs, edge counts, subgraph containment, H-freeness using Mathlib's SimpleGraph\n\n2. **Turán Number:** Define ex(n;H) as supremum of edges in H-free graphs\n\n3. **The f Function:** Take infimum over all (k,l)-graphs of their Turán numbers\n\n4. **Range Definition:** k < l ≤ k²/4 (bipartite threshold region)\n\n5. **Dirac-Erdős Theorem:** Axiomatize the result at l = ⌊k²/4⌋ + 1\n\n6. **Monotonicity:** Formalize the open question precisely\n\n7. **Special Cases:** Handle triangles, C₄, trees with specific bounds\n\n8. **Turán Density:** Connect to asymptotic density theory",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Turán Number ex(n;H):** Maximum edges in n-vertex H-free graph; central to extremal graph theory",
      "**Bipartite Threshold k²/4:** Complete bipartite K_{⌊k/2⌋,⌈k/2⌉} has this many edges; beyond this, graphs contain triangles",
      "**Dirac-Erdős Result:** At l = ⌊k²/4⌋+1, all graphs contain K₃, so f drops to triangle's Turán number ≈ n²/4",
      "**Monotonicity Intuition:** More edges in forbidden graph → harder to contain → host can have more edges",
      "**Weak vs Strong:** Non-decreasing (known) vs strictly increasing (OPEN)",
      "**C₄ Anomaly:** ex(n;C₄) = Θ(n^{3/2}), much smaller than quadratic; 4-cycles are hard to avoid",
      "**Trees vs Dense:** For trees (l=k-1), ex is nearly linear; for dense graphs, ex is quadratic"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #766 asks for estimates of f(n;k,l) = min ex(n;G) in the range k < l ≤ k²/4, and whether f is strictly monotone in l. The Dirac-Erdős theorem provides a key result at the bipartite threshold: when l exceeds k²/4, all (k,l)-graphs contain triangles, forcing f(n;k,l) ≤ ⌊n²/4⌋+1. The strict monotonicity question remains open.",
