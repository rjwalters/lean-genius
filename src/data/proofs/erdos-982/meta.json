    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #982** is a fundamental question in discrete geometry about the structure of convex polygons.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1946**: Erdos posed the original problem in \"On sets of distances of n points\"\n- **1952**: Moser proved the first lower bound f(n) >= ceil(n/3)\n- **1994**: Erdos and Fishburn improved this to f(n) >= floor(n/3 + 1)\n- **2006**: Dumitrescu pushed the bound to approximately 0.361n\n- **2013**: Nivasch, Pach, Pinchasi, and Zerbib achieved f(n) >= (13/36 + 1/22701)n - O(1)\n\n**Related Conjectures:**\nErdos originally conjectured something stronger: that every convex polygon has a vertex with no three equidistant vertices. This was disproved (see Problem #97). He also conjectured a continuous version for convex curves, which Barany and Roldan-Pensado showed is false as stated (acute triangle boundaries are counterexamples).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $f(n)$ denote the largest integer $k$ such that every convex $n$-gon has at least one vertex with at least $k$ distinct distances to other vertices.\n\n**Conjecture:** $f(n) \\geq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$\n\n**Best Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: $f(n) \\geq (13/36 + 1/22701)n - O(1) \\approx 0.361n$\n- Upper: $f(n) \\leq \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ (regular polygon)\n\nThe gap between known bounds and the conjecture is approximately $0.139n$.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** We define the Euclidean plane, distinct distance counting functions, and convex position predicates.\n\n2. **Known Bounds as Axioms:** The published results of Moser, Erdos-Fishburn, Dumitrescu, and Nivasch et al. are stated as axioms since their proofs are beyond current Mathlib capabilities.\n\n3. **Small Cases:** We verify the conjecture for triangles, quadrilaterals, and pentagons using the known bounds.\n\n4. **Related Results:** We formalize the disproved stronger conjecture and the curve generalization counterexamples.\n\n5. **Gap Analysis:** We compute the numerical gap between known results and the full conjecture.\n\n**Note:** This is an OPEN problem - the main conjecture is neither proved nor disproved.",

    "summary": "Erdos Problem #982 asks whether every convex n-gon has a vertex with at least floor(n/2) distinct distances to other vertices. The problem remains OPEN. The best known lower bound is approximately 0.361n (Nivasch et al. 2013), while the regular polygon shows the conjecture would be tight at ceil(n/2). The gap of about 0.139n represents substantial open mathematical territory.",
    "implications": "**Geometric Significance**\n\n1. **Distance Distribution:** Understanding how distances distribute from vertices in convex configurations.\n\n2. **Extremal Geometry:** The regular polygon appears optimal, suggesting deep connections to symmetry.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Geometry:** Part of broader questions about distinct distances (Erdos-Moser problem).\n\n4. **Continuous Analogues:** The curve generalization failures show the discrete and continuous settings differ fundamentally.",
