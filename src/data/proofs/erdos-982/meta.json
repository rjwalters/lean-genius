Moser \\cite{Mo52} proved that\\[f(n) \\geq \\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{3}\\right\\rceil.\\]This was improved by Erd\\H{o}s and Fishburn \\cite{ErFi94} to\\[f(n) \\geq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{3}+1\\right\\rfloor,\\]then\\[f(n) \\geq \\left\\lceil \\frac{13n-6}{36}\\right\\rceil\\]by Dumitrescu \\cite{Du06b}, and most recently\\[f(n) \\geq \\left(\\frac{13}{36}+\\frac{1}{22701}\\right)n-O(1)\\]by Nivasch, Pach, Pinchasi, and Zerbib \\cite{NPPZ13}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er46b} Erd\\H{o}s makes the even stronger conjecture that on every convex curve there exists a point $p$ such that every circle with centre $p$ intersects the curve in at most $2$ points. B\\'{a}r\\'{a}ny and Rold\\'{a}n-Pensado \\cite{BaRo13} noted that the boundary of any acute triangle is a counterexample.\n\nB\\'{a}r\\'{a}ny and Rold\\'{a}n-Pensado prove that, for any planar convex body, there is a point $p$ on the boundary such that every circle with centre $p$ intersects the boundary in at most $O(1)$ (where the implied constant depends on the convex body). They conjecture that there this can be bounded by an absolute constant - that is, Erd\\H{o}s's conjecture is true if we replace $2$ by some larger constant $C$.\n\nSee also [93].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaRo13] B\\'ar\\'any, Imre and Rold\\'an-Pensado, Edgardo, A question from a famous paper of {E}rd\\H{o}s.
