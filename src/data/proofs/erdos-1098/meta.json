  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was asked by Erdős at the 15th Summer Research Institute of the Australian Mathematical Society in 1975. Neumann solved it in 1976, proving the elegant equivalence between no infinite clique and finite index center.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a group and Γ(G) be the non-commuting graph (edges between gh ≠ hg). If Γ has no infinite clique, is there a finite bound on clique sizes?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the non-commuting graph, cliques, and the center Z(G). Neumann's theorem states that no infinite clique ⟺ [G : Z(G)] < ∞, and the bound is exactly the index.",

      "Non-commuting graph edges exist between g,h when gh ≠ hg",
      "Clique members must be in different cosets of Z(G)",
      "Hence clique size ≤ [G : Z(G)]",

      "The answer is YES - uniformly bounded by the center's index"
