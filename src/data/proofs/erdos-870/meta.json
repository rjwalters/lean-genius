  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about additive bases - sets A ⊆ ℕ where every large integer is a sum of at most k elements from A. A minimal basis has no proper subset that is also a basis. Erdős and Nathanson (1979) proved that for k = 2, if representations grow logarithmically, the basis contains a minimal basis. Härtter (1956) and Nathanson (1974) showed that without growth conditions, bases may contain no minimal bases.",
