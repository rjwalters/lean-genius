If $A$ is the set of squares (or the set of $p\\pm 1$ for $p$ prime) then he had no guess.\n\nSolved by Verstra\\\"{e}te \\cite{Ve05}, who gave a non-constructive proof that such a set $A$ exists.\n\nLiu and Montgomery \\cite{LiMo20} proved that in fact this is true when $A$ is the set of powers of $2$ (more generally any set of even numbers which doesn't grow too quickly) - in particular this contradicts the previous belief of Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bo77] Bollob\\'{a}s, B\\'{e}la, Cycles modulo $k$.
