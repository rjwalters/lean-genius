The answer is yes. This was proved for $N$ prime by Olson \\cite{Ol68}, and for all $N$ by Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{Sz70} (in fact for arbitrary finite abelian groups).\n\nErd\\H{o}s speculated that perhaps the correct threshold is $(2N)^{1/2}$; this is also a conjecture of Selfridge, and has been proved when $N$ is prime by Balandraud \\cite{Ba12}.\n\nHamidoune and Z\\'{e}mor \\cite{HaZe96} proved the bound $(1+o(1))\\sqrt{2N}$ for arbitrary abelian groups of order $N$.\n\nThis is discussed in problem C15 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ba12] Balandraud, \\'{e}ric, An addition theorem and maximal zero-sum free sets in {${\\Bbb\nZ}/p{\\Bbb Z}$}.
