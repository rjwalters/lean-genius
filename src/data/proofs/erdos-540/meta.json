  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős-Heilbronn conjecture (1964) asked whether large subsets of ℤ/Nℤ necessarily contain zero-sum subsets. Olson proved it for primes in 1968, and Szemerédi proved the general case in 1970. Balandraud (2012) showed √(2N) is the exact threshold for primes.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that if A ⊆ ℤ/Nℤ has size ≫ √N then there exists some non-empty S ⊆ A such that Σₛ∈S s ≡ 0 (mod N)?\n\nAnswer: YES. The threshold is (1+o(1))√(2N) for general N, and exactly √(2N) for primes.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the main results: Olson's theorem for primes, Szemerédi's general case, and Balandraud's optimal threshold. The proof ideas involve pigeonhole arguments on subset sums and additive structure theorems.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The threshold √(2N) comes from counting subset sums vs group size",
      "For primes, the threshold is exactly √(2N) (Balandraud)",
      "The key technique is showing sum collisions force zero-sums via symmetric differences",
