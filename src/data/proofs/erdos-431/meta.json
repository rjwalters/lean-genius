The answer is surely no. The best result in this direction is due to Elsholtz and Harper \\cite{ElHa15}, who showed that if $A,B$ are such sets then for all large $x$ we must have\\[\\frac{x^{1/2}}{\\log x\\log\\log x} \\ll \\lvert A \\cap [1,x]\\rvert \\ll x^{1/2}\\log\\log x\\]and similarly for $B$.\n\nElsholtz \\cite{El01} has proved there are no sets $A,B,C$ (all of size at least $2$) such that $A+B+C$ agrees with the set of prime numbers up to finitely many exceptions.\n\nGranville \\cite{Gr90} proved, conditional on the prime $k$-tuples conjecture, that there are infinite sets $B$ and $C$ such that\\[\\{ \\tfrac{b+c}{2}: b\\in B, c\\in C\\}\\]is a subset of the primes. Tao and Ziegler \\cite{TaZi23} gave an unconditional proof that there are infinite sets $B=\\{b_1<\\cdots\\}$ and $C=\\{c_1<\\cdots\\}$ such that\\[\\{ b_i+c_j : b_i\\in B, c_j\\in C, i<j\\}\\]is a subset of the primes.\n\nSee also [429] and [432].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[El01] Elsholtz, Christian, The inverse Goldbach problem.
