  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is known as Ostmann's 'inverse Goldbach problem'. While Goldbach conjectured that every even number > 2 is a sum of two primes (Primes + Primes ⊇ evens), Ostmann asked the reverse: can A + B = Primes for some infinite A, B? The answer is widely believed to be NO.\n\nThe best partial result is due to Elsholtz and Harper (2015), who proved that if such A, B exist, they must satisfy extremely restrictive growth bounds: for large x, x^{1/2}/(log x · log log x) ≪ |A ∩ [1,x]| ≪ x^{1/2} · log log x, and similarly for B. This narrows the search space significantly.\n\nElsholtz (2001) completely resolved the three-set case: no A, B, C (with |A|, |B|, |C| ≥ 2) can satisfy A + B + C = Primes (mod finite). This shows the problem gets strictly harder with fewer sets.\n\nTao and Ziegler (2023) proved a positive result in the opposite direction: there exist infinite B, C such that the restricted sumset {bᵢ + cⱼ : i < j} is entirely contained in the primes.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A + B = \\{a + b : a \\in A, b \\in B\\}$ denote the sumset. Two sets $S, T \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ **agree up to finitely many exceptions** if $(S \\setminus T) \\cup (T \\setminus S)$ is finite.\n\n**Question**: Do there exist infinite sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A + B$ agrees with the set of primes up to finitely many exceptions?\n\n**Conjecture**: NO.\n\n**Known Results**:\n- Elsholtz-Harper (2015): If such $A, B$ exist, then $\\frac{x^{1/2}}{\\log x \\cdot \\log\\log x} \\ll |A \\cap [1,x]| \\ll x^{1/2} \\cdot \\log\\log x$\n- Elsholtz (2001): No three sets $A, B, C$ satisfy $A + B + C =$ primes (mod finite)\n- Tao-Ziegler (2023): Infinite sets with restricted sums entirely in primes exist\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the sumset A + B and the notion of two sets agreeing up to finitely many exceptions. The main conjecture (InverseGoldbachConjecture) states no infinite pair A, B satisfies the inverse Goldbach property. Key results are axiomatized: Elsholtz-Harper growth bounds, Elsholtz's three-set impossibility, and Tao-Ziegler's restricted sumset construction. Heuristic arguments are sketched showing why the conjecture should be true: sumsets of √x-sized sets contain roughly x elements, while primes up to x number only x/log(x).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Size mismatch heuristic**: If |A ∩ [1,x]| ~ √x and |B ∩ [1,x]| ~ √x, then |A+B ∩ [1,2x]| ~ x, but π(2x) ~ x/log(x). These don't match for large x.",
      "**Three sets is too many**: Elsholtz (2001) completely ruled out A + B + C = Primes (mod finite), showing additional degrees of freedom make the problem easier.",
      "**Tight growth bounds**: Elsholtz-Harper (2015) proved any hypothetical A, B must have counting functions squeezed between x^{1/2}/(log x · log log x) and x^{1/2} · log log x.",
      "**Restricted sums work**: Tao-Ziegler (2023) showed that with the restriction i < j on indices, infinite B, C with B + C ⊆ Primes exist. The full sumset is harder.",
      "**Connection to Goldbach**: This is the 'inverse' of Goldbach's conjecture, asking if primes can be GENERATED as a sumset rather than being a SOURCE for sumsets."
