    "problemStatement": "Let $A\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ be such that every large integer can be written as $n^2+a$ for some $a\\in A$ and $n\\geq 0$. What is the smallest possible value of\\[\\limsup \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}?\\]Is\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}>1?\\] Such a set $A$ is called an additive complement of the set of squares. Erdős observed that there exist $A$ for which the $\\limsup$ is finite and $>1$. Moser [Mo65] proved that, for any such $A$,\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}>1.06.\\]The best-known lower bound is\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}\\geq\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\approx 1.273\\]proved by Cilleruelo [Ci93], Habsieger [Ha95], and Balasubramanian and Ramana [BaRa01]. The problem of minimising the $\\limsup$ appears to have been much less studied. van Doorn has a construction of such an $A$ in which, for all $N$,\\[\\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}} View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 27 Dec",
