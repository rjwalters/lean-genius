    "historicalContext": "Bondy conjectured bounds on h(n) in 1971 but without published proofs. Griffin (2013) gave the first proof of the lower bound log₂(n−1) − 1 ≤ h(n). George, Khodkar, and Wallis (2016) proved the upper bound h(n) ≤ log₂ n + log* n + O(1). Erdős believed the upper bound is correct but could not prove h(n) − log₂ n → ∞.",
