  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1965 at a symposium on extremal problems in number theory. The problem asks about the longest intervals where all integers have a 'large' prime factor. Tao provided the first non-trivial upper bound via a simple pigeonhole argument, while Tang improved Erdős's original lower bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k(n) be the maximal k such that there exists m ≤ n where each of m+1, ..., m+k is divisible by at least one prime greater than k. Estimate k(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the k(n) function, establishes basic properties like monotonicity, then axiomatizes the known bounds: Tang's lower bound exp((1/√2-o(1))√(log n log log n)) and Tao's upper bound (1+o(1))√n. The conjecture k(n) = o(n^ε) remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "k(n) measures the longest 'large prime factor' interval below n",
      "Lower bound uses sieve methods to avoid small primes",
      "Upper bound uses pigeonhole: if k > √n, some small prime divides two nearby integers",
      "The gap between bounds is enormous (subpolynomial vs polynomial)",
