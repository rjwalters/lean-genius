    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #962: Consecutive Integers with Large Prime Divisors**\n\nErdős posed this problem in 1965 at a symposium on extremal problems in number theory, published in [Er65]. The problem asks about the longest intervals of consecutive integers where each has a 'large' prime factor exceeding the interval length.\n\n**Key Contributions:**\n- **Erdős (1965):** Established the first lower bound k(n) ≫_ε exp((log n)^{1/2-ε}) using sieve methods\n- **Terence Tao:** Provided the first non-trivial upper bound k(n) ≤ (1+o(1))√n via a simple but elegant pigeonhole argument\n- **Quanyu Tang:** Improved the lower bound to k(n) ≥ exp((1/√2-o(1))√(log n · log log n))\n\nThe problem connects to smooth number theory: an integer is k-smooth if all prime factors are ≤ k, so k(n) measures the longest interval of non-smooth integers.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k(n) be the maximal k such that there exists m ≤ n where each of m+1, ..., m+k is divisible by at least one prime greater than k. Estimate k(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach:**\n\n1. **Definitions:** We define the largest prime factor function lpf(n), the predicate HasLargePrimeFactor, and the IsValidInterval property for consecutive integer intervals.\n\n2. **The k(n) Function:** Defined via supremum as the largest k where a valid interval of length k exists with starting point ≤ n.\n\n3. **Axiomatized Results:** The main bounds are axiomatized since they require analytic number theory beyond Mathlib:\n   - Tang's lower bound: k(n) ≥ exp((1/√2-o(1))√(log n · log log n))\n   - Tao's upper bound: k(n) ≤ (1+o(1))√n\n\n4. **Tao's Pigeonhole Argument:** We sketch the key idea - if k > √n, some small prime divides two numbers in the interval, contradiction.\n\n5. **Smooth Number Connection:** We reformulate k(n) in terms of non-smooth number intervals, connecting to established smooth number theory.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Valid Intervals:** k(n) measures the longest interval {m+1,...,m+k} where every integer has a prime factor exceeding k",
      "**Sieve Methods:** Erdős's lower bound uses sieve techniques to find intervals where small primes 'miss' consecutive integers",
      "**Pigeonhole Argument:** Tao's upper bound: if k > √n, by pigeonhole some prime p ≤ k divides two numbers in {m+1,...,m+k} at distance ≤ p < k, contradiction",
      "**Tang's Constant:** The constant 1/√2 ≈ 0.707 in Tang's lower bound arises from optimizing over prime sieves",
      "**Enormous Gap:** Lower bound is subpolynomial exp(√(log n log log n)), upper bound is polynomial √n - closing this gap is the central open problem",
      "**Smooth Numbers:** k(n) equals the longest interval of non-k-smooth numbers below n, connecting to well-studied smooth number density"
