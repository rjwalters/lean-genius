Or is this true only for almost all $n$, and $\\limsup f(n)/n=\\infty$?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s reported in problem B2 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}. The function $f(n)$ is undefined for $n=2$ and $n=5$, but is likely well-defined for all $n\\geq 6$ (which would follow from a strong form of Goldbach's conjecture).\n\nThe sequence of values of $f(n)$ is given by A167485 in the OEIS.\n\nSee also [468].\n\nThe strong claim that $f(n)=o(n)$ was disproved by Tao in the comments to [468], in which he proves that the upper density of $\\{ n : f(n)\\leq \\delta n\\}$ is $\\ll \\delta^2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
