    "significance": "Tao's result shows the conjecture is 'almost' true in a precise density sense, but does not rule out sparse exceptions."

    "content": "The number of m ≤ x that reach 1 is at least x^{0.84}. This is a counting result: not just density 1, but a power-law lower bound on the number of 'good' integers.",
    "significance": "Combined with Tao's result, this shows the Collatz conjecture holds for an overwhelmingly dense set of integers."
