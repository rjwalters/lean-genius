  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Komjáth and appears in [Er87]. It concerns 'Property B' for families of infinite sets - the existence of 2-colorings avoiding monochromatic members.\n\nProperty B is well-studied for finite hypergraphs (where it always holds for 2-uniform). The extension to infinite sets with specific intersection constraints is more subtle.\n\nThe condition that intersections ≠ 1 is crucial and non-obvious. Single-element intersections allow counterexamples via constraint-forcing arguments.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet (A_i) be a family of sets where |A_i| = ℵ₀ for all i. For any i ≠ j, the intersection |A_i ∩ A_j| is finite and not equal to 1.\n\n**Question:** Is there a 2-coloring of ∪A_i such that no A_i is monochromatic?\n\n**Conditions:**\n- Each A_i is countably infinite\n- Pairwise intersections are finite (almost disjoint)\n- No intersection has exactly one element",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Set Families:** Define SetFamily as I → Set U with cardinality conditions\n\n2. **Intersection Conditions:** HasFiniteIntersection, IntersectionNotOne, ValidIntersection\n\n3. **Colorings:** TwoColoring as U → Bool, IsMonochromatic predicate\n\n4. **Property B:** FamilyHasPropertyB as existence of valid coloring\n\n5. **Conjecture:** ErdosConjecture602 asserts every Erdős family has Property B\n\n6. **Special Cases:** Disjoint families, almost disjoint families",
