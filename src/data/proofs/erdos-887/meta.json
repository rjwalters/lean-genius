  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #887** was posed by Erdős and Rosenfeld in 1997.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős-Rosenfeld (1997):** Proved infinitely many n have 4 divisors in the interval, asked if 4 is the maximum.\n- **Tsz Ho Chan (2013):** Proved perfect squares have at most 5 divisors in such intervals.\n- **Letendre (2025):** Further results on divisors in short intervals.\n\n**Key Insight:** The problem asks about the concentration of divisors near √n. The interval width n^{1/4} is critical: larger makes the problem trivial, smaller makes it too restrictive.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nIs there an absolute constant $K$ such that, for every $C > 0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then $n$ has at most $K$ divisors in $(\\sqrt{n}, \\sqrt{n} + C n^{1/4})$?\n\n**What we know:**\n- **Lower bound:** Infinitely many n have exactly 4 divisors in the interval\n- **Perfect squares:** At most 5 divisors (Chan 2013)\n- **Conjecture:** K = 4 suffices\n\n**The general case remains OPEN.**",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Basic Definitions:** Define divisors, divisor function, and counting divisors in intervals.\n\n2. **Conjecture Statement:** Formalize the Erdős-Rosenfeld conjecture as existence of universal K.\n\n3. **Known Results:** Axiomatize the Erdős-Rosenfeld result (4 is achievable) and Chan's theorem (perfect squares ≤ 5).\n\n4. **Variations:** Define related problems with different interval sizes and exponents.\n\n5. **Status:** Document that the general case is open while partial results are known.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Critical Exponent:** The n^{1/4} interval width is special: α > 1/2 allows unbounded divisors, α < 1/4 gives at most 2.",
      "**Divisor Pairs:** For d | n, both d and n/d are divisors. Near √n, these are close to each other.",
      "**Perfect Squares:** √n is itself a divisor, which is why the bound is 5 instead of 4.",
      "**Construction:** n with 4 divisors in the interval come from products of 4 carefully chosen primes.",
      "**Rarity:** Numbers achieving 4 divisors are infinite but sparse among all integers.",
      "**Multiplication Table:** Related to how integers appear in the multiplication table."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #887 asks whether there is a universal constant K bounding the number of divisors any n can have in the interval (√n, √n + C·n^{1/4}). Erdős and Rosenfeld showed 4 is achievable infinitely often and conjectured this is the maximum. Chan proved perfect squares have at most 5 divisors in such intervals. The general case remains OPEN.",
    "implications": "**Implications for Number Theory**\n\n1. **Divisor Distribution:** Understanding how divisors cluster near √n reveals structure of integers.\n\n2. **Multiplication Table:** Connected to the distribution of products in the multiplication table.\n\n3. **Prime Factorization:** The problem constrains how prime factors can combine to create nearby divisors.\n\n4. **Critical Exponents:** The n^{1/4} exponent marks a phase transition in divisor behavior.",
