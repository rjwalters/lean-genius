  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was asked by Erdős and Newman. Erdős (1980) first showed the answer is NO for C = 3, 4 and infinitely many other values of C. Nešetřil and Rödl (1985) gave the complete negative answer: NO for ALL C, even when the number of partition pieces is allowed to depend on A itself. The proof uses Ramsey-theoretic methods.",
    "problemStatement": "Suppose A ⊆ ℕ and C > 0 is such that 1_A * 1_A(n) ≤ C for all n ∈ ℕ (i.e., every integer has at most C representations as a sum of two elements from A). Can A be partitioned into t = t(C) subsets A₁,...,Aₜ such that 1_{Aᵢ} * 1_{Aᵢ}(n) < C for all 1 ≤ i ≤ t and n ∈ ℕ?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the representation function r_A(n) = |{(a,b) ∈ A² : a + b = n}|, bounded convolution, and the partition question. The Nešetřil-Rödl theorem is axiomatized: for every C ≥ 1, there exists a 'bad' set A with r_A ≤ C that cannot be partitioned into pieces with r < C, no matter how many pieces are used.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #328 is DISPROVED. Nešetřil and Rödl (1985) showed that for ALL values of C ≥ 1, there exist sets A with bounded convolution r_A ≤ C that cannot be partitioned into ANY number of pieces with strictly smaller convolution r_{Aᵢ} < C. This is a fundamental obstruction in additive combinatorics, showing that bounded representation is a robust property.",
    "implications": "The result demonstrates that the additive structure captured by the representation function cannot be 'improved' through partition arguments. This has implications for the theory of Sidon sets (B₂ sequences), B_h sequences, and more generally for understanding when additive properties are hereditary under partition.",
