Can $A$ be partitioned into $t$ many subsets $A_1,\\ldots,A_t$ (where $t=t(C)$ depends only on $C$) such that $1_{A_i}\\ast 1_{A_i}(n)<C$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq t$ and $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Newman. Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{NeRo85} have shown the answer is no for all $C$ (even if $t$ is also allowed to depend on $A$).\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er80e} had previously shown the answer is no for $C=3,4$ and infinitely many other values of $C$.\n\nSee also [774].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er80e] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some applications of Ramsey's theorem to additive number\ntheory.
