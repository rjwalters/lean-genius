A similar question can be asked for the set of $k$th powers for any $k\\geq 3$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er95} Erd\\H{o}s reported that Burr had proved that the set of $k$th powers is Ramsey $r$ complete for all $r,k\\geq 2$, but this result was never published. A stronger version was proved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham \\cite{CFP21}, who proved that in fact the set of $k$th powers contains a sparse Ramsey $r$-complete subsequence, again for every $r,k\\geq 2$.\n\nSee also [54] and [55].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFP21] Conlon, D. and Fox, J. and Pham, H.
