They conjecture that this maximum is either $N/p$ (where $p$ is the smallest prime factor of $N$) or it is the number of integers $\\{2t: t\\leq N/2\\textrm{ and }(2t,N)> 1\\}$.\n\nAhlswede and Khachatrian \\cite{AhKh96} observe that it is 'easy' to find a counterexample to this conjecture, which they informed Erd\\H{o}s about in 1992. Erd\\H{o}s then gave a refined conjecture, that if $N=q_1^{k_1}\\cdots q_r^{k_r}$ (where $q_1<\\cdots <q_r$ are distinct primes) then the maximum is achieved by, for some $1\\leq j\\leq r$, those integers in $[1,N]$ which are a multiple of at least one of\\[\\{2q_1,\\ldots,2q_j,q_1\\cdots q_j\\}.\\]This conjecture was proved by Ahlswede and Khachatrian \\cite{AhKh96}.\n\nSee also [56].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AhKh96] Ahlswede, Rudolf and Khachatrian, Levon H., Sets of integers with pairwise common divisor and a factor\nfrom a specified set of primes.
