  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #752** was posed by Erdős, Faudree, and Schelp about cycle lengths in graphs with high girth.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős-Faudree-Schelp (original):** Proved the case s = 2 and conjectured the general result.\n- **Sudakov-Verstraëte (2008):** Proved the full conjecture and a stronger version: under average degree k and girth > 2s, there are Ω(k^s) consecutive even cycle lengths.\n\n**Key Insight:** The tension between high girth (no short cycles) and high degree (forcing many cycles) creates structure that guarantees many distinct cycle lengths.\n\nThe result is tight up to constants: Moore graphs show that Ω(k^s) cannot be improved.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet $G$ be a graph with minimum degree $k$ and girth $> 2s$ (i.e., $G$ contains no cycles of length $\\leq 2s$). Must there be $\\gg k^s$ many distinct cycle lengths in $G$?\n\n**Answer:** YES\n\n**Sudakov-Verstraëte (2008) proved a stronger result:**\nUnder the assumption of average degree $k$ and girth $> 2s$, there are at least $\\Omega(k^s)$ many consecutive even integers which are cycle lengths in $G$.\n\n**The bound is tight:** Moore graphs achieve approximately $k^s$ vertices, limiting cycle diversity.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define minimum degree, girth, and cycle lengths using Mathlib's SimpleGraph.\n\n2. **Conjecture Statement:** Formalize the Erdős-Faudree-Schelp conjecture as existence of constant c > 0.\n\n3. **Sudakov-Verstraëte Theorem:** Axiomatize the stronger result about consecutive even cycle lengths.\n\n4. **Main Theorem:** Derive the conjecture from the stronger result.\n\n5. **Tightness:** Reference Moore graphs and Moore bound to show the result is optimal.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Girth Constraint:** Girth > 2s means the shortest cycle has length ≥ 2s + 1, forbidding short cycles.",
      "**Degree Forcing:** High minimum degree forces many edges, which must create cycles of various lengths.",
      "**Consecutive Even Lengths:** The Sudakov-Verstraëte result is stronger: not just many lengths, but consecutive even ones.",
      "**Moore Bound:** Graphs with min degree d and girth > 2s have at least Ω(d^s) vertices, showing tightness.",
      "**BFS Structure:** In high-girth graphs, BFS trees have no cross-edges within distance s, creating structure.",
      "**Chromatic Extension:** The result also holds for chromatic number ≥ k instead of minimum degree."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #752 asked whether graphs with minimum degree k and girth > 2s must contain ≫ k^s distinct cycle lengths. Sudakov and Verstraëte (2008) proved this affirmatively, and showed an even stronger result: such graphs contain Ω(k^s) consecutive even cycle lengths. The bound is tight due to Moore graphs.",
    "implications": "**Implications for Graph Theory**\n\n1. **Extremal Graph Theory:** Establishes precise relationship between girth and cycle diversity.\n\n2. **Moore Graphs:** Shows these graphs are extremal not just for vertex count but for cycle structure.\n\n3. **Chromatic Number:** The result extends to chromatic number bounds, connecting coloring and cycles.\n\n4. **Consecutive Lengths:** The stronger consecutive result has algorithmic implications for finding cycles.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the optimal constant in the Ω(k^s) bound?",
      "Can the average degree condition be weakened to minimum degree with the same bounds?",
      "Are there Ω(k^s) consecutive odd cycle lengths as well?",
      "What happens for directed graphs?",
      "Can the proof be made constructive to find cycles efficiently?"
