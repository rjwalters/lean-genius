Must there be $\\gg k^s$ many distinct cycle lengths in $G$?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree, and Schelp, who proved it when $s=2$.\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by Sudakov and Verstra\\\"{e}te \\cite{SuVe08}, who in fact proved that under the assumption of average degree $k$ and girth $>2s$ there are at least $\\gg k^s$ many consecutive even integers which are cycle lengths in $G$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[SuVe08] Sudakov, Benny and Verstra\\\"{e}te, Jacques, Cycle lengths in sparse graphs.
