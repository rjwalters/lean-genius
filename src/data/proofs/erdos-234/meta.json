  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether the density of integers n with normalized prime gap (p_{n+1}-p_n)/log n < c exists and is continuous. Cramér's 1936 probabilistic model predicts an exponential distribution f(c) = 1 - e^{-c}. Gallagher (1976) proved this holds conditional on the Riemann Hypothesis. The unconditional question remains open. Related to Problem 233 (sum of squared gaps) and Problem 5 (large prime gaps).",
    "problemStatement": "For every c ≥ 0, does the density f(c) = lim_{N→∞} #{n ≤ N : (p_{n+1}-p_n)/log n < c}/N exist, and is f continuous?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define nthPrime, primeGap, normalizedGap, and gapProportion. The conjecture ErdosProblem234 asserts both existence and continuity. We prove basic properties (f(0)=0, non-negativity) and define Cramér's exponential prediction. Gallagher's conditional result is axiomatized, and we prove it implies the full conjecture. Partial results on small gaps, large gaps, and average gap are stated.",
