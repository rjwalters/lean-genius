    "historicalContext": "Kepler conjectured in 1611 that the FCC lattice achieves maximum sphere packing density. Hales proved this in 1998 with a computer-assisted proof, formally verified by Flyspeck (2014).",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Kepler-Hales):** The maximum density for sphere packing in R^3 is pi/(3*sqrt(2)) approx 74.05%, achieved by the face-centered cubic lattice.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof involves:\n1. Reducing to finite local configurations\n2. Computer verification of thousands of cases\n3. Formal verification in HOL Light (Flyspeck)",

      "FCC packing is optimal (74.05% density)",
      "In 2D, hexagonal packing achieves 90.69%",
