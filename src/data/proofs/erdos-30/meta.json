  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A Sidon set (or B₂ sequence) is a set of integers where all pairwise sums are distinct. Named after Simon Sidon who studied these in the context of Fourier series.\n\nErdős and Turán (1941) proved h(N) ≤ N^{1/2} + N^{1/4} + 1, where h(N) is the maximum size of a Sidon set in {1,...,N}. This bound stood for 80 years with only minor improvements to the constant.\n\nIn 2021, Balogh-Füredi-Roy finally improved the coefficient of N^{1/4} to 0.998. Carter-Hunter-O'Bryant (2025) further reduced it to 0.98183. But the N^{1/4} exponent itself remains stubbornly fixed.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős-Turán, OPEN):** For every ε > 0,\n\nh(N) = N^{1/2} + O_ε(N^ε)\n\n**Current best:**\n- Upper: N^{1/2} + 0.98183·N^{1/4} + O(1) (Carter-Hunter-O'Bryant 2025)\n- Lower: (1-o(1))·N^{1/2} (Singer 1938)\n\n**The prize:** $1,000 for proving or disproving.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `IsSidonSet A`: all pairwise sums are distinct\n2. `HasDistinctSums A`: equivalent characterization\n3. `sidonNumber N`: maximum size h(N)\n4. `Erdos30Conjecture`: h(N) = N^{1/2} + O_ε(N^ε)\n\nWe axiomatize:\n- Erdős-Turán (1941): N^{1/2} + N^{1/4} + 1\n- Lindström (1969): slight improvement\n- Balogh-Füredi-Roy (2021): 0.998 coefficient\n- Carter-Hunter-O'Bryant (2025): 0.98183 coefficient\n- Singer (1938): lower bound via perfect difference sets",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The N^{1/4} barrier:** Despite 80+ years of work, the error term exponent 1/4 hasn't been improved. The conjecture asks if it can be any ε > 0.",
      "**Perfect difference sets:** Singer's construction uses finite projective geometry to build near-optimal Sidon sets, giving the lower bound.",
      "**Counting argument limit:** The N^{1/4} comes from counting collisions among sums. Breaking this requires new structural insights.",
      "**B_h generalization:** Sidon sets are B₂ sets. The problem generalizes to B_h sets where all h-wise sums are distinct.",
      "**Even stronger conjecture:** Erdős speculated h(N) = N^{1/2} + O(1) might be true, but considered this 'too optimistic'."
