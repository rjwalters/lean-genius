  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #859 studies the natural density of integers n for which a given t can be represented as a sum of distinct divisors of n. This connects divisibility theory with combinatorics.\n\nIn his 1970 paper 'Some extremal problems in combinatorial number theory', Erdős proved:\n- The density dₜ exists for all t (nontrivial since not all sets have density)\n- The density is always positive for t > 0\n- There exist constants c₃, c₄ > 0 such that 1/(log t)^c₃ < dₜ < 1/(log t)^c₄\n\nThe open question asks whether dₜ has a precise asymptotic form c₁/(log t)^c₂.",
    "problemStatement": "Let t ≥ 1 and let dₜ be the density of integers n ∈ ℕ for which t can be represented as a sum of distinct divisors of n.\n\n**Question**: Do there exist constants c₁, c₂ > 0 such that\n$$ d_t \\sim \\frac{c_1}{(\\log t)^{c_2}} $$\nas t → ∞?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Known (Erdős 1970)**: 1/(log t)^c₃ < dₜ < 1/(log t)^c₄ for some c₃, c₄ > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by:\n\n1. **DivisorSumSet t**: The set of n where t is a subset sum of divisors of n\n2. **Natural density**: The limiting proportion #{n ≤ N : n ∈ S}/N\n3. **Basic examples**: t = 0 gives density 1, t = 1 gives density 1, t = 2 gives density 1/2\n4. **Erdős's bounds**: Axiomatize the 1970 upper/lower bounds\n5. **Practical numbers**: Connection to n where ALL k ≤ σ(n) are representable\n6. **Subset sum**: The combinatorial structure of divisor subset sums",

      "**Natural density**: dₜ = lim_{N→∞} #{n ≤ N : n ∈ DivisorSumSet t}/N. Not all sets have density, but Erdős proved DivisorSumSet t does.",
      "**Bounds decay like (log t)^{-c}**: As t grows, fewer n can represent t. The density decays, but the precise rate is unknown.",
