  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Squaring the circle - constructing a square with the same area as a given circle using only ruler and compass - was a famous problem from antiquity. Lindemann's 1882 proof that pi is transcendental finally proved this impossible, as only algebraic numbers are constructible.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem**: Pi is transcendental, i.e., there is no nonzero polynomial P with integer coefficients such that P(pi) = 0.\n\n**Corollary**: Squaring the circle is impossible with ruler and compass.",
    "proofStrategy": "Lindemann's proof extends Hermite's method for e. It shows that for any distinct algebraic numbers alpha_1,...,alpha_n, the expression sum of beta_i * e^(alpha_i) cannot be zero unless all beta_i are zero. Since e^(i*pi) = -1, this implies pi is transcendental.",
