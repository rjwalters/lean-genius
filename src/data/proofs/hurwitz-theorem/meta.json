  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Adolf Hurwitz proved this theorem in 1898, though the individual identities were known earlier. Brahmagupta discovered the 2-square identity in 628 CE. Euler found the 4-square identity in 1748. Degen published the 8-square identity in 1818.\n\nThe theorem has a famous historical lesson: William Rowan Hamilton spent 15 years (1828-1843) trying to extend complex numbers to three dimensions. He wanted 'triplets' that would do for 3D geometry what complex numbers do for the plane. On October 16, 1843, he finally realized he needed FOUR dimensions, not three, and discovered quaternions. Hurwitz's theorem explains why: there simply cannot be a 3-dimensional normed division algebra!\n\nThe theorem connects to deep areas of mathematics: topology (parallelizable spheres), physics (the four fundamental forces correspond to gauge groups built from these algebras), and even string theory (the octonions appear in exceptional Lie groups).",
    "problemStatement": "Hurwitz's Theorem:\n\nAn identity of the form\n$$(x_1^2 + \\cdots + x_n^2)(y_1^2 + \\cdots + y_n^2) = z_1^2 + \\cdots + z_n^2$$\nwhere each $z_i$ is a bilinear function of the $x_j$ and $y_k$, exists **only for n = 1, 2, 4, 8**.\n\nEquivalently: The only finite-dimensional real normed division algebras are:\n- $\\mathbb{R}$ (dimension 1) - the real numbers\n- $\\mathbb{C}$ (dimension 2) - the complex numbers\n- $\\mathbb{H}$ (dimension 4) - the quaternions\n- $\\mathbb{O}$ (dimension 8) - the octonions",
    "proofStrategy": "We prove the theorem in two directions:\n\n**Existence (n = 1, 2, 4, 8):**\n\n1. **n = 1**: Trivial identity $x^2 \\cdot y^2 = (xy)^2$\n\n2. **n = 2**: Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity\n   $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac-bd)^2 + (ad+bc)^2$\n   This encodes complex number multiplication!\n\n3. **n = 4**: Euler's identity uses quaternion multiplication\n\n4. **n = 8**: Degen's identity from octonion multiplication\n\n**Non-existence (n = 3):**\n\nThis is the key original contribution. We prove n=3 is impossible using a purely algebraic approach:\n\n1. **Setup**: An NSquareIdentity defines 9 unit vectors $m_{ij} = \\text{mul}(e_i, e_j)$\n2. **Orthonormality**: Rows and columns form orthonormal bases in $\\mathbb{R}^3$\n3. **Parseval Identity**: We prove $|w|^2 = \\langle w, v_1 \\rangle^2 + \\langle w, v_2 \\rangle^2 + \\langle w, v_3 \\rangle^2$ for any orthonormal basis\n4. **Key Lemma**: A vector orthogonal to an orthonormal triple in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ must be zero (matrix invertibility proof)\n5. **Contradiction**: The constraints force $m_{13} = \\pm m_{21}$ and $m_{23} = \\pm m_{11}$, but column 3 orthogonality then fails\n\nNo topology required - pure linear algebra!",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Hurwitz's Theorem establishes one of the deepest constraints in algebra: only four dimensions (1, 2, 4, 8) admit n-square identities. We've proven the 1, 2, and 4-square identities completely, and—as a key original contribution—we've given a complete formal proof that n=3 is impossible using the Parseval identity and matrix methods, without relying on topology.",
    "implications": "This theorem has far-reaching consequences. It explains Hamilton's 15-year failure to find 3-dimensional 'triplets'. It connects to topology through parallelizable spheres. The four algebras appear throughout physics: complex numbers in quantum mechanics, quaternions in rotations and relativity, octonions in string theory and exceptional structures. The theorem is a rare example where mathematics itself sets hard limits on what algebraic structures can exist.",
