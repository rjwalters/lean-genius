Must there exist an absolute constant $c>0$ such that\\[\\max_{1\\leq k\\leq n}\\left\\lvert \\sum_{i}z_i^k\\right\\rvert>c?\\]\n\n\n\nA problem of Tur\\'{a}n, who proved that this maximum is $\\gg 1/n$. This was solved by Atkinson \\cite{At61b}, who showed that $c=1/6$ suffices. This has been improved by Bir\\'{o}, first to $c=1/2$ \\cite{Bi94}, and later to an absolute constant $c>1/2$ \\cite{Bi00}. Based on computational evidence it is likely that the optimal value of $c$ is $\\approx 0.7$.\n\nSee also [973].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[At61b] Atkinson, F.
