  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about a greedy coprime sieve in 1977 (p.64) and it appears in Erdős–Graham (1980, p.91). Given n, one greedily selects a₀ = 0, a₁ = 1, and each aₖ as the smallest integer exceeding aₖ₋₁ with n - aₖ coprime to all previous n - aᵢ. Eggleton, Erdős, and Selfridge proved aₖ < k^{2+o(1)} and conjectured aₖ ≪ k log k.",
    "problemStatement": "Let a₀ = 0, a₁ = 1, and aₖ the least integer > aₖ₋₁ with gcd(n - aₖ, n - aᵢ) = 1 for all i < k. Does Σ_{0 < aᵢ < n} 1/aᵢ → ∞ as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define greedyCoprimeSieve axiomatically, then sieveReciprocalSum as the reciprocal sum. ErdosProblem460 states divergence. Known growth bounds (Eggleton–Erdős–Selfridge) and the least-prime-factor sufficient condition are axiomatized. Restricted sums splitting by small vs large prime divisors are also formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The greedy sieve selects elements whose shifted values n - aₖ are pairwise coprime",
      "Eggleton–Erdős–Selfridge: aₖ < k^{2+o(1)}, conjectured aₖ ≪ k log k",
      "A sufficient condition involves the least prime factor filtered sum f(n)",
      "Erdős asked about divergence of both the small-prime and large-prime restricted sums"
