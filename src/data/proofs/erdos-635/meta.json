  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #635 originates from a letter to Ruzsa around 1980. It asks about the maximum size of subsets of {1,...,N} satisfying a non-divisibility condition on differences. For t=1, the answer is ⌊(N+1)/2⌋ (odd numbers). For t=2, Erdős showed one can exceed N/2 by c·log(N). References: [Gu83], [Ru99].",
    "problemStatement": "For t ≥ 1 and A ⊆ {1,...,N}, suppose that whenever a, b ∈ A with b - a ≥ t, we have (b-a) ∤ b. How large can |A| be? Is |A| ≤ (1/2 + o_t(1))N? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsNonDivisible, IsAdmissible, and the extremal function f(N,t). The t=1 case (odd numbers) and t=2 construction are axiomatized. The main conjecture is formalized as density approaching 1/2.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The condition b-a ≥ t and (b-a) ∤ b restricts which pairs can coexist in A",
      "For t=1, odd numbers are optimal: any difference from an odd number has an even factor",
      "For t=2, Erdős beats N/2 by c·log(N) using odd numbers plus certain powers of 2",
      "The conjecture says the density is always close to 1/2 regardless of t",
      "Connected to divisibility restrictions in combinatorial number theory"
