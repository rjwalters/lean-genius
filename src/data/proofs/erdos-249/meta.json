  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdos posed this problem in his work with Graham [ErGr80, p.61] and revisited it in [Er88c, p.102]. It belongs to a family of problems asking whether specific arithmetic sums are irrational.\n\nEuler's totient function φ(n) counts integers 1 to n coprime to n. The series ∑ φ(n)/2^n converges rapidly since φ(n) ≤ n and n/2^n → 0.\n\nThe decimal expansion is OEIS A256936, approximately 1.3240...",

    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Series Definition:** termFn(n) = φ(n)/2^n and totientPowerSum = ∑ termFn(n)\n\n2. **Basic Properties:** Non-negativity, small term values\n\n3. **Convergence:** Axiomatized summability (comparison with ∑ n/2^n)\n\n4. **Bounds:** 0 < sum ≤ 2\n\n5. **Main Conjecture:** erdos_249 := Irrational totientPowerSum",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Convergence:** |φ(n)/2^n| ≤ n/2^n → 0, so the series converges absolutely",
      "**First terms:** φ(1)/2 + φ(2)/4 = 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4",
