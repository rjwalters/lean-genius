    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1079** asks about local density in globally dense graphs.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1975:** Erdős poses the question, noting it would be a 'nice generalisation of Turán's theorem'\n- **1981:** Bollobás and Thomason prove the conjecture: YES, except for Turán graphs\n- **1983:** Bondy strengthens the result: the max-degree vertex always works\n\n**Key Insight:** Dense graphs (near Turán threshold) have vertices whose neighborhoods are also dense.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet r ≥ 4. If G is a graph on n vertices with at least ex(n; Kᵣ) edges, must G contain a vertex v with degree d ≫ᵣ n whose neighborhood contains at least ex(d; K_{r-1}) edges?\n\n**Status:** SOLVED\n\n**Answer:** YES, unless G is the Turán graph T(n, r-1) itself.\n\n**Bondy's Strengthening:** If G has > ex(n; Kᵣ) edges, the vertex can be chosen to have maximum degree.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Strategy**\n\n1. **Bollobás-Thomason Approach:** If G has ≥ ex(n; Kᵣ) edges but is not Turán, it has 'extra' edges creating denser local neighborhoods.\n\n2. **Bondy's Extension:** Show the max-degree vertex always satisfies the condition.",
