If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\\mathrm{ex}(n;K_r)$ edges then must $G$ contain a vertex with degree $d\\gg_r n$ whose neighbourhood contains at least $\\mathrm{ex}(d;K_{r-1})$ edges?\n\n\n\nAs Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75} says 'if true this would be a nice generalisation of Tur\\'{a}n's theorem'.\n\nThis is true (unless $G$ it itself the Tur\\'{a}n graph), and was proved by Bollob\\'{a}s and Thomason \\cite{BoTh81}. Bondy \\cite{Bo83b} showed that if $G$ has $>\\mathrm{ex}(n;K_r)$ edges then the corresponding vertex can be chosen to be of maximum degree in $G$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bo83b] Bondy, J.
