    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #608 on edges in 5-cycles. The original conjecture of (2/9)n² edges is FALSE; the correct bound is c = (2 + √2)/16 ≈ 0.2134, determined exactly by Füredi-Maleki (upper) and Grzesik-Hu-Volec (lower).",
    "implications": "The problem reveals that 5-cycles behave differently from longer odd cycles. For C_{2k+1} with k ≥ 3, the bound (2/9)n² IS correct. The special behavior of C₅ connects to algebraic constructions and blow-up techniques.",
