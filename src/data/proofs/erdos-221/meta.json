Ruzsa's construction is ingeniously simple:\\[A = \\{ 5^nm : m\\geq 1\\textrm{ and }5^n\\geq C\\log m\\}+\\{0,1\\}\\]for some small absolute constant $C>0$ (van Doorn explains why $C=(5\\log 2)^{-1}$ works in the comments). That every large integer is of the form $2^k+a$ for some $a\\in A$ is a consequence of the fact that $2$ is a primitive root of $5^n$ for all $n\\geq 1$.\n\nIn \\cite{Ru01} Ruzsa constructs an asymptotically best possible answer to this question (a so-called 'exact additive complement'); that is, there is such a set $A$ with\\[\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\sim \\frac{N}{\\log_2N}\\]as $N\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Lo54] Lorentz, G.
