  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about additive complements to the exponentially sparse set of powers of 2. Lorentz (1954) first showed such complements exist with density O(N log log N / log N). Ruzsa (1972) achieved the optimal bound O(N / log N) with an elegant construction using powers of 5, exploiting the fact that 2 is a primitive root mod 5^n. In 2001, Ruzsa refined this to construct an 'exact' complement with asymptotically optimal density N / log₂ N.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there a set A ⊆ ℕ such that: (1) |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≪ N/log N for all large N, and (2) every large integer can be written as 2^k + a for some k ≥ 0 and a ∈ A?",
    "proofStrategy": "Ruzsa's construction: A = { 5^n · m : m ≥ 1 and 5^n ≥ C log m } + {0, 1} where C = 1/(5 log 2). The key insight is that 2 is a primitive root modulo 5^n for all n ≥ 1, meaning powers of 2 cover all residues coprime to 5^n. This ensures every large integer has the required representation while the constraint 5^n ≥ C log m keeps A sparse.",
