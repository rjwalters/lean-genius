  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1118 (Finite Measure Superlevel Sets)**\n\n**Origins:**\nThis is Problem 2.40 in Hayman's 1974 collection, attributed to Erdős. It concerns entire functions and the measure-theoretic size of regions where |f(z)| is large.\n\n**The Setup:**\n- f: ℂ → ℂ is an entire (everywhere holomorphic) non-constant function\n- E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c} is the superlevel set\n- Question: When does E(c) have finite planar measure?\n\n**Resolution:**\n- Camera (1977, PhD thesis) and Gol'dberg (1979) independently solved Question 1\n- Gol'dberg (1979) answered Question 2 negatively with complete classification",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet f(z) be a non-constant entire function.\n\n**Question 1:** If for some c > 0, the set E(c) = {z : |f(z)| > c} has finite measure, what is the minimum growth rate of f?\n\n**Question 2:** If E(c) has finite measure, must there exist c' < c with E(c') also having finite measure?\n\n**Answers:**\n\n**Q1:** Hayman conjectured that ∫₀^∞ r/(log log M(r)) dr < ∞ characterizes this. Camera and Gol'dberg proved this is correct.\n\n**Q2:** NO. Gol'dberg showed the threshold set T = {c > 0 : |E(c)| < ∞} can be:\n- ∅ (e.g., exp(z))\n- (0, ∞) (e.g., polynomials)\n- [m, ∞) for any m > 0\n- (m, ∞) for any m > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Entire Functions:** Define IsEntire via Differentiable ℂ\n\n2. **Superlevel Sets:** superlevelSet f c = {z : |f(z)| > c}\n\n3. **Measure:** HasFiniteMeasure uses Lebesgue volume\n\n4. **Maximum Modulus:** M(r) = sup_{|z|=r} |f(z)|\n\n5. **Growth Integral:** ∫ r/(log log M(r)) dr\n\n6. **Threshold Set:** T(f) = {c > 0 : E(c) finite}\n\n7. **Camera-Gol'dberg:** Axiomatize growth characterization\n\n8. **Gol'dberg Classification:** All threshold shapes possible",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Growth Rate:** ∫ r/(log log M(r)) dr < ∞ is the exact criterion",
      "**Threshold Gaps:** T(f) need not contain all small c values",
      "**Examples:** exp has T = ∅, polynomials have T = (0,∞)",
      "**Monotonicity:** T is always an upper set (tail of ℝ₊)",
      "**Complete Classification:** All interval types [m,∞), (m,∞), ∅, (0,∞) occur"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1118 asked two questions about entire functions with finite-measure superlevel sets. Camera (1977) and Gol'dberg (1979) proved the growth rate criterion ∫ r/(log log M(r)) dr < ∞. Gol'dberg showed the threshold set T can have various shapes, disproving monotonicity to 0.",
    "implications": "**Complex Analysis Connections**\n\n1. **Nevanlinna Theory:** Growth rates connect to order and type\n\n2. **Value Distribution:** How often f is large in modulus\n\n3. **Maximum Modulus:** Central role of M(r) in characterization\n\n4. **Measure Theory:** Lebesgue measure in complex plane",
