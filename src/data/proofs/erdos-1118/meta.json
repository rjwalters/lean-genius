Hayman conjectured that\\[\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{r}{\\log\\log M(r)}\\mathrm{d}r<\\infty\\]is true, and best possible, where $M(r)=\\max_{\\lvert z\\rvert=r}\\lvert f(z)\\rvert$.\n\nHayman's strong conjecture was proved independently by Camera \\cite{Ca77} and Gol'dberg \\cite{Go79b}.\n\nThe second question was answered in the negative by Gol'dberg \\cite{Go79b}, who proved that if $T=\\{ c>0 : \\lvert E(c)\\rvert <\\infty\\}$ then for any $m>0$ there exist entire functions $f$ such that $T=[m,\\infty)$ or $T=(m,\\infty)$. (It is clear that $T=\\emptyset$ and $T=(0,\\infty)$ are also possible.)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ca77] G.
