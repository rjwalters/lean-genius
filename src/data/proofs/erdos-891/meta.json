    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #891**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős and Selfridge in 1967 [ErSe67, p.430] and connects the distribution of prime factors to the structure of short intervals.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős-Selfridge (1967): Original problem formulation\n- Schinzel: Proved a weaker version using Pólya's theorem on smooth numbers\n- Weisenberg: Showed conditional counterexample with interval length p₁···pₖ - 1\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe primorial p₁···pₖ (product of first k primes) gives natural interval lengths: 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, ...\nThe question asks whether these specific lengths guarantee finding integers with many prime factors.\n\nThe problem remains open even for k = 2, asking whether every interval of 6 consecutive integers (for large n) contains a number with at least 3 prime factors.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $2 = p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \\cdots$ denote the primes and $k \\geq 2$.\n\nIs it true that for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists an integer $m \\in [n, n + p_1 \\cdots p_k)$ with more than $k$ prime factors (counted with multiplicity)?\n\n**Special Cases:**\n- $k = 2$: Does every interval of length 6 (for large n) contain an integer with $\\Omega(m) \\geq 3$?\n- This simplest case remains OPEN.\n\n**Interval lengths:** primorial(2) = 6, primorial(3) = 30, primorial(4) = 210, ...",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Prime Factor Counting:**\n   - bigOmega(n): Total prime factors with multiplicity\n   - littleOmega(n): Distinct prime factors\n\n2. **Prime Enumeration:**\n   - nthPrime(k): The k-th prime (1-indexed)\n   - Axiomatize basic values: p₁ = 2, p₂ = 3, p₃ = 5\n\n3. **Primorial Definition:**\n   - Product of first k primes\n   - Gives interval lengths: 2, 6, 30, 210, ...\n\n4. **Main Conjecture:**\n   - HasManyFactors(n, k): Interval contains m with Ω(m) > k\n   - erdos891_conjecture: Eventually true for all n\n\n5. **Related Results:**\n   - Schinzel's weaker theorem\n   - Weisenberg's conditional counterexample\n   - Connection to smooth numbers",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Primorial Intervals:** The interval length p₁···pₖ is special - it's divisible by all primes ≤ pₖ, creating a natural boundary for the problem",
      "**Ω Function:** Counts prime factors WITH multiplicity. E.g., Ω(8) = Ω(2³) = 3, not 1",
      "**k = 2 Challenge:** Even checking if every interval of 6 integers contains a number with ≥ 3 prime factors is unsolved",
      "**Critical Length:** Weisenberg showed that using p₁···pₖ - 1 instead makes the statement FALSE (conditionally), so the exact primorial length is essential",
      "**Smooth Number Connection:** Pólya's theorem on gaps in k-smooth numbers is key to Schinzel's partial result",
      "**Dickson's Conjecture:** The conditional counterexample relies on this generalization of the twin prime conjecture"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #891 asks whether every interval [n, n + p₁···pₖ) for large n contains an integer with more than k prime factors. The problem is OPEN even for k = 2, which asks about intervals of length 6. Schinzel proved a weaker version with modified interval length, while Weisenberg showed the exact primorial length is critical.",
    "implications": "**Connections and Implications**\n\n1. **Prime Factor Distribution:** Understanding how integers with many prime factors are distributed in short intervals\n\n2. **Smooth Numbers:** Deep connection to the gaps between k-smooth numbers\n\n3. **Dickson's Conjecture:** The conditional counterexample shows unexpected connections to prime constellation problems\n\n4. **Computational Limits:** Even the k = 2 case cannot be resolved by computation alone\n\n5. **Primorial Structure:** The specific choice of interval length p₁···pₖ is mathematically significant, not arbitrary",
