    "historicalContext": "This problem from Erdős-Graham (1980, p.33) asks about representing 1 as a sum of unit fractions with denominators in a short interval. Croot (2001) proved the affirmative answer.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 2. Is it true that there exists an interval I of width (e-1+o(1))k and integers n₁ < ... < nₖ ∈ I such that 1 = 1/n₁ + ... + 1/nₖ?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the main definitions (unit fraction sums, short interval representations) and prove concrete examples for k=3 and k=4. The Erdős-Graham constant (e-1) ≈ 1.718 is shown to be approximately optimal.",
