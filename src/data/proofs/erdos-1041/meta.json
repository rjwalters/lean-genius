  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from the 1958 paper 'Metric properties of polynomials' by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian. They studied the geometry of polynomial level sets—specifically the sublevel set {z : |f(z)| < 1} for monic polynomials with roots in the unit disk.\n\nThe authors proved that this sublevel set always has a connected component containing at least two roots (the Component Lemma). The open problem asks for a quantitative strengthening: can we find not just connectivity, but a SHORT path of length less than 2 connecting two roots?\n\nThe constant 2 is sharp—it's the diameter of the unit disk, so roots could be nearly 2 apart. The conjecture asks whether the sublevel set always provides an efficient shortcut.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(z) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}(z - z_i) \\in \\mathbb{C}[z]$ be a monic polynomial with $|z_i| < 1$ for all $i$.\n\n**Conjecture (OPEN)**: Must there always exist a path of length less than $2$ in the sublevel set\n$$\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |f(z)| < 1\\}$$\nwhich connects two of the roots of $f$?\n\n**Known** (Erdős-Herzog-Piranian 1958): The sublevel set always has a connected component containing at least two roots.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Defining sublevel sets**: `sublevelSet f r = {z : ‖f.eval z‖ < r}`\n\n2. **Defining path length**: Using 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure `μH[1]`\n\n3. **Stating the Component Lemma**: The known 1958 result about connected components\n\n4. **Stating the main conjecture**: Existence of a path of length < 2\n\n5. **Special cases**: The quadratic case as a base case\n\n6. **Properties**: Sublevel sets are open and contain all roots",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Sublevel sets are open**: Since polynomial evaluation is continuous, {z : |f(z)| < 1} is an open set containing all roots.",
      "**Why 2 is the bound**: The diameter of the unit disk is 2, so any two roots are at distance less than 2. The conjecture asks if the sublevel set provides a path achieving this.",
      "**Component vs path**: The Component Lemma guarantees connectivity but not path length. A winding path through the sublevel set could be arbitrarily long.",
      "**Lemniscates**: The level curves {z : |f(z)| = c} are called polynomial lemniscates. They have beautiful geometric properties studied since Bernoulli.",
      "**Quadratic base case**: For degree 2, the straight line segment between roots lies in the sublevel set and has length < 2."

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #1041 about paths in polynomial sublevel sets. The Erdős-Herzog-Piranian Component Lemma (1958) shows that the sublevel set {z : |f(z)| < 1} has a connected component containing at least two roots. The open conjecture asks whether this connected component contains a SHORT path of length less than 2 connecting two roots.",
    "implications": "This problem connects complex analysis, metric geometry, and potential theory. Understanding the geometry of polynomial level sets has applications in numerical analysis (root-finding algorithms) and complex dynamics. The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure provides the natural notion of path length for potentially irregular curves.",
