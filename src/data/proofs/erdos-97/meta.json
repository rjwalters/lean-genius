    "historicalContext": "Erdős originally conjectured (1946) that every convex polygon has a vertex with no other 3 vertices equidistant from it. Danzer disproved this with a 9-point counterexample where every vertex has exactly 3 vertices equidistant from it.\n\nThe problem was then raised for k = 4: does every convex polygon have a vertex with no other 4 vertices equidistant? This remains open.\n\nFishburn and Reeds (1992) found an even stronger example: a convex 20-gon where every vertex has 3 vertices at UNIT distance (not just equidistant at varying radii). They also proved 20 is minimal for this property.",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdős Problem #97 (OPEN for k = 4)**\n\nDoes every convex polygon have a vertex with no other 4 vertices equidistant from it?\n\n**Solved Variants**:\n- k = 3: NO (Danzer's 9-point counterexample)\n- k = 3 unit distance: NO (Fishburn-Reeds 20-point example)\n\n**Open Questions**:\n- The k = 4 case\n- Does any k work?\n\n**Prize**: $100",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the key concepts and counterexamples:\n\n1. **hasKEquidistantAt**: k points at same distance from a vertex\n\n2. **hasKEquidistantProperty**: k-equidistant from every vertex\n\n3. **isConvexPosition**: vertices of a convex polygon\n\n4. **Erdos97Question**: the open k = 4 question\n\n5. **danzerCounterexample** (axiom): 9-point convex with 3-equidistant\n\n6. **fishburnReedsExample** (axiom): 20-point with 3 unit-distance",
