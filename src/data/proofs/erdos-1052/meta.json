    "historicalContext": "A **unitary divisor** d of n satisfies gcd(d, n/d) = 1, meaning d and its complement share no common prime factors. A **unitary perfect number** equals the sum of its proper unitary divisors.\n\nWall (1972) found the fifth unitary perfect number. Only five are known: 6, 60, 90, 87360, and a 24-digit number discovered in 1975. It is conjectured there are only finitely many.\n\nThe evenness result follows from a parity argument: unitary divisors pair up (d ↔ n/d), and odd numbers produce odd divisor counts leading to contradiction.",
    "problemStatement": "**OPEN CONJECTURE**: Are there only finitely many unitary perfect numbers?\n\n**SOLVED**: All unitary perfect numbers are even.\n\nKnown unitary perfect numbers:\n- 6 = 2 · 3\n- 60 = 2² · 3 · 5\n- 90 = 2 · 3² · 5\n- 87360 = 2⁶ · 3 · 5 · 7 · 13\n- 146361946186458562560000 = 2¹⁸ · 3 · 5⁴ · 7 · 11 · 13 · 19 · 37 · 79 · 109 · 157 · 313",
    "proofStrategy": "For the evenness result:\n1. If n is odd and unitary perfect, all its unitary divisors are odd (if d were even, 2 | n)\n2. The sum equals n (odd), so the count of divisors must be odd (sum of odds is odd iff count is odd)\n3. But unitary divisors pair up: d ↔ n/d (since gcd(d, n/d) = 1 implies gcd(n/d, d) = 1)\n4. Pairs contribute even count; the only unpaired element would be √n if n is a perfect square\n5. Detailed analysis shows no odd n can satisfy the parity constraint",
