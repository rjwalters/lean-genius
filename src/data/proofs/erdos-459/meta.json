Estimate $f(u)$.\n\n\n\nAn equivalent definition is that $v$ is the smallest number $>u$ such that all prime factors of $v$ are factors of $u$. In particular, we trivially have\\[u+2\\leq f(u)\\leq u^2.\\]Cambie has noted that when $u=p$ is a prime, $f(p)=p^2$, and if $u$ is even then $f(u)\\leq 2^k$, where $2^k$ is the smallest power of $2$ which is $>u$. In particular, $f(u)=u+2$ whenever $u=2^k-2$ for $k\\geq 2$.\n\nIn particular the function $f(u)$ does not exhibit any regular growth, since there are infinitely many $u$ such that $f(u)=u+2$ and infinitely many $u$ such that $f(u)=u^2$. Cambie can also show that $f(n)=(1+o(1))n$ for almost all $n$. It is not clear what kind of estimates Erd\\H{o}s and Graham had in mind. Since Cambie's observations seem to settle the most obvious questions, I will mark this as solved.\n\n\n\nBack to the problem",
