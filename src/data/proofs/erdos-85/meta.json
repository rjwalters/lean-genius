Is it true that, for all large $n$, $f(n+1)\\geq f(n)$?\n\n\n\nThe function $f(n)$ is a reformulation of the Ramsey number $R(C_4,K_{1,n})$, in that\\[R(C_4,K_{1,n})=\\min\\{ m : f(m)\\leq m-n\\}\\]and\\[f(n)=\\min\\{ m : m\\geq R(C_4, K_{1,n-m})\\}.\\]The behaviour of this Ramsey number more generally is [552].\n\nA weaker version of the conjecture asks for some constant $c$ such that $f(m)>f(n)-c$ for all $m>n$. This question can be asked for other graphs than $C_4$.\n\nThe bounds in [552] imply in particular that $f(n)<\\sqrt{n}+1$ and\\[f(n)=(1+o(1))\\sqrt{n}.\\]It is easy to check that $f(4)=2$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
