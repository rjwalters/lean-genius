    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Stein conjectured f(N) = o(N), proved by Erdős-Szemerédi in 1968. Subsequent work by Croot (2003), Chen (2005), and de la Bretèche-Ford-Vandehey (2013) refined the bounds. The function L(N) = exp(√(log N · log log N)) plays a central role.",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #202 on disjoint covering systems. While the Erdős-Stein conjecture f(N) = o(N) is proved, the exact asymptotics remain open. The gap between L(N)^{1+o(1)} and L(N)^{√3/2+o(1)} in the exponent is the main open question.",
