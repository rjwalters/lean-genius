The difference $a_{2n+1}-2a_{2n-1}$ is the $n$th digit in the binary expansion of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFind similar results for $\\theta=\\sqrt{m}$, and other algebraic numbers.\n\n\n\nThe result for $\\sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Graham and Pollak \\cite{GrPo70}. The problem statement is open-ended, but presumably Erd\\H{o}s and Graham would have been satisfied with the wide-ranging generalisations of Stoll (\\cite{St05} and \\cite{St06}).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GrPo70] Graham, R.
