What is the order of growth of $1_A^{(k)}(n)$, i.e. the number of representations of $n$ as the sum of $k$ many $k$th powers? Does there exist some $c>0$ and infinitely many $n$ such that\\[1_A^{(k)}(n) >n^c?\\]\n\n\n\nConnected to Waring's problem. The famous Hypothesis $K$ of Hardy and Littlewood was that $1_A^{(k)}(n)\\leq n^{o(1)}$, but this was disproved by Mahler \\cite{Ma36} for $k=3$, who constructed infinitely many $n$ such that\\[1_A^{(3)}(n)\\gg n^{1/12}\\](where $A$ is the set of cubes). Erd\\H{o}s believed Hypothesis $K$ fails for all $k\\geq 4$, but this is unknown. Hardy and Littlewood made the weaker Hypothesis $K^*$ that for all $N$ and $\\epsilon>0$\\[\\sum_{n\\leq N}1_A^{(k)}(n)^2 \\ll_\\epsilon N^{1+\\epsilon}.\\]Erd\\H{o}s and Graham remark: 'This is probably true but no doubt very deep. However, it would suffice for most applications.'\n\nIndependently Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er36} and Chowla proved that for all $k\\geq 3$ and infinitely many $n$\\[1_A^{(k)}(n) \\gg n^{c/\\log\\log n}\\]for some constant $c>0$ (depending on $k$). In \\cite{Er65b} Erd\\H{o}s claims an unpublished proof that, if $B$ is the set of $k$th powers of any set of positive density, then\\[\\limsup 1_B^{(k)}(n)=\\infty.\\]This is discussed in problem D4 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er36] Erd\\\"{o}s, Paul, On the Representation of an Integer as the Sum of k k-th\nPowers.
