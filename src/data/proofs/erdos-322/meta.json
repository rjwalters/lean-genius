    "historicalContext": "This problem connects to the classical theory of Waring's problem and the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. Hardy and Littlewood conjectured Hypothesis K: that r_k(n) = n^{o(1)} for k ≥ 3, meaning representations grow slower than any polynomial.\n\nMahler (1936) sensationally disproved this for cubes, showing r_3(n) ≫ n^{1/12} for infinitely many n. Erdős believed Hypothesis K fails for all k ≥ 4, but this remains open. Independently, Erdős and Chowla proved a weaker bound r_k(n) ≫ n^{c/log log n} for all k ≥ 3.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (PARTIALLY SOLVED)**\n\nLet k ≥ 3 and let r_k(n) be the number of representations of n as a sum of k many k-th powers.\n\n**Question:** Does there exist c > 0 with r_k(n) > n^c for infinitely many n?\n\n**Results:**\n- k = 3: YES, c = 1/12 works (Mahler 1936)\n- k ≥ 4: OPEN (Erdős conjectured YES)\n- Weaker: r_k(n) ≫ n^{c/log log n} for all k ≥ 3 (Erdős-Chowla)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the representation count r_k(n) and formalizes Hypothesis K and its negation. Mahler's theorem is axiomatized for k = 3. The Erdős-Chowla bound gives a weaker lower bound valid for all k. We also formalize Hypothesis K* (squared sum bound) which is probably true but unproven.",
