  "description": "For bases 3 ≤ d₁ < ... < dᵣ with Σ1/(dᵢ-1) ≥ 1, can all large integers be written as Σcᵢaᵢ with cᵢ ∈ {0,1} and aᵢ having only digits {0,1} in base dᵢ? Q1 PROVED. Q2 open (proved for {3,4,7}).",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Burr, Erdős, Graham, and Li (1996) conjectured that digit-restricted numbers in multiple bases form complete sequences when a reciprocal condition is satisfied. The first question was proved and formalized in Lean. The second question (with gcd and level-k digits) remains open in general.",
    "problemStatement": "For integers 3 ≤ d₁ < ... < dᵣ with Σ 1/(dᵢ-1) ≥ 1, can all sufficiently large integers be represented as Σ cᵢaᵢ where cᵢ ∈ {0,1} and aᵢ uses only digits {0,1} in base dᵢ?",
    "proofStrategy": "Full rewrite from formal-conjectures. Defines digit-restricted numbers, the reciprocal condition, and representation properties. States Pomerance's necessity result, the proved first question, and the open second question with the {3,4,7} verification.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The reciprocal condition Σ 1/(dᵢ-1) ≥ 1 is both necessary and sufficient for Q1",
      "Numbers with digits {0,1} in base d are sums of distinct powers of d",
      "The gcd condition in Q2 prevents trivial obstructions from common factors",
      "The {3,4,7} case verification shows Σ 1/(dᵢ-1) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1 exactly"
