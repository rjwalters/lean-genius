Friedman and Pippenger \\cite{FrPi87} proved this when $G$ is a tree. Haxell, Kohayakawa, and Luczak \\cite{HKL95} proved this when $G$ is a cycle. An alternative proof when $G$ is a cycle (with better constants) was given by Javadi, Khoeini, Omidi, and Pokrovskiy \\cite{JKOP19}.\n\nThis was disproved for $d=3$ by R\\\"{o}dl and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{RoSz00}, who constructed a graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $3$ such that\\[\\hat{R}(G)\\gg n(\\log n)^{c}\\]for some absolute constant $c>0$. Tikhomirov \\cite{Ti22b} has improved this to\\[\\hat{R}(G)\\gg n\\exp(c\\sqrt{\\log n}).\\]It is an interesting question how large $\\hat{R}(G)$ can be if $G$ has maximum degree $3$. Kohayakawa, R\\\"{o}dl, Schacht, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{KRSS11} proved an upper bound of $\\leq n^{5/3+o(1)}$ and Conlon, Nenadov, and Truji\\'{c} \\cite{CNT22} proved $\\ll n^{8/5}$. The best known upper bound of $\\leq n^{3/2+o(1)}$ is due to Dragani\\'{c} and Petrova \\cite{DrPe22}.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Be83b] Beck, J\\'{o}zsef, On size Ramsey number of paths, trees, and circuits.
