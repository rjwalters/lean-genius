  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The formula for 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 is famously attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who allegedly discovered it as a schoolboy around 1785. The story goes that when his teacher asked the class to sum the numbers 1 to 100 (hoping for a quiet classroom), young Gauss immediately answered 5050.\n\nGauss realized that pairing 1+100, 2+99, 3+98, etc. gives 50 pairs, each summing to 101, yielding 50 x 101 = 5050. This pairing argument is the essence of the proof.\n\nWhile this anecdote may be apocryphal, the formula was known to the ancient Greeks and appears in works by Archimedes. It also appears in Babylonian mathematics and was studied extensively by Indian mathematicians.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Gauss, ~1785)**: The sum of the first n natural numbers:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{n} k = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\nMore generally, for an arithmetic series with first term a and common difference d:\n\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (a + kd) = na + \\frac{dn(n-1)}{2}$$\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #68.",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Pairing Argument (Gauss's Method):**\n\nWrite the sum S twice, forwards and backwards:\n\n```\n  S = 1   +   2   +   3   + ... + (n-1) +   n\n  S = n   + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... +   2   +   1\n ─────────────────────────────────────────────\n 2S = (n+1) + (n+1) + (n+1) + ... + (n+1) + (n+1)\n    = n x (n+1)\n```\n\nTherefore S = n(n+1)/2.\n\nThe formalization uses Mathlib's `Finset.sum_range_id` and derives the classical formula by adjusting indices.",

    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance:**\n\n**1. Foundation for series**\nThis formula is often the first example of summing an infinite series and motivates more advanced techniques.\n\n**2. Triangular numbers**\nThese arise naturally in combinatorics as binomial coefficients: T(n) = C(n+1, 2).\n\n**3. Induction template**\nThe proof by pairing (or induction) serves as a template for proving many similar identities.\n\n**Practical Applications:**\n\nThe formula appears in algorithm analysis (summing loop iterations), probability theory, and physics (potential energy in springs, summing forces).",
