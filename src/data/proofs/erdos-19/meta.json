  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture was posed at a party in Boulder, Colorado in September 1972. It became one of the most famous problems in combinatorics, resisting proof for nearly 50 years until Kang, Kelly, Kühn, Methuku, and Osthus resolved it for all sufficiently large n in 2021.",
    "problemStatement": "If $G$ is an edge-disjoint union of $n$ copies of $K_n$ (the complete graph on $n$ vertices), then $\\chi(G) = n$.",
    "proofStrategy": "The 2021 proof uses the absorbing method: (1) construct a small absorbing structure that can incorporate leftover vertices, (2) greedily color most vertices, (3) use absorption to handle the remainder. Kahn's earlier asymptotic result χ(G) ≤ (1+o(1))n earned the $100 consolation prize.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Lower bound χ(G) ≥ n is easy: each K_n clique requires n colors",
      "Upper bound χ(G) ≤ n is the hard part requiring global coordination",
      "Equivalent to: linear hypergraphs have chromatic index ≤ n",
      "Equivalent to: nearly disjoint sets admit rainbow partitions",
      "The absorbing method handles irregular configurations"

    "summary": "The Erdős-Faber-Lovász Conjecture, posed in 1972, was resolved for all sufficiently large n in 2021 using the absorbing method. Combined with Hindman's verification of small cases, the conjecture is now fully proven: every edge-disjoint union of n copies of K_n is n-colorable.",
    "implications": "The resolution demonstrates the power of the absorbing method in extremal combinatorics and settles a 50-year-old question about graph coloring and hypergraph chromatic indices.",
