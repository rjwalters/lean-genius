    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #994 (Khintchine's Equidistribution Conjecture)**\n\n**Origin:**\nKhintchine (1923) conjectured that for almost all real α, the sequence {kα} (fractional parts) is equidistributed in EVERY measurable set E ⊆ (0,1).\n\n**Weyl's Theorem (True):**\nFor any FIXED measurable E, for almost all α, equidistribution holds. The exceptional set depends on E.\n\n**Khintchine's Conjecture (False):**\nCan the exceptional set be made independent of E? That is: for almost all α, does equidistribution hold for ALL E simultaneously?\n\n**Marstrand's Disproof (1970):**\nNo! The quantifier exchange fails. For any α, one can construct a 'bad' set E where equidistribution fails.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet E ⊆ (0,1) be measurable with Lebesgue measure λ(E). Is it true that for almost all α:\n\n  lim_{n→∞} (1/n) ∑_{k=1}^n 1_{kα ∈ E} = λ(E)\n\nfor ALL measurable E?\n\n**Answer: NO** (Marstrand 1970)\n\nThe conjecture is FALSE. The quantifiers ∀E and ∀ᵐα cannot be exchanged.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Fractional Parts:** frac, fracSequence for {kα}\n\n2. **Counting:** countInE, empiricalFrequency\n\n3. **Equidistribution:** IsEquidistributed as limit definition\n\n4. **Weyl's Theorem:** weyl_theorem, WeylStatement (true)\n\n5. **Khintchine:** KhintchineConjecture (false)\n\n6. **Quantifier Difference:** WeylOrder (∀E ∀ᵐα) vs KhintchineOrder (∀ᵐα ∀E)\n\n7. **Disproof:** marstrand_disproof, marstrand_construction\n\n8. **Bad Sets:** bad_set_exists — E depends on α",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #994 asks whether Khintchine's equidistribution conjecture is true: for a.e. α, does {kα} equidistribute in ALL measurable E? Marstrand (1970) showed this is FALSE. While Weyl's theorem says for any fixed E, a.e. α works, you cannot exchange quantifiers to get a single exceptional set for all E.",
    "implications": "**Connections**\n\n1. **Weyl's Theorem:** The true statement — equidistribution for fixed sets\n\n2. **Discrepancy Theory:** Measures deviation from equidistribution\n\n3. **Continued Fractions:** Marstrand's construction uses CF expansion of α\n\n4. **Measure Theory:** Uncountably many E causes the failure",

      "What restrictions on E make Khintchine-type statements true?",
