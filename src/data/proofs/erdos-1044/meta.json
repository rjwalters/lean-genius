  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Polynomial Lemniscates and Boundary Lengths**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian in 1958 while studying metric properties of polynomials. Given a monic polynomial f(z) = ∏(z - zᵢ) with all roots in the unit disk, the sublevel set {z : |f(z)| < 1} forms interesting shapes called polynomial lemniscates.\n\nThe question asks for the infimum of the maximum boundary length Λ(f) over all such polynomials.\n\n**Tang's Solution**: The infimum is exactly 2. This value is approached but never achieved by any specific polynomial. The conjectured optimizers for each degree n are the roots-of-unity polynomials z^n - 1.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet f(z) = ∏ᵢ(z - zᵢ) ∈ ℂ[z] where |zᵢ| ≤ 1 for all roots.\n\nDefine Λ(f) as the maximum of the lengths of the boundaries of the connected components of {z : |f(z)| < 1}.\n\nDetermine the infimum of Λ(f) over all such polynomials f.\n\n**Answer**: The infimum is 2.\n\n**Key Properties**:\n- The infimum is not achieved by any polynomial (Λ(f) > 2 for all f)\n- As degree → ∞ with appropriate roots, Λ(f) → 2\n- Conjecture: For fixed degree n, z^n - 1 minimizes Λ(f)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Tang's Approach**\n\n1. **Upper bound (Λ ≥ 2)**: Show that any polynomial's level set boundary has length > 2 using geometric arguments about how the boundary must surround the roots.\n\n2. **Lower bound (inf = 2)**: Construct explicit families of polynomials (roots of unity) whose boundary lengths approach 2.\n\n3. **Geometric insight**: The roots-of-unity polynomial z^n - 1 has n roots uniformly distributed on the unit circle. Its sublevel set forms n small 'petals' that shrink as n → ∞, with total boundary length approaching 2.\n\n**Technical tools**:\n- Complex analysis and potential theory\n- Arc length computation for algebraic curves\n- Topology of sublevel sets",
