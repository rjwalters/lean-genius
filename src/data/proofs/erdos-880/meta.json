Let $B=\\{b_1<b_2<\\cdots\\}$ be the set of integers which are the sum of $k$ or fewer distinct $a\\in A$. Is it true that $b_{n+1}-b_n=O(1)$? (Where the implied constant may depend on both $A$ and $k$.)\n\n\n\nA problem of Burr and Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nHegyv\\'{a}ri, Hennecart, and Plagne \\cite{HHP07} showed the answer is yes for $k=2$ (in fact with $b_{n+1}-b_n\\leq 2$ for large $n$) but no for $k\\geq 3$.\n\nThe proof that $b_{n+1}-b_n\\leq 2$ for $k=2$ is trivial, since clearly all odd numbers in $A+A$ must be the sum of two distinct elements from $A$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[HHP07] Hegyv\\'ari, Norbert and Hennecart, Fran\\c cois and Plagne,\nAlain, Answer to a question by {B}urr and {E}rd\\H{o}s on restricted\naddition, and related results.
