  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Burr and Erdős and concerns the gap structure of restricted additive bases. An additive basis of order k is a set A ⊂ ℕ where every sufficiently large integer can be written as a sum of at most k elements from A. The 'restricted' version k×A only allows sums of distinct elements. The question asks whether gaps in k×A are uniformly bounded. Hegyvári, Hennecart, and Plagne completely resolved this in 2007, finding a surprising dichotomy based on the value of k.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊂ ℕ be an additive basis of order k. Let B = {b₁ < b₂ < ···} be the set of integers which are the sum of k or fewer distinct elements of A. Is it true that b_{n+1} - b_n = O(1)? (Where the implied constant may depend on both A and k.)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines additive bases, restricted sumsets k×A, and the gap boundedness property. The key results are: (1) For k=2, the parity argument shows gaps are at most 2 - since sums a+a are even but 2A ~ ℕ requires odd numbers, which must come from distinct pairs a+b. (2) For k≥3, an explicit counterexample is constructed where kA ~ ℕ but k×A has arbitrarily large gaps.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The answer depends on k: YES for k=2, NO for k≥3",
      "For k=2, parity forces bounded gaps: a+a is always even, so odd numbers need distinct pairs",
      "The gap bound for k=2 is exactly 2 (tight)",
      "For k≥3, counterexamples exist with Δ(k×A) = ∞",
      "The 'distinct elements' constraint fundamentally changes the problem",
      "k×A ⊆ kA, but the restricted set can be much sparser"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #880 is SOLVED with a dichotomous answer. For k=2, the Burr-Erdős question has a positive answer: if 2A ~ ℕ then Δ(2×A) ≤ 2. For k≥3, the answer is negative: there exist bases A with kA ~ ℕ but Δ(k×A) = ∞. This was completely resolved by Hegyvári, Hennecart, and Plagne in 2007.",
    "implications": "This result beautifully illustrates how the 'distinct elements' constraint fundamentally changes the structure of additive problems. The parity argument for k=2 is elegant and elementary, while the k≥3 counterexamples require careful construction. The problem connects to the broader study of restricted addition in additive combinatorics.",

      "What is the growth rate of the maximum gap in k×A for k≥3?",
      "Are there natural conditions on A that ensure bounded gaps for k≥3?",
