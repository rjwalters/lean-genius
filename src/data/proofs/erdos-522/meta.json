Erd\\H{o}s and Offord \\cite{EO56} showed that the number of real roots of a random degree $n$ polynomial with $\\pm 1$ coefficients is $(\\frac{2}{\\pi}+o(1))\\log n$.\n\nThere is some ambiguity whether Erd\\H{o}s intended the coefficients to be in $\\{-1,1\\}$ or $\\{0,1\\}$ - see the comments section.\n\nA weaker version of this was solved by Yakir \\cite{Ya21}, who proved that\\[\\frac{R_n}{n/2}\\to 1\\]in probability. (This weaker claim was also asked by Erd\\H{o}s, and also appears in a book of Hayman \\cite{Ha67}.) More precisely,\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mathbb{P}(\\lvert R_n-n/2\\rvert \\geq n^{9/10}) =0.\\]See also [521].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EO56] Erd\\\"{o}s, Paul and Offord, A.
