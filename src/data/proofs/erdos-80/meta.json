    "historicalContext": "**Books in Dense Triangle Graphs**\n\nA 'book' in graph theory is an edge shared by multiple triangles - like the spine of a book with triangular pages. This problem asks: in a dense graph where every edge participates in at least one triangle, how large must the largest book be?\n\n**The Phase Transition at c = 1/4**: A remarkable phenomenon occurs at edge density 1/4:\n- For c > 1/4: Books of linear size n/6 are guaranteed (Edwards, Khadziivanov-Nikiforov 1979)\n- For c < 1/4: Books can be subpolynomial in size\n\n**Erdős's Conjectures Disproved**: Erdős asked whether f_c(n) > n^ε for some ε > 0. Fox and Loh (2012) disproved this, showing f_c(n) ≤ n^{O(1/log log n)} for c < 1/4.\n\n**The Gap**: Szemerédi's regularity lemma implies f_c(n) → ∞, but the precise growth rate between 'tending to infinity' and the Fox-Loh upper bound remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet c > 0 and define f_c(n) as the maximum m such that every graph G with:\n- n vertices\n- at least cn² edges\n- every edge contained in at least one triangle\n\nmust contain a book of size m (an edge shared by at least m different triangles).\n\n**Questions**:\n1. Estimate f_c(n)\n2. Is f_c(n) > n^ε for some ε > 0? (DISPROVED by Fox-Loh)\n3. Is f_c(n) ≫ log n? (OPEN)\n\n**Current Status**: OPEN - the precise growth rate of f_c(n) for c < 1/4 is unknown.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Known Results**\n\n**Upper Bounds (c < 1/4)**:\n1. Alon-Trotter: f_c(n) ≪ n^{1/2}\n2. Fox-Loh (2012): f_c(n) ≤ n^{O(1/log log n)} - disproves polynomial growth\n\n**Lower Bounds**:\n1. Szemerédi regularity: f_c(n) → ∞ (very slow, tower-type growth)\n2. For c > 1/4: f_c(n) ≥ n/6 (Edwards, Khadziivanov-Nikiforov)\n\n**The Gap**: Lower bounds from regularity are 'very poor' - the true growth rate for c < 1/4 lies somewhere between 'tending to infinity' and n^{o(1)}.\n\n**Key Techniques**:\n- Szemerédi regularity lemma for lower bounds\n- Probabilistic constructions for upper bounds\n- Algebraic constructions (Alon-Trotter)",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #80 asks for the growth rate of the largest book (edge in many triangles) in dense triangle-saturated graphs.
