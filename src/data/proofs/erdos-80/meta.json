In particular, is it true that $f_c(n)>n^{\\epsilon}$ for some $\\epsilon>0$? Or $f_c(n)\\gg \\log n$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Rothschild. Alon and Trotter showed that, provided $c<1/4$, $f_c(n)\\ll_c n^{1/2}$. Szemer\\'{e}di observed that his regularity lemma implies that $f_c(n)\\to \\infty$.\n\nEdwards (unpublished) and Khadziivanov and Nikiforov \\cite{KhNi79} proved independently that $f_c(n) \\geq n/6$ when $c>1/4$ (see [905]).\n\nFox and Loh \\cite{FoLo12} proved that\\[f_c(n) \\leq n^{O(1/\\log\\log n)}\\]for all $c<1/4$, disproving the first conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nThe best known lower bounds for $f_c(n)$ are those from Szemer\\'{e}di's regularity lemma, and as such remain very poor.\n\nSee also [600] and the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FoLo12] Fox, Jacob and Loh, Po-Shen, On a problem of Erd\\H{o}s and {R}othschild on edges in\ntriangles.
