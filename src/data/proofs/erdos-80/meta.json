    "summary": "Erdos Problem #80 asks for the growth rate of the largest book in dense triangle-saturated graphs. Fox and Loh (2012) disproved the polynomial growth conjecture, showing f_c(n) <= n^{O(1/log log n)} for c < 1/4. The problem remains OPEN: the true growth rate between regularity-based lower bounds and the Fox-Loh upper bound is unknown.",
    "implications": "**Graph-Theoretic Significance**\n\n1. **Regularity Limitations:** Exposes the weakness of regularity-based bounds\n\n2. **Phase Transitions:** The c = 1/4 threshold is a sharp structural transition\n\n3. **Triangle Structure:** Connects global density to local triangle configurations\n\n4. **Extremal Combinatorics:** Open gap challenges current proof techniques",

      "What is the true growth rate of f_c(n) for c < 1/4?",
