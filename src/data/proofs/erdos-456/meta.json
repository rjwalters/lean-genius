  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős compared two natural arithmetic functions of n: the smallest prime in the arithmetic progression 1 mod n, and the smallest integer whose totient is divisible by n. While mₙ ≤ pₙ trivially, Erdős conjectured the gap is typically large and explored when equality occurs.",
    "problemStatement": "Three questions: (1) Is mₙ < pₙ for almost all n? (2) Does pₙ/mₙ → ∞ for almost all n? (3) Are there infinitely many primes p such that p−1 is the only n with mₙ = p?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize the Euler totient, the functions pₙ and mₙ with their defining properties. Known results (mₙ ≤ pₙ, Linnik's bound, Erdős's infinitude result, van Doorn's observation) are recorded. The three conjectures are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "mₙ ≤ pₙ always holds since φ(pₙ) = pₙ − 1 is divisible by n",
      "Linnik's theorem bounds pₙ polynomially in n",

      "Van Doorn showed mₙ ≤ 2n for n = 2^{2k+1}, giving explicit strict inequality"
