    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #423 from [Er77c, p.71] defines a greedy sequence where each new term must be a sum of at least two consecutive earlier terms. Credited to Hofstadter's inspiration from a similar Ulam-type question. Recent progress by Bolan and Tang (2024-2025) shows the excess a(n)-n is nondecreasing and unbounded, and infinitely many integers are missing from the sequence. OEIS A005243.",
    "problemStatement": "Let a₁=1, a₂=2. For k≥3, aₖ is the least integer > a_{k-1} which is the sum of at least two consecutive terms a_i + a_{i+1} + ... + a_j for some i ≤ j < k. What is the asymptotic behaviour of this sequence? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the sequence (noncomputable), the consecutive sum property, initial values, growth properties (excess nondecreasing and unbounded), missing numbers (infinitely many), and asymptotic questions (convergence of a(n)/n, density). The known results theorem erdos_423_known is proved from axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Each term is the smallest integer exceeding the previous that equals a sum of consecutive earlier terms",
      "The sequence grows strictly faster than linearly: a(n) - n is unbounded (Bolan, Tang)",
      "Infinitely many integers are missing, with 4 being the first",
      "The asymptotic growth rate and density of the sequence are unknown",
