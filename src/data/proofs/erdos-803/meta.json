(See [1077].)\n\nAlon \\cite{Al08} proved this is false: for every $D>1$ and large $n$ there is a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $\\geq n\\log n$ edges such that if $H$ is a $D$-balanced subgraph then $H$ has $\\ll m\\sqrt{\\log m}+\\log D$ many edges.\n\nJanzer and Sudakov \\cite{JaSu23} have proved that, for any $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then any graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n\\log n$ edges contains a $O(1)$-balanced subgraph on $m\\geq k$ vertices with\\[\\gg_k \\frac{\\sqrt{\\log m}}{(\\log\\log m)^{3/2}}m\\]many edges.\n\nSee also [1077].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al08] Alon, Noga, Problems and results in extremal combinatorics. {II}.
