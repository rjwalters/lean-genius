    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #884 from [Er98] asks about the relationship between two sums over divisor gaps. Given the divisors d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_t of n, the all-pairs sum (over all i < j) is compared with the consecutive-pairs sum. Related to Problem #144 on divisor arithmetic.",
    "problemStatement": "Let d_1 < d_2 < ... < d_t be the divisors of n. Is there an absolute constant C such that Σ_{i<j} 1/(d_j - d_i) ≤ C(1 + Σ_i 1/(d_{i+1} - d_i))? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines divisorList (sorted divisors), consecutiveGap, generalGap, allPairsSum, and consecutivePairsSum. The conjecture ErdosConjecture884 is axiomatized. Structural lemmas (gap bounds, multiplicativity of τ) and examples (prime case equality, n=6) are axiomatized. Proved: consecutivePairsSum_num_terms (simp), erdos_884_statement (rfl).",

      "All-pairs sum has O(τ²) terms; consecutive-pairs sum has O(τ) terms",
      "For primes, both sums equal 1/(p-1) — conjecture holds trivially",
      "d_j - d_i is a sum of consecutive gaps (telescoping), so general gaps are larger",
      "Multiplicative structure: τ(mn) = τ(m)τ(n) for coprime m,n affects gap patterns",
