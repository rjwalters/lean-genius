    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Purdy posed this problem in combinatorial geometry. Erdős conjectured h_c(n) ≫ √n, but Zach Hunter disproved this using lattice point configurations, showing h_c(n) can be much smaller.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the rich-line counting, maximum collinear number, and state the divergence question. Known upper/lower bounds and Hunter's counterexample are recorded.",

      "Erdős conjectured h_c(n) ≫ √n, disproved by Hunter",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #102 asks to estimate h_c(n), the maximum collinear count when cn² rich lines exist. The √n upper bound holds, but the conjectured √n lower bound was disproved by Hunter. Whether h_c(n) → ∞ remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would complement Problem #101 and advance our understanding of collinearity patterns in point configurations.",

      "Does h_c(n) → ∞ for fixed c > 0?",
