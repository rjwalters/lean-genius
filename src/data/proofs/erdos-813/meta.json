    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #813** is a Ramsey-type problem relating local triangle density to global clique structure.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős-Hajnal:** Established original bounds n^{1/3} ≪ h(n) ≪ n^{1/2}\n- **Bucić-Sudakov (2023):** Improved lower bound to h(n) ≫ n^{5/12-o(1)}\n\n**Key Insight:** The condition \"every 7-vertex set contains a triangle\" is significant because R(3,3) = 6, meaning every 6-coloring has a monochromatic triangle or independent triple. The number 7 pushes beyond this Ramsey threshold.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $h(n)$ be minimal such that every graph on $n$ vertices where every set of 7 vertices contains a triangle must contain a clique of size at least $h(n)$.\n\n**Question:** Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, do constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$ exist such that:\n$$n^{1/3+c_1} \\ll h(n) \\ll n^{1/2-c_2}?$$\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Original (Erdős-Hajnal): $n^{1/3} \\ll h(n) \\ll n^{1/2}$\n- Improved (Bucić-Sudakov 2023): $h(n) \\gg n^{5/12-o(1)}$\n\n**Current Gap:** Exponent between 5/12 ≈ 0.417 and 1/2 = 0.5",
