  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Joseph Wolstenholme proved this theorem in 1862, strengthening an earlier result by Charles Babbage (1819) who showed the congruence holds modulo p^2 for primes p >= 3.\n\nThe theorem reveals deep connections between binomial coefficients and harmonic numbers. It's equivalent to saying the numerator of H_{p-1} = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/(p-1) is divisible by p^2.\n\nWolstenholme primes (where the congruence holds mod p^4) are extremely rare: only 16843 and 2124679 are known.",
    "problemStatement": "**Wolstenholme's Theorem (1862)**: For any prime p >= 5:\n$$\\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^3}$$\n\n**Babbage's Theorem (1819)**: For any prime p >= 3:\n$$\\binom{2p-1}{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p^2}$$\n\nThe central binomial coefficient C(2p-1, p-1) exhibits remarkable divisibility properties.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization provides:\n\n1. **Computational verification** for p = 5, 7, 11, 13 using `native_decide`\n2. **Failure cases** showing p = 2, 3 don't satisfy Wolstenholme (though p = 3 satisfies Babbage)\n3. **Axiom statement** for the full theorem (proof requires harmonic sum analysis)\n\nThe full proof would require showing that the numerator of H_{p-1} is divisible by p^2 for p >= 5.",

    "summary": "This formalization provides computational verification of Wolstenholme's theorem for small primes, demonstrates the necessity of the p >= 5 bound, and establishes the framework for Wolstenholme primes.\n\nThe full analytic proof (involving harmonic sum divisibility) is stated as an axiom, as it requires number-theoretic machinery beyond current Mathlib.",
