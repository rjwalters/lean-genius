R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{Ro77} has proved the $r=4$ case (see [923]). The infinite version (whether every graph of infinite chromatic number contains a subgraph of infinite chromatic number whose girth is $>k$) is also open.\n\nIn \\cite{Er79b} Erd\\H{o}s also asks whether\\[\\lim_{k\\to \\infty}\\frac{f(k,r+1)}{f(k,r)}=\\infty.\\]See also the entry in the graphs problem collection and [740] for the infinitary version.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er79b] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Problems and results in graph theory and combinatorial analysis.
