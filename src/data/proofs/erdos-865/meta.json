Taking all integers in $[N/8,N/4]$ and $[N/2,N]$ shows that $\\frac{5}{8}$ would be best possible here.\n\nIt is a classical folklore fact that if $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,2N\\}$ has size $\\geq N+2$ then there are distinct $a,b\\in A$ such that $a+b\\in A$, which establishes the $k=2$ case.\n\nIn general, one can define $f_k(N)$ to be minimal such that if $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ has size at least $f_k(N)$ then there are $k$ distinct $a_i\\in A$ such that all $\\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise sums are elements of $A$. Erd\\H{o}s and S\\'{o}s conjectured that\\[f_k(N)\\sim \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\sum_{1\\leq r\\leq k-2}\\frac{1}{4^r}\\right) N,\\]and a similar example shows that this would be best possible.\n\nChoi, Erd\\H{o}s, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{CES75} have proved that, for all $k\\geq 3$, there exists $\\epsilon_k>0$ such that (for large enough $N$)\\[f_k(N)\\leq \\left(\\frac{2}{3}-\\epsilon_k\\right)N.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CES75] Choi, S.
