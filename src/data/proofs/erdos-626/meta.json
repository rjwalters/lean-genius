  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem explores the fundamental tension between chromatic number and girth in graph theory. Erdős's seminal 1959 result showed that graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number and girth exist, disproving the intuition that high chromatic number requires short cycles.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- 1959: Erdős proved high-χ, high-girth graphs exist (probabilistic method)\n- Later: Kostochka established lower bound on g_k(n)\n- Erdős provided upper bound construction\n- The limit question remains OPEN\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: g_k(n) ≥ (1/(4 log k)) · log n\n- Upper: g_k(n) ≤ (2/log(k-2)) · log n + 1",
    "problemStatement": "**Setup:** Let k ≥ 4. Define g_k(n) as the largest m such that there exists an n-vertex graph with chromatic number exactly k and girth > m.\n\n**Question:** Does lim_{n→∞} g_k(n) / log n exist?\n\n**Status:** OPEN\n- Both g_k(n) and log n grow, but is the ratio convergent?\n- If the limit exists, it lies between 1/(4 log k) and 2/log(k-2)\n- The gap factor is approximately 8 · log k / log(k-2)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines chromatic number and girth for graphs\n2. Defines g_k(n) as a supremum over graphs\n3. States Kostochka's lower bound as an axiom\n4. States Erdős's upper bound as an axiom\n5. Defines the ratio g_k(n)/log n and limit existence\n6. Analyzes the gap between bounds\n7. Introduces dual function h^(m)(n)\n8.

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #626 is OPEN. We know g_k(n) = Θ(log n) with explicit bounds, but whether the ratio g_k(n)/log n converges as n → ∞ remains unknown. The gap between Kostochka's lower bound and Erdős's upper bound is a factor of approximately 8·log k/log(k-2), which approaches 8 as k → ∞.",
