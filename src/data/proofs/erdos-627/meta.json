    "historicalContext": "This problem explores how far chromatic number can exceed clique number. While ω(G) ≤ χ(G) always, the gap can be arbitrarily large.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- Tutte and Zykov independently showed ω=2 graphs can have arbitrarily large χ\n- Erdős established f(n) ≍ n/(log n)²\n- The Mycielski construction (1955) gives explicit examples\n- Lovász's proof of Kneser graph chromatic number (1978) provides another construction\n- Strong Perfect Graph Theorem (2006) characterizes χ = ω graphs\n\n**Key insight:** Triangle-free graphs can require arbitrarily many colors!",

    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines clique number ω(G) and chromatic number χ(G)\n2. Defines the ratio χ/ω and proves it's ≥ 1\n3. Defines f(n) as the supremum of ratios\n4. States Tutte-Zykov construction showing f(n) → ∞\n5. States Erdős's asymptotic bounds\n6. Formalizes limit existence and potential bounds\n7. Connects to perfect graphs (χ = ω always)\n8.
