    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #287: Egyptian Fraction Gap**\n\nThis problem explores the gap structure of Egyptian fraction representations of 1. Erdős asked whether every such representation must have a 'large' gap.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- **1932:** Erdős proved 1 is not the sum of consecutive integer reciprocals\n- This implies gap ≥ 2 in any representation\n- The optimal example 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 has max gap = 3\n- The gap ≥ 3 conjecture remains OPEN\n\n**Connection to Primes:**\nThe conjecture would follow for all but finitely many cases if for all large N, there exists a prime p ∈ [N, 2N] with (p+1)/2 also prime.",
