Is it true that, for any distinct integers $1<n_1<\\cdots <n_k$ such that\\[1=\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n_k}\\]we must have $\\max(n_{i+1}-n_i)\\geq 3$?\n\n\n\nThe example $1=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{6}$ shows that $3$ would be best possible here. The lower bound of $\\geq 2$ is equivalent to saying that $1$ is not the sum of reciprocals of consecutive integers, proved by Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er32}.\n\nThis conjecture would follow for all but at most finitely many exceptions if it were known that, for all large $N$, there exists a prime $p\\in [N,2N]$ such that $\\frac{p+1}{2}$ is also prime.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er32] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Egy K\\\"{u}rschak-f\\'{e}le elemi sz\\'{a}melm\\'{e}ti t\\'{e}tel \\'{a}ltad\\'{a}nosit\\'{a}sa.
