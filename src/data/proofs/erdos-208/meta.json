  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns gaps between consecutive squarefree numbers (integers not divisible by any perfect square > 1). The sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, ... has density 6/π² ≈ 0.608 in the natural numbers, so 'typical' gaps are small.\n\nErdős posed two questions about how large gaps can be. The first asks whether gaps are always subpolynomial: s_{n+1} - sₙ ≪ sₙ^ε for any ε > 0. The second asks for a precise bound: s_{n+1} - sₙ ≤ (1 + o(1)) · (π²/6) · log(sₙ)/log(log(sₙ)).\n\nErdős himself (1951) proved this second bound would be optimal if true - infinitely many gaps achieve it as a lower bound. The best unconditional upper bound has improved from s_n^{1/5+o(1)} (Filaseta-Trifonov 1992) to s_n^{1/5-c} (Pandey 2024). Granville (1998) showed the first question follows from the ABC conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question 1**: Is it true that for any $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $n$,\n$$s_{n+1} - s_n \\ll_\\epsilon s_n^\\epsilon$$\n\n**Question 2**: Is it true that\n$$s_{n+1} - s_n \\leq (1 + o(1)) \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^2}{6} \\cdot \\frac{\\log s_n}{\\log\\log s_n}$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Best known upper bound**: $s_{n+1} - s_n \\ll s_n^{1/5-c}$ for some $c > 0$ (Pandey 2024)\n\n**Conditional result**: Question 1 follows from the ABC conjecture (Granville 1998)",
    "proofStrategy": "Since both questions are open, we formalize:\n\n1. **The squarefree sequence**: Using Mathlib's `Squarefree` and `Nat.nth`\n2. **The two main conjectures**: As definitions of Props using big-O notation\n3. **Known bounds**: Axiomatize Filaseta-Trifonov and Pandey results\n4. **Lower bound**: Axiomatize Erdős's 1951 result showing optimality of Q2's bound\n5. **Conditional result**: Axiomatize that ABC implies Q1\n6. **Density result**: Axiomatize that squarefree numbers have density 6/π²\n7. **Verified examples**: Small squarefree tests using native_decide",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #208 about gaps between consecutive squarefree numbers. Both questions remain open: whether gaps are always subpolynomial (Question 1), and whether they satisfy a precise log/log-log bound (Question 2). We axiomatize the known partial results including the best unconditional bound (Pandey 2024) and the ABC-conditional result (Granville 1998).",
    "implications": "This problem connects to fundamental questions about the distribution of squarefree numbers and the structure of integers. The connection to ABC conjecture suggests deep arithmetic content. Progress on this problem would improve our understanding of how 'random' the distribution of squarefree numbers is at various scales.",
