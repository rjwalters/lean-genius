Is it true that, for any $\\epsilon>0$ and large $n$,\\[s_{n+1}-s_n \\ll_\\epsilon s_n^{\\epsilon}?\\]Is it true that\\[s_{n+1}-s_n \\leq (1+o(1))\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\frac{\\log s_n}{\\log\\log s_n}?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er51} showed that there are infinitely many $n$ such that\\[s_{n+1}-s_n > (1+o(1))\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\frac{\\log s_n}{\\log\\log s_n},\\]so this bound would be the best possible.\n\nIn \\cite{Er79} Erd\\H{o}s says perhaps $s_{n+1}-s_n \\ll \\log s_n$, but he is 'very doubtful'.\n\nFilaseta and Trifonov \\cite{FiTr92} proved an upper bound of $s_n^{1/5+o(1)}$. Pandey \\cite{Pa24} has improved this exponent to $1/5-c$ for some constant $c>0$.\n\nGranville \\cite{Gr98} showed that $s_{n+1}-s_n\\ll_\\epsilon s_n^\\epsilon$ for all $\\epsilon>0$ follows from the ABC conjecture.\n\nSee also [489] and [145].
