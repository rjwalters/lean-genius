Specifically, can we build a graph on ω₂² (the square of the second uncountable ordinal) with chromatic number ℵ₂, where every smaller subgraph has countable chromatic number? This generalizes an Erdős-Hajnal construction at the ℵ₁ level.",
    "mathContext": "The problem combines graph theory with set theory, using cardinal and ordinal arithmetic. It relates to how chromatic constraints propagate through infinite graph structures.",
