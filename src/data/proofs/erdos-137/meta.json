That is, must there always exist a prime $p\\mid N$ such that $p^2\\nmid N$?\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and Selfridge. There are infinitely many $n$ such that $n(n+1)$ is powerful (see [364]). Erd\\H{o}s and Selfridge \\cite{ErSe75} proved that $N$ can never be a perfect power. Erd\\H{o}s remarked that this 'seems hopeless at present'.\n\nIn \\cite{Er82c} he further conjectures that, if $k$ is fixed and $n$ is sufficiently large, then, for all $m$, there must be at least $k$ distinct primes $p$ such that\\[p\\mid m(m+1)\\cdots (m+n)\\]and yet $p^2$ does not divide the right-hand side.\n\nSee also [364].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er82c] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Miscellaneous problems in number theory.
