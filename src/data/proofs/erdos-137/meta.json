  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #137 concerns the arithmetic structure of products of consecutive integers. A number n is **powerful** if every prime p dividing n also satisfies p² | n. Equivalently, n = a²b³ for some positive integers.\n\nThe related **Erdős-Selfridge Theorem** (1975) proves that the product of k ≥ 2 consecutive positive integers is never a perfect power (like m² or m³). This is a landmark result in number theory.\n\nThe powerful version is strictly weaker: perfect powers are powerful, but not vice versa. The conjecture that products of k ≥ 3 consecutive integers are never powerful remains OPEN. For k = 2, counterexamples exist: n(n+1) can be powerful for infinitely many n (e.g., 8 × 9 = 72 = 2³ × 3²).",
    "problemStatement": "Let $k \\geq 3$. Can the product of $k$ consecutive positive integers $(n+1)(n+2)\\cdots(n+k)$ ever be **powerful**?\n\nA number is powerful if every prime in its factorization appears with exponent $\\geq 2$.\n\n**Conjecture**: NO — for $k \\geq 3$, the product is never powerful.\n\n**Known result**: Erdős-Selfridge (1975) proved the product is never a perfect power for $k \\geq 2$.\n\n**Counterexample for k=2**: $8 \\times 9 = 72 = 2^3 \\times 3^2$ is powerful.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by:\n\n1. **Defining powerful numbers**: `Powerful n` means n ≠ 0 and every prime p | n satisfies p² | n.\n\n2. **Basic properties**: Prove 1 is powerful (vacuously), perfect squares are powerful, and squarefree numbers > 1 are NOT powerful.\n\n3. **Erdős-Selfridge theorem**: Axiomatize that products of k ≥ 2 consecutive integers are never perfect powers.\n\n4. **Main conjecture**: Axiomatize the open conjecture for k ≥ 3 and powerful products.\n\n5. **Counterexample**: Prove 72 = 8 × 9 is powerful, showing k = 2 case fails.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Powerful numbers**: Characterized by having no 'singleton' primes in factorization. Numbers like 72 = 2³ × 3² are powerful because both 2² and 3² divide it.",
      "**Consecutive coprimality**: Adjacent integers gcd(n, n+1) = 1, so factors spread across consecutive integers don't combine.",
      "**Erdős-Selfridge gap**: Perfect powers form a strict subclass of powerful numbers. The powerful conjecture is weaker but still open.",
      "**k=2 counterexamples**: Infinitely many n exist with n(n+1) powerful (related to Erdős Problem #364).",
      "**The barrier at k=3**: While 2 consecutive integers can combine to be powerful, 3 or more cannot (conjectured)."
