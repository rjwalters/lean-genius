Is it true that\\[\\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\\mathcal{F}_k)\\sim \\frac{n^2}{6}?\\]\n\n\n\nA question of Brown, Erd\\H{o}s, and S\\'{o}s \\cite{BES73} who proved this is true for $k=4$, and that for all $k\\geq 4$\\[\\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\\mathcal{F}_k)\\asymp_k n^2.\\]In \\cite{Er74c} Erd\\H{o}s writes 'the only argument in favour of this conjecture (the conjecture may easily turn out to be nonsense) is the following theorem': every $3$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with $>\\frac{1}{3}\\binom{n}{2}$ edges contains either a graph on $5$ vertices with $3$ edges or a graph on $6$ vertices with $4$ edges. (This is proved in \\cite{Er74c}.)\n\nThis is essentially a weaker version of [207]. In particular, for $k$ satisfying the right divisibility conditions, the extremal number is known exactly. The asymptotic version asked for here was proved independently by Bohman and Warnke \\cite{BoWa19} and Glock, K\\\"{u}hn, Lo, and Osthus \\cite{GKLO20}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BES73] Brown, W.
