    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1076 (Extremal Numbers for 3-Uniform Hypergraphs)**\n\n**Origin:**\nBrown, Erdős, and Sós (1973) studied extremal problems for r-graphs (hypergraphs). They defined F_k as the family of 3-uniform hypergraphs with k vertices and k-2 edges, and conjectured that ex₃(n, F_k) ~ n²/6 for all k ≥ 5.\n\n**Early Results:**\n- Brown-Erdős-Sós (1973): Proved the k=4 case and showed ex₃(n, F_k) = Θ_k(n²)\n- Erdős (1974): Showed hypergraphs with > (1/3)C(n,2) edges contain F_5 or F_6 members\n\n**The Solution (2019-2020):**\nThe asymptotic conjecture was independently proved by:\n- Bohman and Warnke (2019): \"Large girth approximate Steiner triple systems\"\n- Glock, Kühn, Lo, and Osthus (2020): \"On a conjecture of Erdős on locally sparse Steiner triple systems\"\n\n**Key Insight:**\nThe extremal number n²/6 matches the edge density of Steiner triple systems. The proofs use sophisticated probabilistic constructions of approximate Steiner systems with large girth.",
