    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #987: Exponential Sums**\n\nThis problem concerns the behavior of exponential sums over arbitrary sequences. Given any sequence x₁,x₂,... in (0,1), we form the sums ∑e(kxⱼ) where e(x) = e^{2πix}. The function Aₖ measures how large these sums can get.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős (1964)**: Observed that the supremum over n is unbounded as k→∞.\n- **Erdős (1965)**: Proved the 'very easy' result that Aₖ ≫ log k infinitely often.\n- **Clunie (1967)**: Major breakthrough - proved Aₖ ≫ √k infinitely often, and constructed sequences with Aₖ ≤ k for all k.\n- **Tao**: Independently proved the √k lower bound.\n- **Liu (1969)**: For finitely many distinct points, showed Aₖ ≫ k^{1-ε}.\n\n**Problem Source:**\nThis is Problem 7.21 in Hayman's 'Research problems in function theory' (1974), attributed to Erdős.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Open)**\n\nLet $x_1, x_2, \\ldots \\in (0,1)$ be an infinite sequence. Define:\n$$A_k = \\limsup_{n \\to \\infty}\\left|\\sum_{j \\leq n} e(kx_j)\\right|$$\nwhere $e(x) = e^{2\\pi ix}$.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Is $\\limsup_{k \\to \\infty} A_k = \\infty$? **YES** (proved)\n2. Is it possible for $A_k = o(k)$? **OPEN**\n\n**Known:**\n- $A_k \\geq C\\sqrt{k}$ infinitely often (Clunie, Tao)\n- There exist sequences with $A_k \\leq k$ for all $k$ (Clunie)\n\n**Gap:** The question of whether $o(k)$ but $\\neq o(\\sqrt{k})$ is achievable remains open.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** Define e(x) = e^{2πix}, partial sums, and the Aₖ function using limsup.\n\n2. **Early Results:** Axiomatize Erdős's 1964 and 1965 results (unboundedness and log k bound).\n\n3. **Clunie's Theorems:** State √k lower bound and O(k) upper construction.\n\n4. **Liu's Results:** Axiomatize the stronger bounds for finite distinct points.\n\n5. **Open Question:** Define SublinearGrowth (Aₖ = o(k)) and state the open question.\n\n6. **Connections:** Include relationship to discrepancy theory via Erdős-Turán inequality.",
