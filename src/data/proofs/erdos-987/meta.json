Clunie \\cite{Cl67} proved that $A_k\\gg k^{1/2}$ infinitely often, and that there exist sequences with $A_k\\leq k$ for all $k$. Tao has independently found a proof that $A_k\\gg k^{1/2}$ infinitely often (see the comment section).\n\nLiu \\cite{Li69} showed that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, $A_k\\gg k^{1-\\epsilon}$ infinitely often, under the additional assumption that there are only a finite number of distinct points. Clunie observed in the Mathscinet review of \\cite{Li69}, however, that under this assumption in fact $A_k=\\infty$ infinitely often.\n\nThe question of whether $A_k=o(k)$ is possible (repeated in \\cite{Er65b} and \\cite{Ha74}) seems to still be open.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cl67] Clunie, J., On a problem of {E}rd\\H{o}s.
