Then\\[\\#\\{ m<n_k : m\\not\\equiv a_i\\pmod{n_i} \\textrm{ for }1\\leq i\\leq k\\}\\neq o(k).\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{ErGr80} suggest this 'may have to await improvements in current sieve methods' (of which there have been several since 1980).\n\nNote that since the $k$th prime is $\\sim k\\log k$ the lower bound $n_k>(1+\\epsilon)k\\log k$ is best possible here.\n\nCambie has observed that this question has a trivial negative answer, since taking $n_k=2^k$ and $a_k=2^{k-1}+1$ for $k\\geq 1$ implies the only $m$ not in any congruence class is $1$, so the count is actually $1$!\n\nFor further discussion on counterexamples, and what a non-trivial variant of this problem might be, see the comments.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
