    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #805 asks about the 'everywhere Ramsey' property of graphs. The question: for which threshold functions g(n) does there exist an n-vertex graph where EVERY induced subgraph on g(n) vertices contains both a large clique and a large independent set?\n\nErdős and Hajnal conjectured that g(n) = (log n)³ is too small—no such graph should exist. Alon and Sudakov (2007) proved this up to a log log n factor: no such graph exists for g(n) = c(log n)³/(log log n).\n\nAlon, Bucić, and Sudakov (2021) showed the positive direction: such graphs DO exist for g(n) ≤ 2^{2^{√(log log n)}}. The exact threshold remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "For which functions $g(n)$ with $n > g(n) \\geq (\\log n)^2$ is there a graph on $n$ vertices in which every induced subgraph on $g(n)$ vertices contains:\n- a clique of size $\\geq \\log n$, AND\n- an independent set of size $\\geq \\log n$?\n\nIn particular, is there such a graph for $g(n) = (\\log n)^3$?\n\n**Status:** PARTIALLY SOLVED\n\n**Results:**\n- Alon-Sudakov (2007): No such graph for $g(n) = c(\\log n)^3/(\\log\\log n)$\n- Alon-Bucić-Sudakov (2021): Yes for $g(n) \\leq 2^{2^{\\sqrt{\\log\\log n}}}$",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines cliques, independent sets, and the 'everywhere Ramsey' property. The negative result of Alon-Sudakov and positive result of Alon-Bucić-Sudakov are axiomatized. The gap between the bounds shows the exact threshold is still undetermined.",
