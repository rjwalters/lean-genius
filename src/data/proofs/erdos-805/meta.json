Alon and Sudakov \\cite{AlSu07} proved that there is no such graph with\\[g(n)=\\frac{c}{\\log\\log n}(\\log n)^3\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nAlon, Buci\\'{c}, and Sudakov \\cite{ABS21} construct such a graph with\\[g(n)\\leq 2^{2^{(\\log\\log n)^{1/2+o(1)}}}.\\]See also [804].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ABS21] Alon, Noga and Buci\\'c, Matija and Sudakov, Benny, Large cliques and independent sets all over the place.
