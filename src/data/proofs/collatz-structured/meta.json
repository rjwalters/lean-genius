  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Collatz conjecture was proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937, though he didn't publish it until years later. It has many names: the 3n+1 problem, the Syracuse problem, Kakutani's problem, Hasse's algorithm, and Ulam's problem.\n\nDespite its simple statement, the conjecture has resisted all proof attempts. Paul Erdos famously said: 'Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems.' It's been verified for all n up to 2^68 (about 10^20) by computation.\n\nTerence Tao proved in 2019 that almost all Collatz orbits attain almost bounded values, the strongest result toward the conjecture to date.",
    "problemStatement": "**The Collatz Function**:\n$$f(n) = \\begin{cases} n/2 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even} \\\\ 3n+1 & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n\n**The Conjecture**: For every positive integer n, repeatedly applying f eventually reaches 1.\n\n**What We Prove**:\n- Powers of 2: 2^k reaches 1 in k steps\n- Closure: if n reaches 1, so does 2^m * n\n- Specific verified values: 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 27",
    "proofStrategy": "The key insight is that powers of 2 are trivial:\n\n$$2^k \\to 2^{k-1} \\to \\cdots \\to 2 \\to 1$$\n\nEach step halves the value. This is proven by induction on k.\n\nFor the closure property: if n reaches 1 in k steps, then 2n reaches 1 in k+1 steps (first step halves 2n to n).\n\nFor specific values like 27, we use `native_decide` to computationally verify the entire trajectory.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Powers of 2 form the 'backbone' that all trajectories eventually reach",
      "The closure property means we only need to verify odd numbers",
      "27 is famous for its long trajectory (111 steps) despite being small",
      "The conjecture is equivalent to: no cycles exist other than 4 -> 2 -> 1"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization proves the Collatz conjecture for an important infinite family: all numbers of the form 2^m * n where we've verified n reaches 1. The closure property is key—once we verify any odd number, all its multiples by powers of 2 are covered.\n\nThe proof for powers of 2 is clean and illustrative: each application of the Collatz function halves the value until we reach 1. The specific verifications (especially 27's 111 steps) demonstrate how Lean's native_decide can handle substantial computations.",
    "implications": "**Computational Verification**\n\nThis approach scales well: once we verify one odd number reaches 1, infinitely many even numbers are covered. The hard cases are odd numbers that grow before eventually descending.\n\n**The 27 Example**\n\n27 is famous because it takes 111 steps despite being small:\n27 -> 82 -> 41 -> 124 -> 62 -> 31 -> 94 -> 47 -> 142 -> 71 -> 214 -> 107 -> 322 -> ... -> 1\n\nThe maximum value in the trajectory is 9232, showing how even small starting values can have dramatic orbits.",
