    "historicalContext": "**Cycles with Chords**\\n\\nA chord of a cycle is an edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices on the cycle. Erdős asked: what is the maximum number of edges in a graph that avoids cycles with k chords incident to a single vertex?\\n\\n**Early Results**\\n\\nCzipszer proved g_k(n) ≤ (k+1)n. Erdős showed g_k(n) ≥ (k+1)n - (k+1)² via an explicit construction. Pósa proved g_1(n) = 2n - 4 for n ≥ 4.\\n\\n**Jiang's Resolution (2004)**\\n\\nJiang proved the conjecture for n ≥ 3k + 3, showing g_k(n) = (k+1)n - (k+1)² exactly. This is a beautiful extremal result with a clean formula.\\n\\n**Curious Historical Note**\\n\\nIn 1969, Erdős mentioned that Lewin claimed to disprove the conjecture (via oral communication). This was likely for small n or simply incorrect, as Jiang's proof confirms the conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let g_k(n) be the maximal number of edges possible on a graph with n vertices which does not contain a cycle with k chords incident to a vertex on the cycle. Is it true that g_k(n) = (k+1)n - (k+1)² for n sufficiently large?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize graphs using SimpleGraph from Mathlib, then define cycles, chords, and the property of avoiding cycles with k chords incident to a vertex. The function g_k is axiomatized with bounds from Czipszer (upper) and Erdős (lower). Special cases by Pósa (k=1) and Erdős (k=2,3) are included. Jiang's theorem gives the exact formula for n ≥ 3k+3. Computational examples verify the formula.",
