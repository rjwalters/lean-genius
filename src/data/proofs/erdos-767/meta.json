Is it true that\\[g_k(n)=(k+1)n-(k+1)^2\\]for $n$ sufficiently large?\n\n\n\nCzipszer proved that $g_k(n)$ exists for all $k$, and in fact $g_k(n)\\leq (k+1)n$. Erd\\H{o}s wrote it is 'easy to see' that\\[g_k(n)\\geq (k+1)n-(k+1)^2.\\]P\\'{o}sa proved that $g_1(n)=2n-4$ for $n\\geq 4$. Erd\\H{o}s could prove the conjectured equality for $n\\geq 2k+2$ when $k=2$ or $k=3$.\n\nThe conjectured equality was proved for $n\\geq 3k+3$ by Jiang \\cite{Ji04}.\n\nCuriously, in \\cite{Er69b} Erd\\H{o}s mentions this problem, but states that his conjectured equality for $g_k(n)$ was disproved (for general $k$) by Lewin, citing oral communication. Perhaps Lewin only disproved this for small $n$, or perhaps Lewin's disproof was simply incorrect.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er69b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Problems and results in chromatic graph theory.
