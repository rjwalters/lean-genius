Determine\\[\\max\\left(\\sum x_{i_r}\\right),\\]where the maximum is taken over all monotonic subsequences.\n\n\n\nThis is as Erd\\H{o}s posed the problem in \\cite{Er71}, which is rather ambiguous. Discussion between several users in the comments section has led to the following precise possible question, as posed by van Doorn:\n\nWhat is the largest constant $c$ such that, for all sequences of $n$ real numbers $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$,\\[\\max\\left(\\sum x_{i_r}\\right)> (c-o(1))\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum x_i\\](where again the maximum is taken over all monotonic subsequences)? A construction of Cambie in the comments shows that $c\\leq 1$. Hanani \\cite{Ha57} showed that every sequence is the disjoint union of at most $(\\sqrt{2}+o(1))\\sqrt{n}$ many monotonic subsequences, whence $c\\geq 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nCambie makes the stronger conjecture that if $x_1,\\ldots,x_{k^2}$ are distinct positive real numbers with $\\sum x_i=1$ then there is always a monotonic subsequence with sum at least $1/k$. This is a weighted-form of the Erd\\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem, and is also mentioned (as an open question) in a survey on the latter by Steele \\cite{St95}.\n\nThis stronger conjecture appears to have been first proved by Tidor, Wang, and Yang \\cite{TWY16}, and is also implicit in work of Wagner \\cite{Wa17}. A proof was given and formalised by Aristotle (see the comments), with an alternative proof provided by Chan. In particular, this shows that $c=1$.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er71] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis.
