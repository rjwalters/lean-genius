Does the density of integers $n$ such that $P(n)<n^{\\alpha}$ and $P(n+1)<(n+1)^\\beta$ exist?\n\n\n\n\nDickman \\cite{Di30} showed the density of smooth $n$, with largest prime factor $<n^\\alpha$, is $\\rho(1/\\alpha)$ where $\\rho$ is the Dickman function.\n\nErd\\H{o}s also asked whether infinitely many such $n$ even exist, but Meza has observed that this follows immediately from Schinzel's result \\cite{Sc67b} that for infinitely many $n$ the largest prime factor of $n(n+1)$ is at most $n^{O(1/\\log\\log n)}$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s asked whether the events $P(n)<n^\\alpha$ and $P(n+1)<(n+1)^\\beta$ are independent, in the sense that the density of $n$ satisfying both conditions is equal to $\\rho(1/\\alpha)\\rho(1/\\beta)$.\n\nTer\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{Te18} has proved the logarithmic density exists and is equal to $\\rho(1/\\alpha)\\rho(1/\\beta)$.\n\nWang \\cite{Wa21} has proved the density is $\\rho(1/\\alpha)\\rho(1/\\beta)$ assuming the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture for friable integers.\n\nSee also [370].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Di30] K.
