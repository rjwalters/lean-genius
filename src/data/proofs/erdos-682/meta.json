These give a counterexample since $30030=2\\cdot 3 \\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdot 11\\cdot 13$ and every integer in $[2184,2200]$ is divisible by at least one of these primes.\n\nThis was solved in the affirmative by Gafni and Tao \\cite{GaTa25}, who proved that the number of exceptional $n\\in [1,X]$ is\\[\\ll \\frac{X}{(\\log X)^2},\\]and proved, conditional on a form of the prime tuples conjecture, that the number of exceptional $n\\in[1,X]$ satisifes\\[\\sim c\\frac{X}{(\\log X)^2}\\]for some explicit $c>0$.\n\nSee also [680] and [681].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GaTa25] A.
