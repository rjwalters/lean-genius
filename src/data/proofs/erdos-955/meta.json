It is possible for $s(A)$ to have positive density even if $A$ has zero density (for example taking $A$ to be the product of two distinct primes). Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er73b} proved that there are sets $A$ of positive density such that $s^{-1}(A)$ is empty.\n\nPollack \\cite{Po14b} has shown that this is true if $A$ is the set of primes. Troupe \\cite{Tr15} has shown that this is true if $A$ is the set of integers with unusually many prime factors. Troupe \\cite{Tr20} has also shown this is true if $A$ is the set of integers which are the sum of two squares.\n\nPollack, Pomerance, and Thompson \\cite{PPT18} prove that if $\\epsilon(x)=o(1)$ and $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ has size at most $x^{1/2+\\epsilon(x)}$ then\\[\\#\\{ n\\leq x: s(n)\\in A\\} =o(x)\\]as $x\\to \\infty$. It follows that (using $s(n)\\ll n\\log\\log n$) if $A$ grows like $\\lvert A\\cap [1,x]\\rvert\\leq x^{1/2+o(1)}$ then $s^{-1}(A)$ has density $0$.\n\nAlanen calls $k$ such that $s(n)=k$ has no solutions untouchable. These are discussed in problem B10 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGPS90] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Granville, A. and Pomerance, C. and Spiro, C., On the normal behavior of the iterates of some arithmetic functions.
