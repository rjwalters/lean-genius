  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This was a conjecture of Erdős communicated personally to Bálint. Bálint proved it in 1960. Lorch (1976) gave generalizations to higher derivatives and other polynomial families.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(x) ∈ ℝ[x] be a polynomial of degree n whose roots form an arithmetic progression a₀ < a₁ < ... < aₙ. Then the gaps between consecutive critical points of f'(x), measured from the midpoint outward, are monotonically increasing.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses the special symmetry of polynomials with evenly spaced roots. By Rolle's theorem, f' has n critical points between the n+1 roots. The key insight involves convexity arguments showing that gaps increase away from the center.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "By Rolle's theorem, f' has exactly n critical points in (a₀, aₙ)",
      "The polynomial with AP roots has symmetry about its center",
      "Critical points cluster toward the center, making outer gaps larger",
      "Convexity of auxiliary functions establishes the monotonicity"
