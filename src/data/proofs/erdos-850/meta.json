  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Known as the Erdős-Woods conjecture. Shorey and Tijdeman showed that a strong form of the ABC conjecture implies the answer is no. For the two-shift version, solutions exist via x = 2(2^r - 1), y = x(x+2), and the Makowski example (75, 1215).",
    "problemStatement": "Do there exist distinct positive integers x and y such that x,y share the same prime factors, x+1,y+1 share the same prime factors, and x+2,y+2 also share the same prime factors?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define SamePrimeFactors via Nat.primeFactors equality, state the conjecture for k=2, generalize to k-shift, and prove structural properties. The connection to the ABC conjecture via Shorey-Tijdeman is stated.",

      "The two-shift version (k=1) is solvable, but the three-shift version (k=2) is conjectured unsolvable",
      "The strong ABC conjecture implies the three-shift version has no solutions",
      "The parametric family x = 2(2^r-1) gives infinitely many two-shift solutions",
      "The k-shift problem is monotone: unsolvability for k implies unsolvability for k-1"
