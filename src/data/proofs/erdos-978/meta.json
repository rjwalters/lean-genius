  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #978: Power-Free Values of Polynomials**\n\nThis problem concerns the density of integers n for which f(n) avoids having high prime powers as divisors.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős (1953): Infinitely many (d-1)-power-free values exist\n- Hooley (1967): Proved positive density for (d-1)-power-free with asymptotics\n- Heath-Brown (2006): Proved (d-2)-power-free result for d ≥ 10\n- Browning (2011): Extended to d ≥ 9 with asymptotic formula\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nA number n is k-power-free if no prime p satisfies p^k | n. Squarefree = 2-power-free, cubefree = 3-power-free. The question asks how often polynomial values are power-free.",

    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Power-Free Numbers:** Define IsPowerFree(k, n) as no prime p having p^k | n.\n\n2. **Special Cases:** IsSquarefree = IsPowerFree(2), IsCubefree = IsPowerFree(3).\n\n3. **Irreducible Polynomials:** Define for ℤ[x] with degree condition.\n\n4. **Density Function:** Define asymptotic density of power-free values.\n\n5. **Erdős 1953:** Axiomatize infinitely many (d-1)-power-free values.\n\n6. **Hooley 1967:** Axiomatize positive density result.\n\n7. **Heath-Brown/Browning:** Axiomatize (d-2)-power-free for d ≥ 9.\n\n8. **Open Problem:** State the n⁴ + 2 squarefree conjecture.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #978 asked three questions about power-free values of irreducible polynomials. Question 1 (positive density of (d-1)-power-free values) was fully answered YES by Hooley (1967). Question 2 (infinitely many (d-2)-power-free values) was answered YES for d ≥ 9 by Heath-Brown (2006) and Browning (2011), but remains open for d < 9. Question 3 (n⁴ + 2 squarefree infinitely often) remains OPEN since degree 4 < 9.",
    "implications": "**Implications in Number Theory**\n\n1. **Power-Free Hierarchy:** Easier to be (d-1)-power-free than (d-2)-power-free\n\n2. **Degree Threshold:** Current methods only work for d ≥ 9\n\n3. **Sieve Methods:** Hooley's and subsequent work use sophisticated sieve techniques\n\n4. **Partial Information:** n⁴ + 2 IS cubefree infinitely often\n\n5. **Related Open Problems:** 2ⁿ ± 1 and n! ± 1 power-free questions",
