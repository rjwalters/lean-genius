  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #126 originates from the first joint paper of Erdős and Turán (1934), prompted by Lázár and Grünwald. They established that log(n) ≪ f(n) ≪ n/log(n). The conjecture f(n)/log(n) → ∞ carries a $250 prize. Erdős also noted that f(n) = o(n/log(n)) has never been proved. References: [ErTu34], [Er95c], [Er97].",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be the maximum value such that for any A ⊆ N with |A| = n, the product of all (a+b) for distinct a,b in A has at least f(n) distinct prime factors. Is f(n)/log(n) → ∞? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsMaximalAddFactorsCard using Finset.offDiag and primeFactors. The main conjecture uses Tendsto with atTop. The Erdős-Turán bounds are formalized as Big-O and the little-o question is stated separately.",

      "Erdős-Turán (1934): log(n) ≪ f(n) ≪ n/log(n)",
      "The trivial upper bound comes from A = {1,...,n} and the prime number theorem",
      "Whether f(n) = o(n/log(n)) is itself an open question",
      "The conjecture asks if f(n) grows strictly faster than log(n)"
