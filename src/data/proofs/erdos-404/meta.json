  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the divisibility of sums of factorials by prime powers. It connects p-adic analysis with combinatorial number theory. Lin proved that f(2,2) ≤ 254, establishing a concrete upper bound for one case. The problem cannot be resolved by finite computation alone.",
    "problemStatement": "For which integers a ≥ 1 and primes p is there a finite upper bound on k such that there exist a = a₁ < a₂ < ··· < aₙ with p^k | (a₁! + ··· + aₙ!)? If f(a,p) denotes the greatest such k, how does it behave? Also: Is there p and sequence with v_p(∑aᵢ!) → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The analysis uses p-adic valuations and Legendre's formula v_p(n!) = ∑⌊n/p^i⌋. Understanding when sums of factorials have high p-adic valuation requires analyzing cancellation patterns and the structure of factorial ratios.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #404 asks about the divisibility of factorial sums by prime powers. The function f(a,p) measures the maximum power of p that can divide such sums. Lin showed f(2,2) ≤ 254. The general behavior of f(a,p) and the secondary question remain open.",
