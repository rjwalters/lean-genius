    "problemStatement": "Let $R(3,3,n)$ denote the smallest integer $m$ such that if we $3$-colour the edges of $K_m$ then there is either a monochromatic triangle in one of the first two colours or a monochromatic $K_n$ in the third colour. Define $R(3,n)$ similarly but with two colours. Show that\\[\\frac{R(3,3,n)}{R(3,n)}\\to \\infty\\]as $n\\to \\infty$. A problem of Erdős and Sós. This was solved by Alon and Rödl [AlRo05], who in fact show that\\[R(3,3,n)\\asymp n^3(\\log n)^{O(1)}\\](recalling that Shearer [Sh83] showed $R(3,n) \\ll n^2/\\log n$). This problem is #22 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection. See also [925]. View the LaTeX source",
