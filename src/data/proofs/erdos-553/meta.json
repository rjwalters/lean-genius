  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, posed by Erdős and Sós, concerns the asymptotic behavior of multi-color Ramsey numbers. The standard Ramsey number R(3,n) is the minimum m such that any 2-coloring of K_m has either a red triangle or a blue K_n. The three-color variant R(3,3,n) allows two colors for triangles and one for the large clique.\n\nThe key insight is that having two 'triangle' colors dramatically increases the threshold, because two triangle-free graphs (one per color) can together cover many more edges than one alone. Alon and Rödl proved this in 2005, establishing precise asymptotic bounds.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definitions:**\n- R(3,n) = min m : any 2-coloring of K_m has a red triangle or blue K_n\n- R(3,3,n) = min m : any 3-coloring of K_m has a red triangle, blue triangle, or green K_n\n\n**Question:** Show that R(3,3,n) / R(3,n) → ∞ as n → ∞.\n\n**Solution (Alon-Rödl 2005):**\n- R(3,3,n) ≍ n³ · (log n)^O(1)\n- R(3,n) ≪ n² / log n (Shearer 1983)\n- Ratio grows like n · (log factors) → ∞",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines `EdgeColoring n k` for k-colorings of K_n\n2. Defines `HasMonochromaticTriangle` and `HasMonochromaticClique`\n3. Constructs `R_3_n n` and `R_3_3_n n` as Ramsey numbers\n4. States Shearer's upper bound: R(3,n) ≤ Cn²/log n\n5. States Alon-Rödl bounds: R(3,3,n) ≍ n³(log n)^O(1)\n6. Proves `RatioTendsToInfinity` from these bounds\n7. Provides intuition via Turán-type edge counting",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Two Colors vs Three:** In 2-coloring, one color's edges must be triangle-free (≤ n²/4 edges by Turán). In 3-coloring, two colors can be triangle-free, allowing n²/2 edges total—double the room for the clique color.",
      "**Shearer's Bound (1983):** R(3,n) ≤ Cn²/log n. The triangle-free constraint limits edge density, forcing the clique color to dominate quickly.",
      "**Alon-Rödl Bound (2005):** R(3,3,n) ≍ n³(log n)^O(1). Two triangle-free colors can support much denser edge structures before forcing a large clique.",
      "**Ratio Growth:** R(3,3,n)/R(3,n) ≈ n³/n² = n → ∞. The cubic vs quadratic growth drives the divergence.",
      "**General Pattern:** For r triangle-colors, expect R(3,...,3,n) ~ n^(r+1), suggesting deeper Erdős-Sós conjectures."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #553 asks whether R(3,3,n)/R(3,n) → ∞. Alon and Rödl (2005) proved this by establishing R(3,3,n) ≍ n³(log n)^O(1) compared to Shearer's R(3,n) ≪ n²/log n. The ratio grows like n times logarithmic factors, confirming the conjecture. The formalization captures the definitions, bounds, and provides Turán-style intuition for why additional triangle colors dramatically increase the threshold.",
