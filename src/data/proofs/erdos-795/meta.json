  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős introduced the function g(n) in 1966, studying sets where every subset has a unique product. This connects to the classical study of primitive sets and multiplicative structures in number theory. The problem asks whether the natural construction using primes and prime squares is essentially optimal.",
    "problemStatement": "Let g(n) be the maximal size of A ⊆ {1,...,n} such that the products ∏_{a∈S} a are distinct for all S ⊆ A. Is it true that g(n) ≤ π(n) + π(n^{1/2}) + o(n^{1/2}/log n)?",
    "proofStrategy": "Raghavan (2025) establishes both tight upper and lower bounds. The upper bound uses careful analysis of how non-prime elements can coexist with primes while maintaining distinct products. The lower bound constructs explicit sets using primes, squares of primes, and some cubes of primes.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Optimal sets consist primarily of primes (unique factorization ensures distinct products)",
      "Squares of small primes add π(√n) elements without creating collisions",
      "Cubes of primes contribute about π(∛n)/3 additional elements",
      "The error term n^{5/12+o(1)} is significantly smaller than π(√n)"
