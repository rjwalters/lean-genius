    "historicalContext": "Hilbert's 21st Problem (1900) asks whether linear differential equations with prescribed singularities and monodromy always exist. This is the Riemann-Hilbert problem, connecting complex analysis, differential equations, and representation theory.\n\nPlemelj claimed a positive solution in 1908, but Bolibrukh discovered counterexamples in 1989, showing the answer is nuanced.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question:** Given singular points z_1, ..., z_m and a monodromy representation rho: pi_1(C \\ {z_1,...,z_m}) -> GL(n, C), does there exist a Fuchsian system dY/dz = A(z)Y with these singularities and monodromy?\n\n**Answer:** YES for irreducible representations (Plemelj). NO in general (Bolibrukh).",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof strategy involves:\n\n1. Define Fuchsian systems (ODEs with simple poles)\n2. Define monodromy representations (fundamental group to GL(n))\n3. Prove existence for irreducible case (Plemelj's theorem)\n4. Exhibit counterexamples for reducible case (Bolibrukh)\n5. State complete characterization via vector bundle conditions",
