    "historicalContext": "**Erdős-Faudree Conjecture (1985)**\n\nErdős and Faudree conjectured that dense graphs (minimum degree at least half the vertex count) can be partitioned into 4-cycles. This is part of a family of 'cycle partition' problems including the Corrádi-Hajnal theorem for triangles and El-Zahar's general conjecture.\n\n**Solution:** Wang (2010) proved the conjecture using structural analysis of minimal counterexamples.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nIf G is a graph with 4k vertices and minimum degree at least 2k, must G contain k vertex-disjoint 4-cycles?\n\n**Answer: YES** (Wang 2010)\n\nThe minimum degree condition is sharp: there exist graphs with minimum degree 2k-1 that fail.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph structure:** Define FourCycle as a structure with 4 distinct vertices forming a cycle.\n2. **Disjointness:** Define vertex-disjoint cycles using Finset.Disjoint.\n3. **Conjecture:** Formalize ErdosFaudreeConjecture with cardinality and degree conditions.\n4. **Wang's theorem:** Axiomatize as wang_theorem.\n5. **Related results:** Note connections to Dirac, Corrádi-Hajnal, El-Zahar.",
