It is clear that such a maximal $A$ must contain all non-squarefree numbers. It therefore suffices to find the largest size of a subset of all squarefree numbers in $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that any two have at least one prime factor in common. By the result of Chv\\'{a}tal \\cite{Ch74} discussed in [701] this is maximised by the set of all even squarefree numbers.\n\nAn alternative proof was independently found by Alexeev, Mixon, and Sawin \\cite{AMS25}.\n\nSee also [848].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AMS25] B.
