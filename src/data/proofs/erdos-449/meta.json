Is it true that, for every $\\epsilon>0$,\\[r(n) < \\epsilon \\tau(n)\\]for almost all $n$, where $\\tau(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$?\n\n\n\nThis is false - indeed, for any constant $K>0$ we have $r(n)>K\\tau(n)$ for a positive density set of $n$. Kevin Ford has observed this follows from the negative solution to [448]: the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies\\[r(n)+\\tau(n)\\geq \\tau(n)^2/\\tau^+(n)\\]where $\\tau^+(n)$ is as defined in [448], and the negative solution to [448] implies the right-hand side is at least $(K+1)\\tau(n)$ for a positive density set of $n$. (This argument is given for an essentially identical problem by Hall and Tenenbaum \\cite{HaTe88}, Section 4.6.)\n\nSee also [448].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[HaTe88] Hall, Richard R. and Tenenbaum, G\\'{e}rald, Divisors.
