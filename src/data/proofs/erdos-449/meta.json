  "description": "Erdős Problem #449 asks whether 'close' divisor pairs (d₁, d₂) with d₁ < d₂ < 2d₁ are rare compared to total divisors. Specifically: is r(n) < ε·τ(n) for almost all n? The answer is NO - for any K > 0, a positive density set has r(n) > K·τ(n).",

    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #449 investigates whether divisor pairs that are 'close' (within a factor of 2) are rare. The conjecture that such pairs become negligible was disproved by Kevin Ford, who connected it to Problem 448 about the τ⁺ function using Cauchy-Schwarz.",
    "problemStatement": "Let r(n) count pairs (d₁, d₂) with d₁ | n, d₂ | n, and d₁ < d₂ < 2d₁. Is r(n) < ε·τ(n) for almost all n, for every ε > 0? Answer: NO. For any K > 0, there exists a positive density set of n with r(n) > K·τ(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The disproof uses Cauchy-Schwarz to establish r(n) + τ(n) ≥ τ(n)²/τ⁺(n), where τ⁺(n) counts divisors d with d² ≤ n. Problem 448's negative solution shows τ⁺(n) can be much smaller than τ(n) for positive density, making r(n) arbitrarily large relative to τ(n).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Close divisor pairs are NOT rare - they can dominate the divisor count",
      "The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality provides the key bound r(n) + τ(n) ≥ τ(n)²/τ⁺(n)",
      "Connection to Problem 448: when τ⁺(n) << τ(n), close pairs must be abundant",
      "For n = 12: τ(12) = 6, r(12) = 5, demonstrating close pairs can be common"
