  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The divisor sum function σₖ(n) = Σ_{d|n} d^k is fundamental to number theory. Erdős and Kac posed the problem of whether the series Σ σₖ(n)/n! is irrational for each k ≥ 1 in 1954.\n\nThe early cases k = 1, 2 were noted as 'reasonably straightforward' by Erdős. The case k = 3 required more sophisticated techniques and was independently solved by Schlage-Puchta in 2006 and Friedlander, Luca, and Stoiciu in 2007. Most recently, Pratt (2022) proved the k = 4 case using arithmetic density arguments.\n\nFor k ≥ 5, the problem remains open unconditionally. However, the conjecture follows from either Schinzel's Hypothesis H or the prime k-tuples conjecture, connecting this problem to deep questions about prime distribution.",
