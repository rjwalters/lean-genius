Is\\[\\sum \\frac{\\sigma_k(n)}{n!}\\]irrational?\n\n\n\nThis is known now for $1\\leq k\\leq 4$. The cases $k=1,2$ are reasonably straightforward, as observed by Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er52}. The case $k=3$ was proved independently by Schlage-Puchta \\cite{ScPu06} and Friedlander, Luca, and Stoiciu \\cite{FLC07}. The case $k=4$ was proved by Pratt \\cite{Pr22}.\n\nIt is known that this sum is irrational for all $k\\geq 1$ conditional on either Schinzel's conjecture (Schlage-Puchta \\cite{ScPu06}) or the prime tuples conjecture (Friedlander, Luca, and Stoiciu \\cite{FLC07}).\n\nThis is discussed in problem B14 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er52] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Problem 4493.
