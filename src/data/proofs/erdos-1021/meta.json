Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er71} could not even prove whether $\\mathrm{ex}(n,G_k)=o(n^{3/2})$.\n\nWhen $k=3$ the graph $G_3$ is the $6$-cycle $C_6$, for which Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64c} and Bondy and Simonovits \\cite{BoSi74} proved $\\mathrm{ex}(n,C_6)\\ll n^{7/6}$ (see [572]).\n\nThe graph $G_k$ is the graph $H_k$ of [926] with the vertex $x$ omitted.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BoSi74] Bondy, J.
