    "historicalContext": "**Extremal Graph Theory**\n\nThe extremal number ex(n, H) is the maximum edges an n-vertex graph can have while avoiding H as a subgraph. This is central to Turán-type problems.\n\n**The Bipartite Pair Graph G_k**: G_k has k 'primary' vertices {y₁,...,y_k} and C(k,2) 'pair' vertices {z₁,...,z_{C(k,2)}}. Each pair vertex z_j connects to exactly one pair of primary vertices.\n\n**Known Constraint**: Erdős-Simonovits proved (unpublished) that any improvement c_k must satisfy c_k → 0 as k → ∞.\n\n**Special Case**: When k = 3, G_3 is the 6-cycle C_6. Erdős and Bondy-Simonovits proved ex(n, C_6) ≪ n^(7/6).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIs it true that for every k ≥ 3, there exists a constant c_k > 0 such that\n\nex(n, G_k) ≪ n^(3/2 - c_k)?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Weak Version**: Even ex(n, G_k) = o(n^(3/2)) is unknown for general k.\n\n**Note**: The trivial bound from Kővári-Sós-Turán is ex(n, G_k) ≪ n^(3/2).",
    "proofStrategy": "**What Would Be Needed**\n\n1. **Beating the Trivial Bound**: The Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem gives n^(3/2). Any improvement requires new techniques.\n\n2. **Structure of G_k**: The specific pair-connectivity structure of G_k should be exploitable.\n\n3. **Dependent Random Choice**: Modern extremal techniques might help.\n\n4. **Connection to H_k**: G_k is H_k (Problem 926) minus one vertex - this relationship may be useful.\n\n**Known Approach (k=3)**: For C_6, algebraic and probabilistic methods give n^(7/6).",
