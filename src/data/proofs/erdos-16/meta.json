  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Romanoff (1934) proved a positive proportion of odd integers can be written as 2^k + p. Erdős (1950) used covering congruences to show the 'exceptional set' (odd integers NOT of this form) contains an infinite arithmetic progression. He conjectured the exceptional set is essentially just this progression plus negligible noise. Chen (2023) disproved this conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Define the exceptional set E = {odd n : n ≠ 2^k + p for all k ≥ 1 and primes p}. Erdős asked: is E = (arithmetic progression) ∪ (density-0 set)? Chen proved NO: E has more complex structure.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Romanoff numbers (n = 2^k + p), the exceptional set, covering congruence systems, and density. Key axioms encode Romanoff's theorem (positive density are representable), Erdős's covering result (E contains a progression), Chen's disproof (the conjecture is false), and the complex structure (multiple independent progressions).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Exceptional set E = {1, 127, 149, 251, 331, ...} (OEIS A006285)",
      "127 is exceptional: 127 - 2^k is composite for all valid k",
      "Erdős's covering system: moduli {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24} ensure composites",
      "E has positive density ~0.09 (from the arithmetic progression)",
      "Chen (2023): E is NOT just one AP + density-0 noise",
      "E contains infinitely many 'independent' progressions with positive density"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #16 is DISPROVED (Chen 2023). The exceptional set of odd integers not representable as 2^k + p has more complex structure than Erdős conjectured. It's not just an arithmetic progression plus negligible noise - it contains multiple independent parts with positive density.",
    "implications": "The result shows that covering congruence constructions produce richer structure than expected. The exceptional set may have fractal-like or quasi-random properties. This connects to deep questions about prime distribution.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact structure of the exceptional set?",
