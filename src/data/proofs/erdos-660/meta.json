Are there at least\\[(1-o(1))\\frac{n}{2}\\]many distinct distances between the $x_i$?\n\n\n\nFor the similar problem in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ there are always at least $n/2$ distances, as proved by Altman \\cite{Al63} (see [93]). In \\cite{Er75f} Erd\\H{o}s claims that Altman proved that the vertices determine $\\gg n$ many distinct distances, but gives no reference.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al63] Altman, E., On a problem of P.
