  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem dates back over 60 years—Erdős proved f(2) = 1 in an early paper for Hungarian high school students. The conjecture asks whether one extra square beyond a perfect k×k grid can increase the sum of side lengths. Newman showed f(5) = 2 via personal communication. Halász (1984) gave improved lower bounds. Recently, Baek-Koizumi-Ueoro (2024) solved the axis-parallel case completely.",
    "problemStatement": "Draw n squares inside the unit square with no common interior point. Let f(n) be the maximum possible sum of the side-lengths. Is f(k²+1) = k?",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines squares by center and side length, with a Packing structure ensuring disjoint interiors and containment. The function f(n) is the supremum of sumSides over all valid packings. Known values (f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(4)=2, f(5)=2, f(k²)=k) are axioms. Halász bounds and the Erdős-Soifer conjecture are captured. The Cauchy-Schwarz bound f(n) ≤ √n provides the upper bound.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The square packing problem asks for the maximum sum of side lengths when packing n non-overlapping squares in the unit square. The conjecture f(k²+1) = k asserts that one extra square beyond a perfect grid doesn't help. This is equivalent to the Erdős-Soifer conjecture f(k²+2c+1) = k + c/k. The axis-parallel case was solved in 2024, but the general rotated case remains open.",
