Let $f(n)$ be the maximum possible sum of the side-lengths of the squares. Is $f(k^2+1)=k$?\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er94b} Erd\\H{o}s dates this conjecture to 'more than 60 years ago'. Erd\\H{o}s proved that $f(2)=1$ in an early mathematical paper for high school students in Hungary. Newman proved (in personal communication to Erd\\H{o}s) that $f(5)=2$.\n\nIt is trivial from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality that $f(k^2)=k$. Erd\\H{o}s also asks for which $n$ is it true that $f(n+1)=f(n)$.\n\nIt is easy to see that $f(k^2+1)\\geq k$, by first dividing the unit square into $k^2$ smaller squares of side-length $1/k$, and then replacing one square by two smaller squares of side-length $1/2k$. Hal\\'{a}sz \\cite{Ha84} gives a construction that shows $f(k^2+2)\\geq k+\\frac{1}{k+1}$, and in general, for any $c\\geq 1$,\\[f(k^2+2c+1)\\geq k+\\frac{c}{k}\\]and\\[f(k^2+2c)\\geq k+\\frac{c}{k+1}.\\]Hal\\'{a}sz also considers the variants where we replace a square by a parallelogram or triangle.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Soifer \\cite{ErSo95} and Campbell and Staton \\cite{CaSt05} have conjectured that, in general, for any integer $-k<c<k$, $f(k^2+2c+1)=k+\\frac{c}{k}$, and proved the corresponding lower bound. Praton \\cite{Pr08} has proved that this general conjecture is equivalent to $f(k^2+1)=k$.\n\nBaek, Koizumi, and Ueoro \\cite{BKU24} have proved $g(k^2+1)=k$, where $g(\\cdot)$ is defined identically to $f(\\cdot)$ with the additional assumption that all squares have sides parallel to the sides of the unit square. More generally, they prove that $g(k^2+2c+1)=k+c/k$ for any $-k<c<k$, which determines all values of $g(\\cdot)$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BKU24] Baek, J. and Koizumi, J. and Ueoro, T., A note on the Erd\\H{o}s conjecture about square packing. arXiv:2411.07274 (2024).\n\n[CaSt05] Campbell, Connie and Staton, William, A square-packing problem of Erd\\H{o}s.
