Find a necessary and sufficient condition on the $a_n$ such that, if we choose (independently and uniformly) random arcs on the unit circle of length $a_n$, then all the circle is covered with probability $1$.\n\n\n\nA problem of Dvoretzky \\cite{Dv56}. It is easy to see that (under the given conditions alone) almost all the circle is covered with probability $1$.\n\nKahane \\cite{Ka59} showed that $a_n=\\frac{1+c}{n}$ with $c>0$ has this property, which Erd\\H{o}s (unpublished) improved to $a_n=\\frac{1}{n}$. Erd\\H{o}s also showed that $a_n=\\frac{1-c}{n}$ with $c>0$ does not have this property.\n\nSolved by Shepp \\cite{Sh72}, who showed that a necessary and sufficient condition is that\\[\\sum_n \\frac{e^{a_1+\\cdots+a_n}}{n^2}=\\infty.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Dv56] Dvoretzky, Aryeh, On covering a circle by randomly placed arcs.
