  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Dvoretzky posed this problem in 1956, asking for a characterization of when random arcs on a circle provide complete coverage. Kahane (1959) showed a_n = (1+c)/n covers with probability 1. Erdős (unpublished) proved a_n = 1/n is the critical case: it covers, but a_n = (1-c)/n fails. Shepp (1972) gave the complete answer via the elegant criterion Σ exp(S_n)/n² = ∞, where S_n is the partial sum of arc lengths.",
    "problemStatement": "Let a_n ≥ 0 with a_n → 0 and Σa_n = ∞. Find a necessary and sufficient condition on the a_n such that random arcs of lengths a_n, placed uniformly and independently on the unit circle, cover the entire circle with probability 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "Shepp used Poisson process techniques to analyze the expected number of uncovered points. The key insight is that at a_n = 1/n, the partial sum S_n grows like log n, making exp(S_n)/n² ~ 1/n, which barely diverges. Below 1/n, the sum converges and coverage fails.",
