  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Rado posed this problem in 1967 as a directed generalization of Ramsey numbers. The problem asks for the minimum number of vertices in a directed graph that forces either a large independent set or a large transitive tournament.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine k(n,m), the minimum k such that every directed graph on k vertices contains an independent set of size n or a transitive tournament of size m.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define directed graphs, independent sets, and transitive tournaments in Lean. We axiomatize k(n,m) and state known bounds from Erdős–Rado, Larson–Mitchell, and Hunter.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "R(n,m) ≤ k(n,m) ≤ R(n,m,m) bounds k(n,m) between Ramsey numbers",
      "Larson–Mitchell proved k(n,3) ≤ n² for transitive triples",
      "Hunter–Steiner solved the directed path variant: k(n,m) = (n-1)(m-1)",
      "The Erdős–Rado bound is exponential in m",

  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #112 asks for the directed Ramsey number k(n,m) guaranteeing independent sets or transitive tournaments. Known bounds span from ordinary Ramsey numbers to 3-color Ramsey numbers, with the exact growth rate undetermined.",
    "implications": "Resolving this would advance understanding of directed Ramsey theory, connecting tournament structure to classical Ramsey bounds and potentially revealing new phenomena in directed graphs.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact growth rate of k(n,m)?",
      "Can the Erdős–Rado upper bound be significantly improved?",
      "Is k(n,m) polynomial in n for fixed m?",
      "What are exact values of k(n,m) for small n, m?"
