  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The divergence of the harmonic series is one of the most counterintuitive results in mathematics. The terms 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ... clearly approach zero, yet their sum is infinite!\n\nNicole Oresme, a 14th-century French philosopher and mathematician, gave the first known proof around 1350. His elegant grouping argument showed that infinitely many groups of terms each sum to more than 1/2. This was one of the earliest uses of infinite series in mathematical reasoning.\n\nThe result was independently rediscovered by Pietro Mengoli (1647) and Johann Bernoulli (1689). Today it serves as a fundamental example in calculus courses, demonstrating that the terms of a series approaching zero is necessary but not sufficient for convergence.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Oresme, ~1350)**: The harmonic series diverges:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\cdots = \\infty$$\n\nMore precisely: the partial sums $H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{k}$ grow without bound as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #34.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Oresme's Grouping Argument:**\n\nGroup the terms strategically:\n\n$$1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + \\cdots$$\n\nEach group of $2^k$ terms (from $2^k$ to $2^{k+1}-1$) sums to at least 1/2:\n\n- $1/3 + 1/4 > 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2$\n- $1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 > 4 \\cdot (1/8) = 1/2$\n- In general: $\\sum_{i=2^k}^{2^{k+1}-1} \\frac{1}{i} \\geq 2^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^{k+1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSince we have infinitely many groups each contributing at least 1/2, the sum is infinite.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The harmonic series provides one of mathematics' most important lessons: a series can diverge even when its terms approach zero. Oresme's elegant 14th-century proof remains the most intuitive explanation—by grouping terms cleverly, we see that infinitely many contributions of 1/2 force the sum to infinity.\n\nThe formalization uses Mathlib's `Real.not_summable_one_div_natCast` for the main result, while also demonstrating Oresme's grouping argument to show why the result is true.",
    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance:**\n\n1. **Convergence tests**: The harmonic series motivates the development of convergence tests (comparison, ratio, root tests) that can distinguish convergent from divergent series.\n\n2. **p-series**: The boundary behavior at p = 1 is fundamental—slight changes to the exponent completely change convergence behavior.\n\n3. **Euler-Mascheroni constant**: The difference $H_n - \\ln(n)$ converges to the mysterious constant $\\gamma \\approx 0.5772$, whose rationality remains an open problem.\n\n**Practical Applications:**\n\nThe harmonic series appears in algorithm analysis (coupon collector's problem), probability theory, and physics (divergent integrals in quantum field theory).",
