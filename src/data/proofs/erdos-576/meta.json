  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from the foundational work of Erdős and Simonovits in 1970 on extremal problems for bipartite graphs. The hypercube graph Q_k is a fundamental structure in combinatorics, appearing in coding theory, Boolean function analysis, and theoretical computer science. Determining the Turán number ex(n; Q_k) asks: what is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that contains no copy of Q_k as a subgraph? While the Erdős-Stone theorem completely resolves this question for non-bipartite graphs, the bipartite case remains notoriously difficult. The hypercube Turán problem exemplifies this difficulty and has attracted attention from leading combinatorialists for over 50 years.",
    "problemStatement": "Let Q_k be the k-dimensional hypercube graph (so that Q_k has 2^k vertices and k·2^(k-1) edges). Determine the behaviour of ex(n; Q_k), the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex Q_k-free graph.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization establishes the key definitions (hypercube graph, Turán number) and states the known bounds as axioms. For the 3-dimensional hypercube Q_3, Erdős and Simonovits (1970) proved (1/2 + o(1))n^(3/2) ≤ ex(n; Q_3) ≪ n^(8/5). Recent work by Sudakov-Tomon (2022) and Janzer-Sudakov (2022) has improved upper bounds for general k. The problem asks whether ex(n; Q_3) ≍ n^(8/5), which remains open. The formalization also captures the broader context of bipartite Turán theory and the Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The hypercube Q_k is bipartite (vertices partition by parity of 1-bits), making Turán theory more difficult",
      "Lower bound construction uses probabilistic methods and algebraic constructions",
      "Upper bounds rely on dependent random choice and regularity methods",
      "The exponent gap (3/2 to 8/5) for Q_3 has remained open for 50+ years",
      "Removing one edge from Q_3 drops the exponent to exactly 3/2"
