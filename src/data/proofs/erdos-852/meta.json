  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this question about the structure of consecutive prime gaps in 1985. The problem asks for the growth rate of h(x), the maximal length of a run of distinct consecutive prime gaps below x. Brun's sieve establishes that h(x) → ∞, but the precise growth rate remains unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Let dₙ = pₙ₊₁ − pₙ. Define h(x) as the maximal k such that some consecutive run dₙ, dₙ₊₁, …, dₙ₊ₖ₋₁ with pₙ < x has all distinct values. Is h(x) > (log x)^c for some c > 0? Is h(x) = o(log x)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize the prime sequence, prime gaps, and the notion of distinct-gap runs. The function h(x) is defined with witness and optimality properties. Brun's divergence result and the two open conjectures are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Prime gaps dₙ = pₙ₊₁ − pₙ encode the local distribution of primes",
      "Brun's sieve ensures h(x) → ∞: long runs of distinct gaps exist",
      "The lower bound conjecture (log x)^c suggests polynomial-in-log growth",
      "The upper bound o(log x) would place h(x) strictly below logarithmic scale"
