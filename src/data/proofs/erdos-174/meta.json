  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Euclidean Ramsey theory was founded by Erdős, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer, and Straus in 1973. The theory asks which geometric configurations have the Ramsey property: no matter how you color high-dimensional space, you can always find a monochromatic copy. This extends classical combinatorial Ramsey theory into the geometric realm.",
    "problemStatement": "A finite set A ⊂ ℝⁿ is called Ramsey if, for any k ≥ 1, there exists d = d(A,k) such that in any k-coloring of ℝᵈ there exists a monochromatic congruent copy of A. Characterize the Ramsey sets in ℝⁿ.",
    "proofStrategy": "The necessary condition (spherical) is proved via a contrapositive argument using distance-based colorings. The sufficient direction (characterizing which spherical sets are Ramsey) remains open, with Graham's conjecture and the Leader-Russell-Walters subtransitivity conjecture as the main candidates.",
