Characterise the Ramsey sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer, and Straus \\cite{EGMRSS73} proved that every Ramsey set is 'spherical': it lies on the surface of some sphere. Graham has conjectured that every spherical set is Ramsey. Leader, Russell, and Walters \\cite{LRW12} have alternatively conjectured that a set is Ramsey if and only if it is 'subtransitive': it can be embedded in some higher-dimensional set on which rotations act transitively.\n\nSets known to be Ramsey include vertices of $k$-dimensional rectangles \\cite{EGMRSS73}, non-degenerate simplices \\cite{FrRo90}, trapezoids \\cite{Kr92}, and regular polygons/polyhedra \\cite{Kr91}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGMRSS73] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R.
