    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #174: Euclidean Ramsey Sets**\n\nEuclidean Ramsey theory was founded by Erdős, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer, and Straus in their landmark 1973 paper. The theory extends classical combinatorial Ramsey theory into the geometric realm: which finite point configurations are guaranteed to appear monochromatically in any coloring of high-dimensional Euclidean space?\n\n**Key Developments:**\n- EGMRSS (1973): Proved the necessary condition—every Ramsey set must be spherical (all points equidistant from some center)\n- Frankl-Rödl (1990): All non-degenerate simplices are Ramsey\n- Kříž (1991-92): Regular polygons, polyhedra, and trapezoids are Ramsey\n- Leader-Russell-Walters (2012): Proposed subtransitivity as the characterizing property\n\n**The Open Problem:**\nThe characterization question remains unsolved. Graham conjectures that every spherical set is Ramsey. The LRW conjecture offers an algebraic alternative: Ramsey iff subtransitive. Neither has been proved or disproved.",
    "problemStatement": "A finite set A ⊂ ℝⁿ is called Ramsey if, for any k ≥ 1, there exists d = d(A,k) such that in any k-coloring of ℝᵈ there exists a monochromatic congruent copy of A. Characterize the Ramsey sets in ℝⁿ.",
    "proofStrategy": "The necessary condition (spherical) is proved via a contrapositive argument using distance-based colorings. The sufficient direction (characterizing which spherical sets are Ramsey) remains open, with Graham's conjecture and the Leader-Russell-Walters subtransitivity conjecture as the main candidates.",
