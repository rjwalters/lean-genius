  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Originally posed by Riddell (1969) and studied extensively by Erdős. A Sidon set (B₂-set) has all pairwise sums distinct. Erdős proved N^{1/3} ≪ ℓ(N), improved to N^{1/2} ≪ ℓ(N) by Komlós, Sulyok, and Szemerédi. The upper bound (1+o(1))N^{1/2} comes from {1,...,N}.",
    "problemStatement": "For a finite set A ⊂ ℝ of size N, let ℓ(N) denote the maximum size of a Sidon subset. Determine the order of growth of ℓ(N). It is conjectured that ℓ(N) ~ N^{1/2}.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define Sidon sets as Finsets with distinct pairwise sums, define the maximum Sidon subset size, state the known lower bounds (Erdős; Komlós–Sulyok–Szemerédi) and upper bound, formalize the main conjecture, and state the Alon–Erdős partition conjecture.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A Sidon set of size k produces k(k+1)/2 distinct pairwise sums, bounding k ≤ O(N^{1/2})",
      "Komlós–Sulyok–Szemerédi's probabilistic argument gives the matching lower bound N^{1/2} ≪ ℓ(N)",
      "The Alon–Erdős partition conjecture (at most ~N^{1/2} Sidon parts) is a dual formulation",
      "The gap between lower and upper bounds is only in the leading constant"
