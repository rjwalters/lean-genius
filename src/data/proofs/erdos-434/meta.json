What choice of $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ (with $\\mathrm{gcd}(A)=1$) of size $\\lvert A\\rvert=k$ maximises the number of integers not representable as the sum of finitely many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)? Is it $\\{n,n-1,\\ldots,n-k+1\\}$?\n\n\n\nAssociated with problems of Frobenius (see also [433]).\n\nThe maximal choice is indeed $\\{n,\\ldots,n-k+1\\}$, as proved by Kiss \\cite{Ki02}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ki02] Kiss, G., On the extremal {F}robenius problem in a new aspect.
