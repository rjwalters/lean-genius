  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #434 is closely related to the classical Frobenius problem (also called the coin problem or money changing problem). Given a set of positive integers with gcd = 1, only finitely many integers are non-representable as sums of elements from the set.\n\nThe Frobenius number is the largest such non-representable integer. For two coprime integers a and b, Sylvester proved in 1884 that this equals ab - a - b.\n\nProblem #434 asks a different question: not what is the largest non-representable integer, but which k-element subset of {1, ..., n} maximizes the COUNT of non-representable integers.\n\nKiss (2002) proved that the answer is the 'top k' set: {n-k+1, ..., n}. Intuitively, using larger numbers creates more gaps in what's representable.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≤ n. What choice of A ⊆ {1, ..., n} of size |A| = k maximizes the number of integers not representable as the sum of finitely many elements from A (with repetitions allowed)?\n\n**Answer**: YES, it is A = {n-k+1, ..., n}\n\nThis was proved by Kiss (2002).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by:\n\n1. **Representability**: Define when n is representable by A using multisets\n2. **Non-representables**: The set of integers not representable\n3. **topK**: The conjectured optimal set {n-k+1, ..., n}\n4. **Kiss's theorem**: Axiomatize that topK achieves the maximum\n5. **Examples**: Verify small cases like {2,3}, {3,5}\n6. **Sylvester-Frobenius**: Connect to the classical formula for two elements\n\nThe key insight is that larger numbers create more gaps. If A contains 1, almost everything is representable. Using only large numbers leaves many integers unreachable.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Representability**: A number n is representable by A if n = a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₘ for some aᵢ ∈ A (repetition allowed). Zero is always representable (empty sum).",
      "**Frobenius number**: For coprime a, b, the largest non-representable is ab - a - b. For {3, 5} it's 3·5 - 3 - 5 = 7.",
      "**Counting matters**: Problem #434 asks to maximize the COUNT, not the largest. The count for coprime a, b is (a-1)(b-1)/2.",
      "**topK is optimal**: {n-k+1, ..., n} maximizes non-representables. Large numbers have longer 'gaps' before sums fill in.",
      "**The greedy approach works**: Always picking the largest available number gives the optimal construction."
