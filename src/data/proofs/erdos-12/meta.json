  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #12 concerns sets with a divisibility constraint: no element can divide the sum of two larger elements. Erdős and Sárközy (1970) proved such sets must have density 0, yet they can still be surprisingly large.\n\nThe problem asks three increasingly strong questions about how sparse these sets must be. Despite 50+ years of work, all three remain OPEN.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be an infinite set of positive integers such that for all distinct a, b, c in A with b, c > a, we have a does NOT divide (b + c).\n\n**Question 1:** Can |A ∩ {1,...,N}| / √N have positive liminf?\n\n**Question 2:** Must |A ∩ {1,...,N}| < N^(1-c) for infinitely many N (some fixed c > 0)?\n\n**Question 3:** Must the sum of 1/n over n in A converge?\n\n**Status:** All three questions are OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `IsDivisibilityFree A`: the constraint a ∤ (b+c) for a < b,c in A\n2. `countingFunction A N`: cardinality of A ∩ {1,...,N}\n3. The three questions as separate propositions\n4. Known results: Erdős-Sárközy (density 0), Elsholtz-Planitzer (best construction), Schoen-Baier (coprime case)\n\nExamples like powers of 2 and prime squares mod 4 illustrate the property.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Density zero is forced:** Erdős-Sárközy (1970) proved all such sets have density 0, but the decay rate is unknown.",
      "**Best construction:** Elsholtz-Planitzer (2017) achieved ~√N / (√log N · (log log N)²), close to √N.",
      "**Powers of 2 work:** {2, 4, 8, 16, ...} is divisibility-free since 2^a can't divide 2^b + 2^c for a < b,c.",
      "**Coprime case solved:** When elements are pairwise coprime, the bound is O(N^(2/3) / log N).",
      "**Three questions hierarchy:** Q3 (convergent sum) ⟹ Q2 (sparse i.o.) ⟹ Q1 (no √N density)."
