The first problem asks whether $m(f)<1$ almost surely. Littlewood \\cite{Li66} conjectured that the stronger $m(f)=o(1)$ holds almost surely.\n\nThe answer to both questions is yes: Littlewood's conjecture was solved by Kashin \\cite{Ka87}, and Konyagin \\cite{Ko94} improved this to show that $m(f)\\leq n^{-1/2+o(1)}$ almost surely. This is essentially best possible, since Konyagin and Schlag \\cite{KoSc99} proved that for any $\\epsilon>0$\\[\\limsup_{n\\to \\infty} \\mathbb\n(m(f) \\leq \\epsilon n^{-1/2})\\ll \\epsilon.\\]Cook and Nguyen \\cite{CoNg21} have identified the limiting distribution, proving that for any $\\epsilon>0$\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} \\mathbb\n(m(f) > \\epsilon n^{-1/2}) = e^{-\\epsilon \\lambda}\\]where $\\lambda$ is an explicit constant.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CoNg21] Cook, Nicholas A. and Nguyen, Hoi H., Universality of the minimum modulus for random trigonometric\npolynomials.
