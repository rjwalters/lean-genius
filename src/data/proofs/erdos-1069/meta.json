When $k=n^{1/2}$ the lattice points show that there can be $\\geq(2+o(1))n^{1/2}$ many $n^{1/2}$-rich lines. Erd\\H{o}s thought that perhaps this is best possible, but Sah \\cite{Sa87} gave a construction achieving $\\geq (3+o(1))n^{1/2}$ many $n^{1/2}$-rich lines.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er87b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some combinatorial and metric problems in geometry.
