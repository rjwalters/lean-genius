    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $f(n)$ be minimal such that any $f(n)$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, no three on a line, contain $n$ points which form the vertices of a convex $n$-gon. Prove that $f(n)=2^{n-2}+1$.\n\n\n\nThe Erd\\H{o}s-Klein-Szekeres 'Happy Ending' problem. The problem originated in 1931 when Klein observed that $f(4)=5$. Tur\\'{a}n and Makai showed $f(5)=9$. Erd\\H{o}s and Szekeres proved the bounds\\[2^{n-2}+1\\leq f(n)\\leq \\binom{2n-4}{n-2}+1.\\](\\cite{ErSz60} and \\cite{ErSz35} respectively). There were several improvements of the upper bound, but all of the form $4^{(1+o(1))n}$, until Suk \\cite{Su17} proved\\[f(n) \\leq 2^{(1+o(1))n}.\\]The current best bound is due to Holmsen, Mojarrad, Pach, and Tardos \\cite{HMPT20}, who prove\\[f(n) \\leq 2^{n+O(\\sqrt{n\\log n})}.\\]In \\cite{Er97e} Erd\\H{o}s clarifies that the \\$500 is for a proof, and only offers \\$100 for a disproof.\n\nThis problem is #1 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.\n\nSee also [216], [651], and [838].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er97e] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some of my favourite unsolved problems.
