    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #395**\n\nThis is the \"reverse Littlewood-Offord problem.\"\n\n**History:**\n- Erdős originally asked with threshold 1 instead of √2\n- Carnielli and Carolino (2011) found a counterexample showing threshold 1 fails\n- The revised problem (threshold √2) became the true question\n- He, Juškevičius, Narayanan, and Spiro (2024) proved YES\n\n**Context:**\n- Classical Littlewood-Offord (1943): upper bound on how often sums hit a point\n- This problem asks for a lower bound on how often sums stay near 0\n- The bound 1/n is optimal",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nIf z₁, ..., zₙ ∈ ℂ with |zᵢ| = 1, is the probability that\n\n|ε₁z₁ + ... + εₙzₙ| ≤ √2\n\n(where εᵢ ∈ {-1, 1} uniformly at random) at least c/n for some absolute constant c > 0?\n\n**Original (Erdős):** Threshold 1 — FALSE (Carnielli-Carolino 2011)\n\n**Revised:** Threshold √2 — TRUE (HJNS 2024)\n\nThe bound 1/n is optimal.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Complex Vectors:** Use Fin n → ℂ for vectors\n\n2. **Key Definitions:**\n   - isUnitVector: |zᵢ| = 1\n   - signedSum: ε₁z₁ + ... + εₙzₙ\n   - probSmallSum: P(|sum| ≤ √2)\n\n3. **Counterexample:**\n   - carnielli_carolino_counterexample: shows threshold 1 fails\n   - For z₁ = 1, zₖ = i, every sum has |sum| ≥ √2\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - hjns_2024: P(|sum| ≤ √2) ≥ c/n for all unit vectors\n   - extremal_example_tight: 1/n rate is optimal\n\n**Why Axioms:** The HJNS proof uses Fourier analysis and concentration inequalities.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**√2 is Threshold:** The counterexample shows < √2 can have probability 0; √2 always has ≥ c/n.",
      "**Reverse Direction:** Classical L-O bounds probability FROM ABOVE; this bounds FROM BELOW.",
      "**Optimal Rate:** The 1/n rate cannot be improved (extremal example achieves it).",
      "**Geometry Matters:** The extremal example has half real (1) and half imaginary (i) components.",
      "**Recent Result:** Solved only in 2024 by HJNS, showing it was a hard problem."

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #395 was solved by He, Juškevičius, Narayanan, and Spiro in 2024. For any unit complex vectors z₁, ..., zₙ, the probability that a random sign sum |ε₁z₁ + ... + εₙzₙ| ≤ √2 is at least c/n. The threshold √2 is crucial (threshold 1 fails), and the 1/n rate is optimal.",
    "implications": "The result completes the picture of Littlewood-Offord type problems: the classical result gives an upper bound on concentration at any point, while this reverse version gives a lower bound on concentration near zero. This connects probability, complex analysis, and combinatorics.",
