  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this in 1980, studying the dynamics of the map n ↦ n + τ(n). It is part of a family of iterated arithmetic function problems (#412, #413, #414) exploring whether simple number-theoretic iterations have universal behavior.",
    "problemStatement": "Let h(n) = n + τ(n). For any m, n ≥ 1, do there exist i, j such that h^i(m) = h^j(n)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize h(n) = n + τ(n), the orbit sequence, and basic properties (strict monotonicity, bounds). We state the merging conjecture and provide concrete orbit computations showing early merges.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "h(n) > n always, so orbits are strictly increasing — no cycles or fixed points",
      "For primes p, h(p) = p + 2, so primes advance by exactly 2",
      "Orbits of 1 and 3 merge at value 7 after 3 and 2 steps respectively",
      "Average growth τ(n) ~ log n means orbits grow slowly, making merges plausible",
      "The conjecture says there is essentially one eventual trajectory for all starting points"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #414 remains open. The conjecture that all orbits of h(n) = n + τ(n) eventually merge is supported by extensive computation and the slow, irregular growth of the divisor function, but no proof exists.",
    "implications": "A resolution would reveal the long-term dynamics of a natural arithmetic iteration, connecting divisor function regularity to orbit convergence in discrete dynamical systems.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "How quickly do orbits merge? What is the expected meeting time for orbits starting at m and n?",
      "Does the same hold for h(n) = n + σ(n) (sum of divisors) instead of n + τ(n)?",
      "Are there infinitely many values that lie on every eventual orbit?"
