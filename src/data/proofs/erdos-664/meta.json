    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #664 (Blocking Sets with Bounded Intersection)**\n\n**Origin:**\nErdős posed this problem in [Er81] (1981), asking whether near-linear set families (large sets with small pairwise intersection) always admit 'nice' blocking sets that intersect each set in O(1) points.\n\n**Motivation:**\nThis relates to blocking sets in finite geometries: can we find a blocking set (meeting every line) that doesn't concentrate on any single line?\n\n**Resolution:**\nNils Alon disproved the conjecture using a probabilistic construction based on projective planes. For n = q² + q + 1, random subsets of projective plane lines give families where any blocker must have logarithmically large intersection with some set.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet c < 1 and A₁,...,Aₘ ⊆ {1,...,n} with |Aᵢ| > c√n and |Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ| ≤ 1 for i ≠ j.\n\nMust there exist B such that B ∩ Aᵢ ≠ ∅ and |B ∩ Aᵢ| = O_c(1) for all i?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\n**Alon's Counterexample:**\nFor n = m = q² + q + 1 (q large prime), random subsets of projective plane lines give:\n- |Aᵢ| ≥ (2/5)√n\n- |Aᵢ ∩ Aⱼ| ≤ 1\n- Any blocker has |B ∩ Aⱼ| ≥ Ω(log n) for some j",
