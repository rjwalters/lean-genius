(The construction is to take random subsets of the lines of a projective plane.)\n\nThe weaker version that Erd\\H{o}s posed in \\cite{Er81} remains open, although Alon conjectures the answer there to also be no.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the combinatorial problems which I would most like to see solved.
