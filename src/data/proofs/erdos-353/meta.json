Must $A$ contain the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid of area $1$? What about an isosceles triangle, or a right-angled triangle, or a cyclic quadrilateral, or a polygon with congruent sides?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Mauldin (unpublished) claim that this is true for trapezoids in general, but fails for parallelograms (a construction showing this fails for parallelograms was provided by Kova\\v{c}) \\cite{Ko23}.\n\nKova\\v{c} and Predojevi\\'{c} \\cite{KoPr24} have proved that this is true for cyclic quadrilaterals - that is, every set with infinite measure contains four distinct points on a circle such that the quadrilateral determined by these four points has area $1$. They also prove that there exists a set of infinite measure such that every convex polygon with congruent sides and all vertices in the set has area $<1$.\n\nKoizumi \\cite{Ko25} has resolved this question, proving that any set with infinite measure must contain the vertices of an isosceles trapezoid, an isosceles triangle, and a right-angled triangle, all of area $1$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ko23] Kova\\vC, V., Coloring and density theorems for configurations of a given volume. arXiv:2309.09973 (2023).\n\n[Ko25] J.
