    "proofStrategy": "The resolution proceeds through several key insights:\n1. Define 'no small subgroups' property\n2. Show Lie groups have this property (via exponential map)\n3. Prove the converse: no small subgroups implies Lie structure\n4. Use Gleason's lemmas to construct local coordinates",
