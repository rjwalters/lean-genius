    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #550**\n\nThis problem was proposed by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp in 1985 [EFRS85] as a natural extension of Chvátal's fundamental 1977 result on tree-vs-complete-graph Ramsey numbers.\n\n**Foundation: Chvátal's Theorem (1977)**\n\nChvátal proved that for any tree T on n vertices and any complete graph Kₘ:\n$$R(T, K_m) = (m-1)(n-1) + 1$$\n\nThis is one of the few exact Ramsey results, giving the precise minimum N such that any 2-coloring of K_N contains either a red copy of T or a blue copy of Kₘ.\n\n**The Generalization**\n\nProblem #550 asks whether this elegant formula extends to complete multipartite graphs G = K_{m₁,...,mₖ} via a recursive bound involving the chromatic number χ(G) = k and the bipartite Ramsey number R(T, K_{m₁,m₂}).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nFor sufficiently large n, let $m_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq m_k$ and T be a tree on n vertices. If G is the complete multipartite graph K_{m₁,...,mₖ}, prove that:\n\n$$R(T,G) \\leq (\\chi(G)-1)(R(T,K_{m_1,m_2})-1)+m_1$$\n\nwhere χ(G) = k is the chromatic number (number of parts).\n\n**Current Status: OPEN**\n\nThis problem cannot be resolved with finite computation and remains one of the open questions in Ramsey theory for graphs.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Strategy**\n\n1. **Graph Foundations:** Define IsTree (connected + acyclic), vertex count, edge count properties\n\n2. **Multipartite Graphs:** Structure for K_{m₁,...,mₖ} with sorted part sizes and chromatic number = k\n\n3. **Ramsey Numbers:** Define R(T, G) as minimum N for guaranteed monochromatic embedding\n\n4. **Chvátal's Theorem:** Axiomatize the exact result R(T, Kₘ) = (m-1)(n-1)+1\n\n5. **The Conjecture:** Formalize the conjectured bound and state as axiom (since open)\n\n6. **Special Cases:** Complete graphs reduce to Chvátal; bipartite case; paths and stars\n\n7. **Related Results:** Burr's conjecture (proved), probabilistic bounds, asymptotics",
