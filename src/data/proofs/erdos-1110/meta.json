Yet the general problem remains deep and partially open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially OPEN)**\n\nLet p > q ≥ 2 be coprime. An integer n is representable if it equals a sum of terms p^k q^l where no term divides another.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. If {p,q} ≠ {2,3}, what is the density of non-representable numbers?\n2. Are there infinitely many coprime non-representable numbers?\n\n**Key Results:**\n- {2,3}: ALL positive integers are representable (simple induction)\n- Other cases: Infinitely many non-representable (Erdős-Lewin)\n- Density zero in many cases (Yu-Chen 2022)\n- Infinitely many coprime non-representables for most (p,q) (Yu-Chen)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** IsPowerForm, NoOneDividesAnother, IsRepresentable\n\n2. **The {2,3} Case:** Axiomatize that all n ≥ 1 are representable\n\n3. **Erdős-Lewin:** Axiomatize the characterization (finite exceptions ↔ {2,3})\n\n4. **Yu-Chen Results:** Density zero and coprime infinitude conditions\n\n5. **Minimum Summand Bounds:** f(n) ~ n/log n\n\n6. **Concrete Example:** Prove 1 is representable constructively",

The {2,3} case is completely solved (all positive integers representable), but general cases have infinitely many exceptions.
