Once it is done, he asked for the existence and value of\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{\\log f(n)}{n^{1/2}},\\]where $f(n)$ counts the number of line-compatible sequences.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Szemer\\'{e}di and Trotter \\cite{SzTr83}.\n\nSee also [732].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[SzTr83] Szemer\\'{e}di, Endre and Trotter, Jr., William T., Extremal problems in discrete geometry.
