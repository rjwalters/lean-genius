It follows that the contribution from $p\\leq n^{2/3}$ is at most\\[\\left(1+\\frac{\\log n}{n^{1/3}}\\right)^{\\log n}\\leq 1+o(1).\\]There is at most one $p\\mid n+1$ with $p\\geq n^{2/3}$ which (if present) contributes exactly\\[\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\frac{n+1}{p}}\\right).\\]We have proved the claim, since these two facts combined show that the ratio in question is either $1+o(1)$ or $1+1/k+o(1)$, the latter occurring if $n+1=pk$ for some $p>n^{2/3}$.\n\nAfter receiving Sawhney's argument I found that this had already been proved, with essentially the same argument, by Erd\\H{o}s, Graham, Ivi\\'{c}, and Pomerance \\cite{EGIP96}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGIP96] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Graham, S.
