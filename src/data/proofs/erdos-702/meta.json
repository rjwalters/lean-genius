    "historicalContext": "**Erdős-Sós Conjecture**\n\nErdős and Sós asked: for k ≥ 4, if a k-uniform family F has more than C(n-2, k-2) sets, must it contain two sets with exactly one common element?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Katona (unpublished): Proved for k = 4\n- Frankl (1977): Proved for all k ≥ 4\n\nThe bound is tight: all k-sets containing two fixed elements avoid singleton intersections.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet k ≥ 4. If F is a family of k-subsets of {1,...,n} with |F| > C(n-2, k-2), then there exist A, B ∈ F with |A ∩ B| = 1.\n\n**Answer: YES** (Frankl 1977)\n\nThe bound C(n-2, k-2) is tight.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Set families:** Define k-uniform families over ground set.\n2. **Intersection patterns:** SingletonIntersection as |A ∩ B| = 1.\n3. **Extremal bound:** C(n-2, k-2) from fixing two elements.\n4. **Frankl's theorem:** Axiomatize main result.\n5. **Failure for k=3:** Note the condition k ≥ 4 is necessary.",
