Does\\[\\lim \\frac{\\lvert S\\cap [1,x]\\rvert}{x}\\]exist? What is it?\n\nSimilarly, if $P$ is the set of all primes $p$ such that there exists an $m$ with $p\\not\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$ such that $m!+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{p}$, then does\\[\\lim \\frac{\\lvert P\\cap [1,x]\\rvert}{\\pi(x)}\\]exist? What is it?\n\n\n\nQuestions raised by Erd\\H{o}s, Hardy, and Subbarao, who called the set $S$ 'EHS numbers' and the set $P$ 'Pillai primes', and proved that both $S$ and $P$ are infinite. Pillai \\cite{Pi30} raised the question of whether there exist any primes in $P$. This was answered by Chowla, who noted that, for example,\\[14!+1\\equiv 18!+1\\equiv 0\\pmod{23}.\\]The sequence $S$ begins\\[8,9,13,14,15,16,17,\\ldots\\]and is A064164 in the OEIS. The sequence $P$ begins\\[23,29,59,61,67,71,\\ldots\\]and is A063980 in the OEIS.\n\nRegarding the first question, Hardy and Subbarao computed all EHS numbers up to $2^{10}$, and write '...if this trend conditions we expect [the limit] to be around $0.5$, if it exists. The frequency with which the EHS numbers occur - most often in long sequences of consecutive integers - makes us believe that their asymptotic density exists and is unity. Erd\\H{o}s, though initially hesitant, later agreed with this view.'\n\nRegarding the second question, they write '[from the data] it would appear that if the limit exists, it is perhaps between $0.5$ and $0.6$. But then there seems to be no reason why the ratio should not tend to $1$, even though very slowly and certainly not monotonically.'\n\nThis is discussed in problem A2 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
