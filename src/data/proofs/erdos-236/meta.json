  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects two fundamental themes in Erdős's work: the representation of integers as sums involving primes, and the asymptotic growth of counting functions. The question emerged from his 1950 paper on representing integers as 2^k + p, where he showed that infinitely many n cannot be written in this form. Problem #236 asks about the opposite extreme: how many ways can a given n be represented? Erdős's lower bound f(n) ≫ log log n infinitely often shows that representations can be surprisingly abundant. The related conjecture that only 7 numbers have ALL residues n - 2^k prime (the 'all-prime' property) has been verified to 2^44 by Mientka-Weitzenkamp.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) count the number of solutions to n = p + 2^k for prime p and k ≥ 0. Is it true that f(n) = o(log n)? Equivalently, does the ratio f(n)/log(n) tend to 0 as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the counting function f(n) computationally and state the main conjecture using Mathlib's asymptotic notation. Since the problem is OPEN, we use axioms for the main conjecture and known bounds. We prove concrete values f(2)=0, f(3)=1, f(5)=1 and verify the 'all-prime' property for small cases {4, 7} directly. The Erdős-Guy conjecture listing all 7 all-prime numbers and Vaughan's upper bound on their density are stated as axioms with proper attribution.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The trivial upper bound f(n) ≤ log₂(n) + 1 is immediate from the definition",
      "Erdős's lower bound f(n) ≫ log log n infinitely often shows the conjecture, if true, is essentially tight",
      "Numbers with the 'all-prime' property (n - 2^k prime for all valid k) are extremely rare",
      "Vaughan proved the all-prime numbers have density decaying faster than any polynomial",
      "This problem connects to Problem #10 (existence of representations) and #237 (related bounds)"
