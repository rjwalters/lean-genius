Is it true that $f(n)=o(\\log n)$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er50} proved that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $f(n)\\gg \\log\\log n$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s could not even prove that there do not exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that for all $1< 2^k<n$ the number $n-2^k$ is prime - he conjectured (see problem A19 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}) that\\[4,7,15,21,45,75,105\\]are the only such $n$. This is A039669 in the OEIS. Mientka and Weitzenkamp \\cite{MiWe69} have proved there are no other such $n\\leq 2^{44}$.\n\nVaughan \\cite{Va73} has proved that the number of $n\\leq N$ such that $n-2^k$ is prime for all $2^k<n$ is\\[< \\exp\\left(-c\\frac{\\log \\log \\log N}{\\log\\log N}\\log N\\right)N\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nThe sequence of values of $f(n)$ is A109925 on the OEIS.\n\nSee also [237].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er50] Erd\\\"{o}s, P., On integers of the form $2^k+p$ and some related problems.
