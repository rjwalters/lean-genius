    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1121 was proved by Goodman and Goodman in 1945. If circles form a 'connected' configuration (no separating line), they can be covered by a circle of radius equal to the sum of individual radii. This generalizes to higher dimensions.",
    "implications": "This result has applications in computational geometry and covering problems. The characterization of 'no separating line' provides a useful criterion for geometric configurations.",

      "What is the optimal center for the covering circle?",
