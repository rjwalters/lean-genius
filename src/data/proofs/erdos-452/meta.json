  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #452** concerns the distribution of integers with many prime factors. The function ω(n) counts distinct prime divisors. By the Hardy-Ramanujan theorem (1917), ω(n) is normally log log n. Erdős proved in 1937 that exactly half of all integers have ω(n) > log log n.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Hardy-Ramanujan (1917):** ω(n) ≈ log log n for most n\n- **Erdős (1937):** Density of {n : ω(n) > log log n} is exactly 1/2\n- **Erdős-Kac (1940):** Full Gaussian distribution for ω(n)\n- **This Problem:** How long can intervals be where ALL elements exceed log log n?\n\n**Key Insight:** While half of all integers satisfy the condition, they're not uniformly distributed. Primes have ω(p) = 1 < log log p, so they break valid intervals.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet $\\omega(n)$ count the number of distinct prime factors of $n$.\n\n**Question:** What is the size of the largest interval $I \\subseteq [x, 2x]$ such that $\\omega(n) > \\log\\log n$ for all $n \\in I$?\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: $|I| \\geq (1+o(1)) \\frac{\\log x}{(\\log\\log x)^2}$ via Chinese Remainder Theorem\n- Upper: Primes obstruct, so intervals must avoid all primes in [x, 2x]\n\n**Conjecture:** $|I| \\geq (\\log x)^k$ is achievable for arbitrarily large $k$.\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** omega (ω), satisfiesCondition, validInterval, maxValidIntervalLength\n\n2. **Foundational Results:** Hardy-Ramanujan, Erdős-Kac, Erdős 1937 density\n\n3. **Lower Bound:** CRT construction using primorials\n\n4. **Obstructions:** Primes fail the condition, limiting interval length\n\n5. **Main Conjecture:** Polynomial-length intervals should exist\n\n6. **Current State:** Problem remains open",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Density 1/2:** Erdős (1937) showed exactly half of integers have ω(n) > log log n. This follows from Erdős-Kac: the standardized ω(n) converges to Normal(0,1).",
      "**Prime Obstruction:** For primes p > 16, ω(p) = 1 < log log p ≈ 1+. So any valid interval must avoid all primes in [x, 2x].",
      "**CRT Construction:** To make ω(n) large, ensure n is divisible by many small primes. The CRT finds intervals of consecutive multiples of a primorial.",
      "**Gap Question:** The problem asks how long prime gaps can be avoided while maintaining the ω condition. This connects to prime gap theory.",
      "**Logarithmic vs Polynomial:** The known lower bound is log x/(log log x)², but the conjecture asks for (log x)^k—a huge gap.",
      "**Related to Primorials:** The primorial n# = 2·3·5·...·pₙ has ω(n#) = n. Numbers divisible by n# have many factors."
