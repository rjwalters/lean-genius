    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the largest gaps between consecutive primes. Rankin (1938) proved for some specific C > 0. Maynard (2016) and independently Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao (2016) proved it for ALL C > 0. The five authors then improved the bound in 2018.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that for any C > 0, there are infinitely many n such that p_{n+1} - p_n > C · (log log n · log log log log n) / (log log log n)² · log n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the n-th prime via Nat.nth, iterated logarithms (lg, lg2, lg3, lg4), and the Erdős function. The main conjecture and its solution are stated. Historical results from Rankin, Maynard, and FGKT are axiomatized. Upper bounds (Baker-Harman-Pintz) and related conjectures (Cramér, Firoozbakht) are included.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #4, a SOLVED problem asking whether for any C > 0, there are infinitely many large prime gaps exceeding C times a specific function of iterated logarithms. The answer is YES, proved independently by Maynard and Ford-Green-Konyagin-Tao in 2016.",
    "implications": "This result shows that prime gaps can be much larger than the average gap of log n. The Erdős function grows slower than (log n)^(1+ε) for any ε > 0, but large gaps exceeding it occur infinitely often. The exact growth rate of maximal prime gaps remains unknown.",
