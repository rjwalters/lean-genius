Selfridge reports numerical evidence which suggests the answer is no, but Erd\\H{o}s and Graham write 'it seems unlikely that anything can be proved about this in the near future'.\n\nSee also [413] and [414].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er79d] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some unconventional problems in number theory.
