  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was originally posed by Pólya in 1929. It asks about the relationship between the maximum and minimum modulus of entire functions with gap power series.\n\nA gap series f(z) = Σ aₖzⁿᵏ has many zero coefficients. The sequence (nₖ) records positions of nonzero terms. The Fabry gap condition nₖ/k → ∞ means gaps grow superlinearly.\n\nWiman (1914) proved a strong result under (nₖ₊₁ - nₖ)² > nₖ. Erdős and Macintyre (1954) weakened this to Σ 1/(nₖ₊₁ - nₖ) < ∞. Finally, Fuchs (1963) gave the complete solution for Fabry gaps.\n\nKovári (1965) extended the result to entire functions of infinite order under nₖ > k(log k)^{2+c}. The question of whether Fejér gaps (Σ 1/nₖ < ∞) suffice for arbitrary entire functions remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(z) = \\sum_{k \\geq 1} a_k z^{n_k}$ be an entire function of finite order such that $n_k/k \\to \\infty$ (Fabry gaps).\n\nLet $M(r) = \\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|$ and $m(r) = \\min_{|z|=r} |f(z)|$.\n\nIs it true that $\\limsup \\frac{\\log m(r)}{\\log M(r)} = 1$?\n\n**Answer**: YES (Fuchs 1963)\n\nMore precisely, for any ε > 0, log m(r) > (1-ε) log M(r) holds outside a set of logarithmic density 0.\n\n**Status**: SOLVED for finite order + Fabry gaps. OPEN for Fejér gaps.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem through several key definitions:\n\n1. **Gap conditions**: Define Fabry gaps (nₖ/k → ∞) and Fejér gaps (Σ 1/nₖ < ∞), and prove Fabry implies Fejér.\n\n2. **Entire functions of finite order**: Functions f with |f(z)| ≤ c·exp(|z|^a) for some constants c, a.\n\n3. **Modulus functions**: M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)| and m(r) = min_{|z|=r} |f(z)|.\n\n4. **Main theorems**: State Fuchs's theorem as an axiom (requires Nevanlinna theory beyond current Mathlib).\n\n5. **Historical results**: Include Wiman, Erdős-Macintyre, and Kovári theorems.\n\n6. **Open conjecture**: Formalize the remaining question about Fejér gaps.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Fabry gaps**: The condition nₖ/k → ∞ means nonzero terms become increasingly sparse. This forces the function to behave 'lacunary' - large gaps between terms.",
      "**Maximum vs Minimum modulus**: For most entire functions, m(r) can be much smaller than M(r). Gap series are special: the ratio of logarithms approaches 1.",
      "**Why logarithms?**: Wiman's original result had m(r)/M(r) → 1 under strong gaps. For weaker gaps, we only get (log m)/(log M) → 1.",
      "**Fejér gaps**: The weaker condition Σ 1/nₖ < ∞ is conjectured to suffice. Macintyre showed this would be optimal - counterexamples exist when Σ 1/nₖ = ∞.",
      "**Nevanlinna theory**: Fuchs's proof uses deep results from value distribution theory, which is not yet formalized in Mathlib."
