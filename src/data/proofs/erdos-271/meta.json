How fast do they grow?\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that $A(1)$ is the set of integers which have no 2 in their base 3 expansion. Odlyzko and Stanley \\cite{OdSt78} have found similar characterisations are known for $A(3^k)$ and $A(2\\cdot 3^k)$ for any $k\\geq 0$ and conjectured in general that such a sequence always eventually either satisfies\\[a_k\\asymp k^{\\log_23}\\]or\\[a_k \\asymp \\frac{k^2}{\\log k}.\\]There is no known sequence which satisfies the second growth rate, but Lindhurst \\cite{Li90} gives data which suggests that $A(4)$ has such growth ($A(4)$ is given as A005487 in the OEIS).\n\nMoy \\cite{Mo11} has proved that, for all such sequences, for all $\\epsilon>0$, $a_k\\leq (\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon)k^2$ for all sufficiently large $k$. van Doorn and Sothanaphan have noted in the comment section that Moy's proof can be upgraded to give a fully explicit result of\\[a_k\\leq \\frac{(k-1)(k+2)}{2}+n\\]for all $k\\geq 0$.\n\nIn general, sequences which begin with some initial segment and thereafter are continued in a greedy fashion to avoid three-term arithmetic progressions are known as Stanley sequences.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Li90] S.
