  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Riemann Hypothesis was first stated by Bernhard Riemann in 1859 in his paper 'On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude.' It concerns the location of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, which Riemann showed are intimately connected to the distribution of prime numbers.\n\nIn 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute designated RH as one of seven Millennium Prize Problems, offering $1 million for its resolution. As of 2025, it remains one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics.\n\nKey milestones:\n- 1859: Riemann states the hypothesis\n- 1896: Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin prove the Prime Number Theorem\n- 1914: Hardy proves infinitely many zeros lie on the critical line\n- 1942: Selberg proves a positive proportion of zeros are on the critical line\n- 2004: First 10^13 zeros verified computationally",
    "problemStatement": "**The Riemann Hypothesis**: All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function\n\n$$\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^s}$$\n\nhave real part equal to 1/2.\n\nFormally: If $\\zeta(s) = 0$ and $0 < \\text{Re}(s) < 1$, then $\\text{Re}(s) = 1/2$.\n\nThe 'trivial zeros' at $s = -2, -4, -6, \\ldots$ are excluded; these follow from the functional equation.",
    "proofStrategy": "This file does NOT prove the Riemann Hypothesis. Instead, we:\n\n1. **State RH precisely** using Mathlib's `riemannZeta` function\n2. **State key equivalences**:\n   - Robin's inequality: $\\sigma(n) < e^\\gamma n \\log\\log n$ for $n > 5040$\n   - Mertens bound: $M(x) = O(x^{1/2+\\epsilon})$\n   - Prime counting: $|\\pi(x) - \\text{Li}(x)| = O(\\sqrt{x} \\log x)$\n3. **State partial results**:\n   - Hardy: infinitely many zeros on Re(s) = 1/2\n   - Selberg/Conrey: >40% of zeros on critical line\n   - Zero-free region: Re(s) > 1 - c/log|t|\n4. **Document computational verification**: First 10^13 zeros verified",
