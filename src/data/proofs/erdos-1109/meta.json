Estimate $f(N)$. In particular, is it true that $f(N)\\leq N^{o(1)}$, or even $f(N) \\leq (\\log N)^{O(1)}$?\n\n\n\nFirst studied by Erd\\H{o}s and S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy \\cite{ErSa87}, who proved\\[\\log N \\ll f(N) \\ll N^{3/4}\\log N,\\]and guessed the lower bound is nearer the truth. S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy \\cite{Sa92c} extended this to consider the case of $A+B$ and also looking for sumsets which are $k$-power-free.\n\nGyarmati \\cite{Gy01} gave an alternative proof of $f(N)\\gg \\log N$, and also gave new bounds for the case of $A+B$. Konyagin \\cite{Ko04} improved this to\\[ \\log\\log N(\\log N)^2\\ll f(N) \\ll N^{11/15+o(1)}.\\]The infinite analogue of this problem is [1103]. (In particular upper bounds for this $f(N)$ directly imply lower bounds for the size of the $a_j$ considered there.)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErSa87] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and S\\'ark\\\"ozy, A., On divisibility properties of integers of the form {$a+a'$}.
