  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős studied distinct distances under general-position conditions starting in the 1970s. Without restrictions, Guth–Katz proved Ω(n/log n) distances. With no 3 collinear and no 4 concyclic, more distances should be forced, but even h(n) ≥ n is not proved.",
    "problemStatement": "For n points in ℝ² with no 3 collinear and no 4 concyclic, does the minimum number of distinct distances h(n) satisfy h(n)/n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "Defines general-position conditions (no 3 collinear, no 4 concyclic), distinct distances, and h(n). States Pach's n^{log₂3} bound, the EFP n·exp(c√(log n)) bound, the main conjecture h(n)/n → ∞, and the weaker h(n) ≥ n question.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "General position (no 3 collinear, no 4 concyclic) prevents lattice-like low-distance configurations",
      "Pach's upper bound h(n) < n^{log₂3} shows h(n) is at most slightly superlinear",
      "The EFP improvement h(n) < n·exp(c√log n) is much closer to linear",
      "Even proving h(n) ≥ n (let alone h(n)/n → ∞) remains open"
