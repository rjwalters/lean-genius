  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about sets with pairwise large LCMs. Schinzel and Szekeres (1959) proved the bound 31/30, achieved by {2,3,5}. Chen (1996) improved the bound for large n. The remaining conjecture about maximal sets achieving sum > 1 is still open.",
    "problemStatement": "If A ⊆ {1,...,n} satisfies lcm(a,b) > n for all distinct a,b ∈ A, must ∑_{a ∈ A} 1/a ≤ 31/30?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the pairwise LCM condition and reciprocal sum, state the Schinzel-Szekeres theorem, Chen's stronger bound for large n, and the maximal sets conjecture. We prove structural properties including singleton validity and reciprocal sum formulas.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The bound 31/30 is tight: {2,3,5} achieves equality with 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 = 31/30",
      "The LCM condition prevents any element from dividing another within {1,...,n}",
      "Chen's 1996 bound 1/3+1/4+1/5+1/7+1/11 applies for n > 172509",
      "Only {2,3,5} and {3,4,5,7,11} are conjectured to achieve sum > 1"
