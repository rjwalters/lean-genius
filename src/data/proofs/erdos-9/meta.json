  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the representation of odd integers as p + 2^k + 2^l where p is prime. Erdős asked whether the set A of odd integers WITHOUT such a representation has positive upper density.\n\nSchinzel proved A is infinite (credited by Erdős in 1977). Crocker (1971) showed at least log log N such integers exist up to N. Pan (2011) dramatically improved this to N^{1-ε} for any ε > 0.\n\nErdős made the key observation that covering systems cannot resolve this problem - integers of the form p + 2^k + 2^l exist in every arithmetic progression.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question (Erdős, OPEN):** Let A be the set of odd integers not of the form p + 2^k + 2^l. Is the upper density of A positive?\n\n**Known bounds:**\n- Schinzel: A is infinite\n- Crocker (1971): |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≫ log log N\n- Pan (2011): |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≫ N^{1-ε} for any ε > 0\n- Question: |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≫ N (positive density)?\n\n**First elements of A (OEIS A006286):** 1, 127, 149, 251, 331, 337, 373, ...",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `HasPrimePlusTwoPowersForm n`: n = p + 2^k + 2^l for some prime p\n2. `A`: odd integers without such representation\n3. `upperDensity A`: the upper asymptotic density\n4. `erdos_9_question`: is upperDensity A > 0?\n\nWe axiomatize:\n- Schinzel's result: A is infinite\n- Crocker (1971): ≫ log log N bound\n- Pan (2011): ≫ N^{1-ε} bound\n- Erdős's observation on covering systems",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Covering systems fail:** Erdős observed that p + 2^k + 2^l hits every arithmetic progression, so covering system methods cannot prove positive density.",
      "**Pan's near-linear bound:** The N^{1-ε} bound is tantalizingly close to linear but doesn't prove positive density. The gap between N^{1-ε} and N is the key difficulty.",
      "**Small exceptions are rare:** Only 1, 127, 149, ... are exceptional. Most odd integers CAN be written as p + 2^k + 2^l, making exceptions sparse.",
      "**Related to Romanoff's theorem:** Romanoff (1934) proved a positive proportion of integers are p + 2^k. This problem extends to p + 2^k + 2^l for odd integers.",
      "**OEIS A006286:** The sequence of exceptional odd integers is catalogued and grows very slowly."
