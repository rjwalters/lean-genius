    "problemStatement": "Let $A$ be the set of all odd integers not of the form $p+2^{k}+2^l$ (where $k,l\\geq 0$ and $p$ is prime). Is the upper density of $A$ positive? In [Er77c] Erdős credits Schinzel with proving that there are infinitely many odd integers not of this form, but gives no reference. Crocker [Cr71] has proved there are $\\gg\\log\\log N$ such integers in $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$. Pan [Pa11] improved this to $\\gg_\\epsilon N^{1-\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. Erdős believed this cannot be proved by covering systems, i.e. integers of the form $p+2^k+2^l$ exist in every infinite arithmetic progression. The sequence of such numbers is A006286 in the OEIS. See also [10], [11], and [16]. This is discussed in problem A19 of Guy's collection [Gu04]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 December 2025.",
