    "historicalContext": "Named after John Pell (1611-1685), though studied earlier by Brahmagupta and Bhaskara II. Lagrange gave the first complete existence proof in 1766-1769. Fermat famously challenged mathematicians with x^2 - 61y^2 = 1.",
    "problemStatement": "**Pell's Equation**:\n\nFor any positive integer $D$ that is not a perfect square, the equation\n$$x^2 - Dy^2 = 1$$\nhas infinitely many integer solutions, all generated from a unique fundamental solution $(x_1, y_1)$ by the recurrence $x_n + y_n\\sqrt{D} = (x_1 + y_1\\sqrt{D})^n$.",
    "proofStrategy": "Use the theory of continued fractions and Dirichlet's approximation theorem to establish existence. The multiplicative group structure in Z[sqrt(D)] shows all solutions are powers of the fundamental.",
