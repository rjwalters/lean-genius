  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A **Sidon set** (or B₂ sequence) is a set where all pairwise sums are distinct. Equivalently, all non-zero differences are distinct. For a 4-element Sidon set, the difference set B - B has exactly 13 elements (including 0).\n\nErdős asked: if every 4-element subset of A has 'almost' this property (|B - B| ≥ 11, missing at most one pair of differences), must A contain a large Sidon subset?\n\nErdős and Sós first proved c ≥ 1/2. Gyárfás and Lehel (1995) improved this to strict bounds:\n- **Lower bound**: c > 1/2 (greedy construction)\n- **Upper bound**: c < 3/5 (Fibonacci numbers as counterexample)\n\nThe exact value of c remains OPEN.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ be a set of size $n$ such that every subset $B \\subseteq A$ with $|B| = 4$ has $|B - B| \\geq 11$.\n\n**Question**: What is the best constant $c > 0$ such that $A$ must always contain a Sidon set of size $\\geq cn$?\n\n**Known bounds** (Gyárfás-Lehel 1995):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} < c < \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\n**Interpretation**: For any 4 elements in $A$, at most one difference 'collides' with another. The question asks how large a 'fully Sidon' subset can be guaranteed.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Sidon sets**: A set where a + b = c + d implies {a,b} = {c,d}\n\n2. **Almost-Sidon property**: Every 4-element subset has |B - B| ≥ 11\n\n3. **Admissible constants**: Values c such that almost-Sidon sets contain Sidon subsets of size ≥ cn\n\n4. **Main conjecture**: Find sSup{c : IsAdmissible c}\n\n5. **Known bounds**: Axiomatize Gyárfás-Lehel results\n\n6. **Properties**: Sidon subsets, difference set structure, connection to extremal problems",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Why |B - B| = 13 for Sidon 4-sets**: A 4-element set has 6 pairs, giving 12 non-zero differences (±), plus 0.",
      "**Why 11 is special**: Requiring |B - B| ≥ 11 means at most one collision among 4 elements—a minimal relaxation of Sidon.",
      "**Fibonacci counterexample**: The first n Fibonacci numbers form an almost-Sidon set with largest Sidon subset of size just under 3n/5.",
      "**Greedy lower bound**: A greedy algorithm constructs Sidon subsets of size > n/2, proving c > 1/2.",
      "**Open gap**: The exact value of c in (1/2, 3/5) remains unknown despite 30+ years of study."
