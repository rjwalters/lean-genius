Find the best constant $c>0$ such that $A$ must always contain a Sidon set of size $\\geq cn$.\n\n\n\nFor comparison, note that if $B$ were a Sidon set then $\\lvert B-B\\rvert=13$, so this condition is saying that at most one difference is 'missing' from $B-B$. Equivalently, one can view $A$ as a set such that every four points determine at least five distinct distances, and ask for a subset with all distances distinct.\n\nWithout loss of generality, one can assume $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and S\\'{o}s proved that $c\\geq 1/2$. Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s and Lehel \\cite{GyLe95} proved\\[\\frac{1}{2}<c<\\frac{3}{5}.\\](The example proving the upper bound is the set of the first $n$ Fibonacci numbers.)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GyLe95] Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Andr\\'{a}s and Lehel, Jen\\H{o}, Linear sets with five distinct differences among any four\nelements.
