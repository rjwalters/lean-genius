  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Counting antichains in the power set of [n] is a classical problem going back to Dedekind (1897). Sperner (1928) proved the maximum antichain size is C(n, ⌊n/2⌋). Kleitman (1969) determined the logarithmic order of the total count of antichains, solving Erdős's problem.",
    "problemStatement": "How many antichains (Sperner families) exist in the power set of [n]?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines antichains in P([n]) and the antichain count. Sperner's theorem and the maximum antichain are axiomatised. Kleitman's asymptotic formula is stated as the main result.",
    "keyInsights": [
