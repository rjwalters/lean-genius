  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Heilbronn originally posed the problem of estimating the minimum triangle area in n-point configurations. Erdős observed the 1/n² lower bound via greedy placement. The problem has seen dramatic progress: Komlós, Pintz, and Szemerédi improved both bounds in the 1980s, and Cohen, Pohoata, and Zakharov achieved the current best upper bound in 2024.",
    "problemStatement": "Let α(n) be the largest value such that every set of n points in the unit disk contains three points forming a triangle of area ≤ α(n). Estimate α(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the Heilbronn function, state the trivial bounds, the KPS logarithmic improvement to the lower bound, and the successive upper bound improvements from 1/n^{8/7} to 1/n^{7/6+o(1)}.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The greedy argument gives α(n) ≫ 1/n², improved to (log n)/n² by KPS",
      "The trivial upper bound 1/n was improved to 1/n^{8/7} using regularity",
      "Cohen–Pohoata–Zakharov (2024) achieved 1/n^{7/6+o(1)} via incidence geometry",
      "The true exponent β lies in [7/6, 2] — the gap is still enormous",
      "Higher-dimensional analogs are even less understood"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Heilbronn's triangle problem asks for the minimum unavoidable triangle area in n-point configurations. The best bounds are (log n)/n² ≪ α(n) ≪ 1/n^{7/6+o(1)}, leaving a large gap. The problem remains open.",
    "implications": "Closing the gap would resolve a fundamental question in combinatorial geometry, connecting to incidence geometry, the polynomial method, and probabilistic combinatorics.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the true exponent β in α(n) = n^{-β+o(1)}?",
      "Can the lower bound be improved beyond (log n)/n²?",
      "Can the upper bound exponent be pushed beyond 7/6?",
      "What are the optimal bounds in higher dimensions?"
