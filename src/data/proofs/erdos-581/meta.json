    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #581: Bipartite Subgraphs**\n\nThis problem asks: how many edges can we guarantee in a bipartite subgraph of any triangle-free graph?\n\n**Background:**\n- Any graph with m edges has a bipartite subgraph with at least m/2 edges (trivial)\n- The question is: does triangle-freeness help?\n\n**Resolution (Alon 1996):**\nYes! Alon proved:\n  m/2 + c₁·m^{4/5} ≤ f(m) ≤ m/2 + c₂·m^{4/5}\n\nTriangle-free graphs are 'more bipartite' by Θ(m^{4/5}) edges.\n\n**Reference:**\nAlon, Noga. 'Bipartite subgraphs.'

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #581 is SOLVED. Alon (1996) determined f(m) = m/2 + Θ(m^{4/5}), where f(m) is the guaranteed bipartite subgraph size in any triangle-free graph with m edges. This shows triangle-free graphs are 'more bipartite' than general graphs by a factor of m^{4/5}.",
    "implications": "**Graph-Theoretic Significance**\n\n1. **Structural Property:** Triangle-free graphs have inherent bipartite-like structure\n\n2. **Extremal Graph Theory:** Connects to Turán-type problems\n\n3. **Probabilistic Methods:** Alon's proof showcases powerful probabilistic techniques\n\n4. **Tight Bounds:** Both upper and lower bounds match, giving precise asymptotics",
