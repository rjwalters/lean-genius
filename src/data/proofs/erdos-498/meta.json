  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Littlewood–Offord problem originated in the 1940s when Littlewood and Offord asked how many signed sums of complex numbers can fall near a given point. Erdős (1945) gave the sharp answer C(n,⌊n/2⌋) for real numbers using Sperner's theorem. The complex case required Kleitman's breakthrough in 1965.",
    "problemStatement": "Given complex z₁,...,zₙ with |zᵢ| ≥ 1 and any disc D of radius 1 in ℂ, prove that at most C(n,⌊n/2⌋) of the 2ⁿ signed sums Σ εᵢzᵢ (εᵢ ∈ {±1}) lie in D.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define signed sums and disc containment, state Kleitman's sharp bound, and record the historical progression: Erdős's real case (1945), weak complex bound (1961), and Kleitman's resolution (1965) with Hilbert space generalization (1970).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Erdős (1945) proved the real case using Sperner's theorem",
      "Erdős (1961) obtained O(2ⁿ/√n) for complex numbers",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #498 asked whether the Littlewood–Offord bound C(n,⌊n/2⌋) extends from real to complex numbers. Kleitman proved this in 1965 using antichain methods, and later generalized to Hilbert spaces. The bound is tight and connects to Sperner's theorem.",
