    "summary": "Erdős Problem #613 is DISPROVED. The original conjecture that graphs with C(2n+1,2) - C(n,2) - 1 edges decompose into bipartite + bounded-degree is FALSE for n ≥ 5. Pikhurko established asymptotic bounds showing the true size Ramsey number differs by Θ(n^{3/2}). Tao formalized the n=5 counterexample in Lean, making this one of the first formally verified Erdős disproofs.",
