    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this question about Sidon sets with disjoint difference sets, offering a $100 bounty. Tao proved partial results for the equal-size case, and Barreto showed the equal-size strengthening with a constant improvement factor is false.",

    "proofStrategy": "We define IsSidonSet, diffSet, DisjointDifferences, and axiomatize maxSidonSize with the asymptotic f(N) ~ √N. ErdosProblem43 states the main bound. The EqualSizeVariant (with constant improvement) is stated and shown false by Barreto. Combined pair bounds are axiomatized.",
