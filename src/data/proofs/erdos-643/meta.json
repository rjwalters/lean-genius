    "historicalContext": "This problem belongs to extremal hypergraph theory, asking about the minimum number of edges that forces a specific forbidden configuration.\n\nThe 'crossed pair' configuration—four edges A,B,C,D where A∪B = C∪D but the pairs {A,B} and {C,D} are both disjoint—generalizes the concept of a 4-cycle in graphs. For ordinary graphs (t=2), avoiding crossed pairs is equivalent to avoiding C₄, connecting to the classical Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem.\n\nFor hypergraphs (t≥3), the problem becomes much more subtle. The natural construction is a 'sunflower': all edges share a common (t-1)-element core, with distinct single elements (petals) distinguishing them. This gives about C(n-1,t-1) edges.\n\nSignificant progress was made by Pikhurko and Verstraëte (2009) for 3-uniform hypergraphs, establishing f(n,3) ≤ (13/9)·C(n,2).\n\nThe conjecture that f(n,t) ~ C(n,t-1) would show that sunflower-type constructions are essentially optimal.",

    "proofStrategy": "Our formalization:\n\n1. **Defines hypergraphs** as sets of Finsets with uniformity constraints\n\n2. **Formalizes the crossed pair configuration** with four edges having matching unions and empty intersections\n\n3. **Defines the extremal function** f(n,t) via Nat.find on the property that all hypergraphs with ≥m edges contain a crossed pair\n\n4. **Explores the t=2 case** connecting to 4-cycles and the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem\n\n5. **Records known bounds** including the Pikhurko-Verstraëte upper bound\n\n6. **Constructs sunflower hypergraphs** as examples achieving near-optimal bounds\n\n7. **States the main conjecture** as an asymptotic limit statement",
