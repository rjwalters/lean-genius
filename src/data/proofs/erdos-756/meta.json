Can there be $\\gg n$ many distinct distances each of which occurs for more than $n$ many pairs from $A$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Pach in the stronger form of whether all distances (aside from the largest) can occur with multiplicity $>n$. Hopf and Pannowitz \\cite{HoPa34} proved that the largest distance between points of $A$ can occur at most $n$ times, but it is unknown whether a second such distance must occur (see [132]).\n\nThe answer is yes: Bhowmick \\cite{Bh24} constructs a set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\\lfloor\\frac{n}{4}\\rfloor$ distances occur at least $n+1$ times. More generally, they construct, for any $m$ and large $n$, a set of $n$ points such that $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2(m+1)}\\rfloor$ distances occur at least $n+m$ times.\n\nFurther investigations were undertaken by Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu \\cite{CDL25}, who proved, amongst other results, that if we take $A$ to be the square grid of $n$ points, then there are at least $n^{c/\\log\\log n}$ many distances which occur with multiplicity at least $n^{1+c/\\log\\log n}$ (for some constant $c>0$).\n\nSee also [132] and [957].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bh24] K.
