    "summary": "Erdős Problem #756 (Rich Distances) asked whether ≫n distinct distances can each occur >n times among n points in the plane. Bhowmick (2024) proved YES: there exist n-point sets with ⌊n/4⌋ 'rich' distances (each occurring ≥ n+1 times). The only constraint is Hopf-Pannwitz (1934): the largest distance must occur ≤ n times.",
    "implications": "**Discrete Geometry**\n\n1. **Rich Distance Phenomenon:** Many distances can exceed the n-occurrence threshold\n\n2. **Hopf-Pannwitz is Tight:** Only the largest distance is constrained\n\n3. **Explicit Constructions:** Bhowmick provides geometric constructions\n\n4. **Grid Structure:** Square grids exhibit super-polynomial rich behavior\n\n5. **Connection to Unit Distance:** Related to Erdős Problem #132",
