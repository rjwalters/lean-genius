  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects three fundamental graph invariants: edge count, chromatic number, and triangle existence. Turán's theorem (1941) completely solved the case r=2. Erdős and Gallai (1962) determined f_3(n). Simonovits's PhD thesis established the asymptotic form involving g(r). Recent work by Davies-Illingworth (2022) and Hefty-Horn-King-Pfender (2025) narrowed the bounds on g(r) to within a factor of 4.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f_r(n) be minimal such that every graph on n vertices with at least f_r(n) edges and chromatic number at least r contains a triangle. Determine f_r(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines f_r(n) as a threshold function on graphs with chromatic number constraints. Known exact values for r=2,3,4 are stated as axioms. The Simonovits asymptotic f_r(n) = n²/4 - g(r)n/2 + O(1) introduces the key quantity g(r). Bounds on g(r) capture current knowledge: (1/2)r² log r ≤ g(r) ≤ 2r² log r.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The threshold f_r(n) for forcing triangles in graphs with chromatic number ≥ r is well-understood for small r but the general asymptotic remains open. Simonovits showed f_r(n) = n²/4 - g(r)n/2 + O(1) where g(r) captures how far triangle-free χ≥r graphs are from bipartite. Current bounds show g(r) ~ r² log r with a factor-of-4 gap in the constant.",
    "implications": "This connects extremal graph theory (Turán-type problems) with chromatic theory. Understanding g(r) would reveal how chromatic number constrains triangle-free graphs. The recent progress on R(3,k) (the Ramsey number) directly impacts the upper bound on g(r).",
