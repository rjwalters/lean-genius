  "description": "Are there only finitely many powers of 2 whose base-3 representation uses only digits 0 and 1? Known: 1, 4, 256. Saye verified no new examples for 2^n with n ≤ 5.9×10²¹.",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the intersection of powers of 2 and numbers expressible with only digits 0 and 1 in base 3 (sums of distinct powers of 3). Only three examples are known: 1, 4, and 256. The problem connects multiplication (powers of 2) with additive structure (base-3 representations) and is notoriously difficult.",
    "problemStatement": "Is the set {2^k : all base-3 digits of 2^k are 0 or 1} finite? A variant asks whether 2^15 is the largest power of 2 with only digits 1 and 2 in base 3.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines digit predicates HasOnlyDigits01Base3 and HasOnlyDigits12Base3 via Nat.digits, constructs the relevant sets, states finiteness as the main conjecture, and records the three known examples, the variant conjecture, and Saye's massive computational verification.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Only three powers of 2 are known to have only digits 0 and 1 in base 3: 1, 4, 256",
      "Numbers with only ternary digits 0 and 1 are exactly sums of distinct powers of 3",
      "Saye (2022) checked all 2^n for n up to 5.9×10²¹ — none have this property for n ≥ 16",
      "The variant with digits 1 and 2 conjectures that 2^15 = 32768 is the largest"
