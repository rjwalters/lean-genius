  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Covering systems have been central to Erdős's work in combinatorial number theory. This problem asks about a special kind of covering system using divisors of n with a 'disjointness' constraint. Erdős and Graham believed no such n exists, and this was recently confirmed by Adenwalla in 2025.",
    "problemStatement": "For n > 1, can we assign residues a_d to each proper divisor d | n such that: (1) every integer is covered by some residue class, and (2) if an integer belongs to two residue classes mod d and mod d', then gcd(d, d') = 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "The key insight is that divisibility among divisors forces overlaps. If d | d', then gcd(d, d') = d > 1, but covering all integers requires using such pairs. Adenwalla's proof shows this obstruction is universal - no n can satisfy both conditions.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A 'disjoint' covering requires overlaps only for coprime moduli",
      "Divisibility structure of n's divisors forces non-coprime overlaps",
      "The density of such n (if any existed) would be zero",
      "Adenwalla (2025) proved: no such n exists at all",
      "Also studied: maximizing density for general n with disjointness constraint"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #204 is SOLVED. Adenwalla (2025) proved that no n admits a 'disjoint' covering system by its divisors, confirming the Erdős-Graham conjecture. The key obstruction is that divisibility among divisors forces overlaps between non-coprime pairs.",
    "implications": "This result deepens our understanding of covering systems. The constraint of 'disjointness' (overlaps only for coprime moduli) is incompatible with the covering requirement when using divisors. Related problems about maximizing covered density remain of interest.",
