Erd\\H{o}s and Graham believed that no such $n$ exist.\n\nAdenwalla \\cite{Ad25} has proved there are no such $n$.\n\nIn general, for any $n$ one can try to choose such $a_d$ to maximise the density of integers so covered, and ask what this density is. This was also investigated by Adenwalla \\cite{Ad25}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ad25] S.
