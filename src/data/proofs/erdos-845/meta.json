Is it true that the set of integers of the form\\[n=b_1+\\cdots+b_t\\textrm{ with }b_1<\\cdots<b_t\\]where $b_i=2^{k_i}3^{l_i}$ for $1\\leq i\\leq t$ and $b_t\\leq Cb_1$ has density $0$?\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er92b} Erd\\H{o}s wrote 'last year I made the following silly conjecture': every integer $n$ can be written as the sum of distinct integers of the form $2^k3^l$, none of which divide any other. 'I mistakenly thought that this was a nice and difficult conjecture but Jansen and several others found a simple proof by induction.'\n\nIndeed, one proves (by induction) the stronger fact that such a representation always exists, and moreover if $n$ is even then all the summands can be taken to be even (this is actually not stronger, see the comment by marinov): if $n=2m$ we are done applying the inductive hypothesis to $m$. Otherwise if $n$ is odd then let $3^k$ be the largest power of $3$ which is $\\leq n$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to $n-3^k$ (which is even).\n\nvan Doorn and Everts \\cite{vDEv25} have disproved this with $C=6$ - in fact, they prove that all integers can be written as such a sum in which $b_t<6b_1$.\n\nIf $C$ is the smallest constant for which all large integers can be written as such a sum with $b_t<Cb_1$ then Erd\\H{o}s and Lewin \\cite{ErLe96} show that $C>2$, and van Doorn and Everts \\cite{vDEv25} show that $C\\geq 3$. In the comments Alexeev and Cambie give evidence that perhaps any $C>3^{10}/2^{14}\\approx 3.604$ suffices.\n\nSee also [123] and [1110].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er92b] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some of my favourite problems in various branches of combinatorics.
