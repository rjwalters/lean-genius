    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1115** concerns asymptotic curves for entire functions, originally posed by Hayman (1960) but attributed to Erdős in some sources.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1960:** Hayman proves that if log M(r) ≪ (log r)², then f → ∞ along a ray (ℓ(r) = r)\n- **1974:** Hayman's book lists this as Problem 2.41, attributed to Erdős\n- **1979:** Gol'dberg-Eremenko DISPROVE the general question\n- They show: for ANY φ(r) → ∞, there exist entire functions with log M(r) ≪ φ(r)(log r)² where NO path has ℓ(r) ≪ r\n\n**Key Insight:** The threshold (log r)² is exact. Below it, straight rays to infinity exist. Above it, the function can force paths to wind excessively.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet f(z) be an entire function of finite order, and let Γ be a rectifiable path on which f(z) → ∞. Let ℓ(r) be the length of Γ in the disc |z| < r.\n\nFind a path for which ℓ(r) grows as slowly as possible, and estimate ℓ(r) in terms of M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|.\n\n**In particular:** Can such a path Γ always be found with ℓ(r) ≪ r?\n\n**Status:** DISPROVED (Gol'dberg-Eremenko 1979)\n\n**The answer is NO:** counterexamples exist even for functions of any prescribed finite order.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Strategy**\n\n1. **Positive Result (Hayman 1960):** If log M(r) ≪ (log r)², the function grows so slowly that a straight ray works as a path to infinity.\n\n2. **Counterexamples (Gol'dberg-Eremenko 1979):** For any growth function φ(r) → ∞, construct entire f with:\n   - log M(r) ≪ φ(r)(log r)² (barely above Hayman's threshold)\n   - No path Γ exists with both f → ∞ and ℓ(r) ≪ r\n\n3. **Construction Idea:** The counterexamples have oscillating behavior that forces any path to infinity to wind around many times, accumulating path length faster than linear.\n\n4. **Order Flexibility:** Such counterexamples exist for ANY prescribed finite order ρ > 0.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Critical Threshold:** log M(r) ≪ (log r)² is the exact boundary between ray-possible and ray-impossible cases.",
      "**Hayman's Positive Result:** Below the threshold, f → ∞ along a straight ray with ℓ(r) = r.",
      "**Counterexample Flexibility:** For ANY φ(r) → ∞, counterexamples exist slightly above the threshold.",
      "**Order Independence:** Counterexamples exist for any prescribed finite order ρ > 0.",
      "**Winding Behavior:** The counterexample functions force paths to wind excessively around the origin.",
      "**Wiman-Valiron Connection:** The theory of entire functions near maximum modulus points is key to understanding the counterexamples."
