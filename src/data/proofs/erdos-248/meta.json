Erd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{ErGr80} write 'we just know too little about sieves to be able to handle such a question (\"we\" here means not just us but the collective wisdom (?) of our poor struggling human race).'\n\nSee also [679] and [826].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\nThis has been resolved by Tao and Ter\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{TaTe25}, who have proved that there exists an absolute constant $C>0$ such that for infinitely many $n$, for all $k\\geq 1$,\\[\\omega(n+k)\\leq Ck.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
