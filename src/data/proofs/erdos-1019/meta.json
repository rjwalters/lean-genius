Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+\\lfloor \\frac{n+1}{2}\\rfloor$ edges contain a saturated planar graph with $>3$ vertices?\n\n\n\nA saturated planar graph on $3$ vertices is a triangle, which by Tur\\'{a}n's theorem is contained in every graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+1$ edges. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er71} writes it is 'easy to construct' a graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ edges which contains no saturated planar graph with $>3$ vertices.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er69c} proved that every graph with $n$ vertices and $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+k$ edges contains a saturated planar graph on $\\gg k/n$ vertices, answering a question of Dirac.\n\nThis was proved in the affirmative by Simonovits in his PhD thesis - indeed, it must contain either a $K_4$ or $C_l+2K_1$ for some $l\\geq 3$. The proof is given by Cambie in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er69c] Erd\\H{o}s, P., \\\"Uber die in {G}raphen enthaltenen saturierten planaren\n{G}raphen. Math. Nachr.
