    "historicalContext": "**Planar Graphs and Density**\n\nSaturated planar graphs are maximal planar graphs with exactly 3n - 6 edges. The smallest is K₃ (a triangle) on 3 vertices.\n\n**Turán Connection**: By Turán's theorem, any graph with more than n²/4 edges contains a triangle. Erdős asked what happens with more edges.\n\n**The Construction**: Erdős showed graphs with ⌊n²/4⌋ + ⌊(n-1)/2⌋ edges can avoid saturated planar subgraphs larger than triangles. But adding one more edge forces structure.\n\n**Resolution**: Simonovits proved in his PhD thesis that the threshold ⌊n²/4⌋ + ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ forces K₄ or C_l + 2K₁.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nA saturated planar graph on n vertices has exactly 3n - 6 edges (the maximum for planarity). Does every graph on n vertices with ⌊n²/4⌋ + ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ edges contain a saturated planar subgraph with more than 3 vertices?\n\n**Status**: SOLVED (Simonovits)\n\n**Answer**: YES. Such graphs must contain either K₄ or C_l + 2K₁ (cycle with 2 apex vertices).\n\n**Note**: The threshold is tight - Erdős constructed graphs with one fewer edge avoiding such subgraphs.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach (Simonovits)**\n\n1. **Threshold Analysis**: The edge count ⌊n²/4⌋ + ⌊(n+1)/2⌋ exceeds Turán's bound by ⌊(n+1)/2⌋.\n\n2. **Structure Forcing**: Extra edges must create dense local structure beyond triangles.\n\n3. **Case Analysis**: Either K₄ appears (4-clique), or cycle structures C_l with apex vertices form.\n\n4. **Both are Saturated Planar**: K₄ has 6 = 3(4) - 6 edges. C_l + 2K₁ has 3l = 3(l+2) - 6 edges.\n\n**Key Insight**: The gap between the construction threshold and the forcing threshold is exactly 1 edge.",
