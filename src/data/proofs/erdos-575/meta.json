    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Simonovits posed this in 1982 as a fundamental question in extremal graph theory. The Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem determines ex(n;H) asymptotically for non-bipartite H. For families containing bipartite graphs, the extremal function is subquadratic, and the question is whether one bipartite member controls the asymptotics.",
    "problemStatement": "For a finite family F of graphs with at least one bipartite member, does there exist bipartite G ∈ F such that ex(n;G) = O(ex(n;F))?",
    "proofStrategy": "We set up the framework for extremal graph numbers, state the Erdős–Simonovits conjecture, and provide context via the Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem and Kővári–Sós–Turán bound.",
