    "problemStatement": "Is there an infinite Sidon set $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ such that\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\gg_\\epsilon N^{1/2-\\epsilon}\\]for all $\\epsilon>0$? The trivial greedy construction achieves $\\gg N^{1/3}$. The first improvement on this was achieved by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [AKS81b], who found an infinite Sidon set with growth rate $\\gg (N\\log N)^{1/3}$. The current best bound of $\\gg N^{\\sqrt{2}-1+o(1)}$ is due to Ruzsa [Ru98]. Erdős [Er73] had offered \\$25 for any construction which achieves $N^{c}$ for some $c>1/3$. Later he [Er77c] offered \\$100 for a construction which achieves $\\omega(N)N^{1/3}$ for some $\\omega(N)\\to \\infty$. Erdős proved that for every infinite Sidon set $A$ we have\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}=0.\\]Erdős and Rényi have constructed, for any $\\epsilon>0$, a set $A$ such that\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\gg_\\epsilon N^{1/2-\\epsilon}\\]for all large $N$ and $1_A\\ast 1_A(n)\\ll_\\epsilon 1$ for all $n$.
