    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #39 asks one of the central questions in additive combinatorics: how dense can an infinite Sidon set be? A Sidon set (also called a B₂ sequence) is a set where all pairwise sums are distinct. For finite Sidon sets in {1,...,N}, the maximum size is approximately √N (see Problem #30). But for infinite Sidon sets, the situation is more subtle.\n\nErdős proved a fundamental upper bound: for any infinite Sidon set A, the limit inferior of A(N)/√N equals zero. This means no infinite Sidon set can have counting function consistently above c√N. The natural question is whether we can achieve A(N) >> N^{1/2-ε} for all ε > 0.\n\nProgress has been slow but steady. The trivial greedy algorithm gives N^{1/3}. Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi (1981) achieved (N log N)^{1/3}, earning $25 from Erdős. Ruzsa (1998) broke the 1/3 barrier with N^{√2-1} ≈ N^{0.414}, earning $100. The gap to N^{1/2-ε} remains open, with a $500 prize.",

    "proofStrategy": "Since this is an open problem, we cannot prove the conjecture. Instead, we formalize:\n\n1. **The conjecture statement** as a precise proposition in Lean\n2. **Erdős's upper bound** as an axiom: liminf A(N)/√N = 0\n3. **Known constructions** as axioms: greedy (N^{1/3}), AKS ((N log N)^{1/3}), Ruzsa (N^{√2-1})\n4. **The gap** as a verified theorem: √2 - 1 < 1/2\n\nThe Erdős-Rényi construction shows that N^{1/2-ε} is achievable if we allow bounded (not zero) collision count, highlighting that the Sidon condition r(n) ≤ 1 is the essential difficulty.",
