  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #881: Minimal Additive Bases**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős in 1998 [Er98] and explores the fine structure of additive bases.\n\n**Background:**\n- An additive basis of order k is a set A ⊂ ℕ such that every sufficiently large natural number can be written as a sum of at most k elements from A\n- The classical example is Lagrange's four-square theorem: every positive integer is a sum of four squares\n- Waring's problem generalizes this: k-th powers form a basis of order g(k)\n\n**The Question:**\nFor a minimal basis (one where no infinite subset can be removed without increasing the order), does there always exist an infinite subset whose removal increases the order by exactly 1?\n\n**Status:** This problem remains OPEN with no known progress toward resolution.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $A \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis of order $k$ which is *minimal*, meaning that if $B \\subset A$ is any infinite subset, then $A \\setminus B$ is not a basis of order $k$.\n\n**Must there exist an infinite $B \\subset A$ such that $A \\setminus B$ is a basis of order $k+1$?**\n\nIntuitively: can we always find an infinite subset to remove that degrades the basis by exactly one order, not more?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\nSince this is an open problem, we formalize:\n\n1. **Core Definitions:** Asymptotic additive basis of order k, minimal bases\n\n2. **Basic Properties:** Order 1 characterization, minimal bases are infinite, monotonicity, subset property\n\n3. **Main Conjecture:** The open problem as erdos881Conjecture\n\n4. **Weaker Version:** erdos881Weak asks if we can increase order by any finite amount\n\n5. **Examples:** Perfect squares (order 4 by Lagrange), k-th powers (Waring)\n\nThe key theorems beyond definitions use `sorry` as this remains unsolved.",
