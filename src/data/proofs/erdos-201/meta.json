  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "First investigated by Riddell (1969), this problem connects two natural measures of arithmetic-progression-free subsets. Erdős asked whether the extremal function R_k(N) for {1,…,N} and the guaranteed function G_k(N) for arbitrary N-element integer sets are asymptotically equal for k=3.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G_k(N) denote the minimum size of a k-AP-free subset guaranteed in any set of N integers, and R_k(N) the maximum size of a k-AP-free subset of {1,…,N}. Is lim_{N→∞} R_3(N)/G_3(N) = 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines k-term arithmetic progressions, AP-free sets, R_k(N) via powerset filtration, and G_k(N) axiomatically. The conjecture is stated as: for every ε > 0, R_3(N) ≤ (1+ε) G_3(N) for large N.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "G_k(N) ≤ R_k(N) trivially since {1,…,N} is an N-element set",
      "Strict inequality: G_3(5) = 3 while R_3(5) = 4",
      "Komlós–Sulyok–Szemerédi (1975) proved R_k(N) ≪_k G_k(N), establishing the same order of magnitude",
      "The conjecture asks whether the constant in the KSS bound approaches 1 for k=3"
