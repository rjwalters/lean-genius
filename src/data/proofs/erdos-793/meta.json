Is there a constant $C$ such that\\[F(n)=\\pi(n)+(C+o(1))n^{2/3}(\\log n)^{-2}?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er38} proved there exist constants $0<c_1\\leq c_2$ such that\\[\\pi(n)+c_1n^{2/3}(\\log n)^{-2}\\leq F(n) \\leq \\pi(n)+c_2n^{2/3}(\\log n)^{-2}.\\]Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er69} gave a simple proof that $F(n) \\leq \\pi(n)+n^{2/3}$: define a graph with vertex set the union of those integers in $[1,n^{2/3}]$ with all primes $p\\in (n^{2/3},n]$. We have an edge $u\\sim v$ if and only if $uv\\in A$. It is easy to see that every $m\\leq n$ can be written as $uv$ where $u\\leq n^{2/3}$ and $v$ is either prime or $\\leq n^{2/3}$, and hence there are $\\geq \\lvert A\\rvert$ many edges. This graph contains no path of length $3$ and hence must be a tree and have fewer edges than vertices, and we are done. This can be improved to give the upper bound mentioned by using a subset of integers in $[1,n^{2/3}]$.\n\nMore generally, one can ask for such an asymptotic for the size of sets such that no $a\\in A$ divides the product of $r$ distinct other elements of $A$, with the exponent $2/3$ replaced by $\\frac{2}{r+1}$.\n\nFor further discussion and references concerning this generalisation to $r\\geq 3$ see the comment by Wouter van Doorn.\n\nSee also [425].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er38] P.
