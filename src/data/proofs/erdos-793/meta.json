  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem dates to Erdős's 1938 paper, making it one of his earliest contributions to extremal combinatorics. A 'primitive' set has no element dividing another; here we strengthen this to: no element divides the product of two others. The primes larger than n^{2/3} automatically satisfy this, so the question is about the 'extra' elements beyond primes.",
    "problemStatement": "Let F(n) be the maximum size of A ⊆ {1,...,n} such that a ∤ bc for all distinct a,b,c ∈ A. Is there a constant C such that F(n) = π(n) + (C + o(1))·n^{2/3}·(log n)^{-2}?",
    "proofStrategy": "Erdős proved bounds π(n) + c₁·n^{2/3}·(log n)^{-2} ≤ F(n) ≤ π(n) + c₂·n^{2/3}·(log n)^{-2} for some constants c₁ < c₂. The upper bound uses a clever graph-theoretic argument: construct a bipartite graph with small integers and large primes as vertices, edges representing products in A. This graph is P₃-free (no path of length 3), hence a forest.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "All primes p > n^{2/3} can be included: they can't divide products of smaller numbers",
      "The 'extra' elements beyond primes contribute the secondary term n^{2/3}·(log n)^{-2}",
      "The graph-theoretic proof: P₃-free graphs are forests with |E| < |V|",
