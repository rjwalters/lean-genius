  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős-Straus conjecture was posed by Paul Erdős and Ernst Straus in 1948. It asks whether every fraction 4/n with n > 2 can be written as a sum of exactly three unit fractions with distinct denominators.\n\nThis is one of the most famous unsolved problems in elementary number theory. Despite its simple statement, it has resisted proof for over 75 years. The conjecture has been verified computationally for all n up to 10^17 (over 100 quadrillion values), yet no general proof exists.\n\nThe problem is related to ancient Egyptian mathematics, where fractions were always written as sums of distinct unit fractions. The conjecture essentially asks: can the Egyptians always express 4/n using exactly three unit fractions?",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős-Straus, 1948)**: For every integer $n > 2$, there exist distinct positive integers $x < y < z$ such that\n$$\\frac{4}{n} = \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z}.$$\n\n**Status:** OPEN\n\n**Verified:** For all $n \\leq 10^{17}$ (Swett, and others)\n\n**Examples:**\n- $4/3 = 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/12$\n- $4/5 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/20$\n- $4/7 = 1/2 + 1/15 + 1/210$",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the conjecture and known partial results:\n\n1. **ErdosStrausConjecture**: The main statement as a universal quantifier\n2. **IsEgyptianFractionRep**: General Egyptian fraction representation\n3. **Concrete examples**: Verified for n=3, 5, 7 using norm_num\n4. **Partial results axiomatized**: Four fractions suffice, density 1, computational bounds\n5. **Schinzel's generalization**: For any a, a/n has a representation for large n\n\nThe conjecture itself remains axiomatized as open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Unit fractions**: A unit fraction has numerator 1 (like 1/2, 1/7). The Egyptians used only these.",
      "**The difficulty**: The 'distinct' requirement is crucial. Without it, 4/n = 1/n + 1/n + 1/n + 1/n is trivial.",
      "**Why 4?**: The case a=3 (3/n as 3 unit fractions) is proved. The case a=4 remains open.",
      "**Computational evidence**: 10^17 verified cases with no counterexample, yet no proof.",
      "**Schinzel's generalization**: For any a, a/n works for sufficiently large n."
