The existence of a representation of $4/n$ as the sum of at most four distinct unit fractions follows trivially from a greedy algorithm.\n\nSchinzel conjectured the generalisation that, for any fixed $a$, if $n$ is sufficiently large in terms of $a$ then there exist distinct integers $1\\leq x<y<z$ such that\\[\\frac{a}{n} = \\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{z}.\\]This problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
