Is it true that\\[A(N)/2^{f(N)}\\to \\infty?\\]Is it true that\\[A(N) = 2^{(1+o(1))f(N)}?\\]\n\n\n\nA problem of Cameron and Erd\\H{o}s. It is known that $f(N)\\sim N^{1/2}$ and conjectured (see [30]) that $f(N)=N^{1/2}+O(N^{\\epsilon})$.\n\nWhile $A(N)$ has not been completely determined, both of these questions are now settled, the first positively and the second negatively. The current best bounds are (for large $N$)\\[2^{1.16f(N)}\\leq A(N) \\leq 2^{6.442f(N)}.\\]The lower bound is due to Saxton and Thomason \\cite{SaTh15}, the upper bound is due to Kohayakawa, Lee, R\\\"{o}dl, and Samotij \\cite{KLRS15}.\n\nSee also [862].\n\nThis is discussed in problem C9 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
