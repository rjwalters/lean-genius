  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, posed by Cameron and Erdős, asks about counting Sidon sets (sets where all pairwise sums are distinct). It connects to additive combinatorics and the hypergraph container method. The problem appears as C9 in Guy's 'Unsolved Problems in Number Theory'.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(N) be the size of the largest Sidon subset of {1,...,N} and A(N) the number of Sidon subsets. Question 1: Is A(N)/2^{f(N)} → ∞? Question 2: Is A(N) = 2^{(1+o(1))f(N)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Sidon sets and the counting functions, then states the Cameron-Erdős questions and their answers as axioms. The current best bounds (Saxton-Thomason lower, KLRS upper) are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A Sidon set has all pairwise sums distinct (B₂ sequence)",
      "f(N) ~ √N (Erdős-Turán)",
      "Question 1: YES - A(N)/2^{f(N)} → ∞ (via lower bound)",
      "Question 2: NO - the exponent is between 1.16 and 6.442, not 1+o(1)"
