Solved by Kwan, Sah, Sauermann, and Sawhney \\cite{KSSS22}. Erd\\H{o}s' original formulation also had the condition that $G$ has $\\gg n^2$ edges, but an old result of Erd\\H{o}s and Szemer\\'{e}di says that this follows from the other condition anyway.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[KSSS22] Kwan, M. and Sah, A. and Sauermann, L. and Sawhney, M., Anticoncentration in Ramsey graphs and a proof of the Erd\\H{o}s-McKay conjecture. arXiv:2208.02874 (2022).\n\n\nBack to the problem",
