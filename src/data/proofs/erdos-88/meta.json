    "historicalContext": "**Ramsey Graphs and Edge Count Flexibility**\n\nA 'Ramsey graph' is one with no large clique or independent set. By Ramsey's theorem, such graphs must have bounded size, but for fixed clique/independence bounds, they can be arbitrarily large. This problem asks about the flexibility of their induced subgraph structure.\n\n**The Erdős-McKay Conjecture**: For graphs with no clique or independent set of size ≥ ε log n, Erdős and McKay conjectured that induced subgraphs can achieve any edge count from 0 to δn² for some δ > 0.\n\n**Partial Progress**: Erdős and McKay proved a weaker version with δ(log n)² instead of δn². The gap from logarithmic to quadratic was open for decades.\n\n**The Solution**: Kwan, Sah, Sauermann, and Sawhney (2022) proved the full conjecture using 'anticoncentration' techniques, earning the $100 Erdős prize.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nFor any ε > 0, there exists δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that if G is a graph on n vertices with:\n- No independent set of size ≥ ε log n\n- No clique of size ≥ ε log n\n\nThen G contains an induced subgraph with exactly m edges for all m ≤ δn².\n\n**Key Insight**: The condition 'no large clique or independent set' actually implies G has Θ(n²) edges (Erdős-Szemerédi), so the δn² bound is natural.\n\n**Answer**: PROVED by Kwan-Sah-Sauermann-Sawhney (2022)",

Defines induced subgraphs and their edge counts\n4. States the Erdős-McKay conjecture formally\n5. Notes the weaker Erdős-McKay bound (log n)²\n6. Axiomatizes Erdős-Szemerédi density result\n7.
