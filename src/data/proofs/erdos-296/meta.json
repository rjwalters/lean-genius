  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem from Erdős-Graham (1980) concerns Egyptian fractions: representations of numbers as sums of distinct unit fractions. The classic example 1 = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 shows one such representation. Erdős asked: if we want multiple disjoint sets of integers from {1,...,N}, each with reciprocals summing to 1, how many can we find? He conjectured the answer might be sublogarithmic in N.",
    "problemStatement": "Let N ≥ 1 and let k(N) be maximal such that there exist k disjoint sets A₁,...,Aₖ ⊆ {1,...,N} with Σ_{n∈Aᵢ} 1/n = 1 for all i. Estimate k(N). Is it true that k(N) = o(log N)?",
    "proofStrategy": "Hunter and Sawhney observed that Theorem 3 from Bloom's 2021 paper on unit fractions, combined with a greedy algorithm, establishes k(N) = (1-o(1))·log N. The key insight is that Bloom's density results about unit fractions imply we can efficiently pack many disjoint unit sets. The sunflower lemma provides a weaker bound of N·exp(-O(√log N)) for sets with equal (not necessarily unit) sums.",
