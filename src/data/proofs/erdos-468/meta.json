  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this in 1980 as part of their study of divisor-related problems. The partial sums of divisors form a natural combinatorial object, but their collective behavior across all integers is poorly understood.",
    "problemStatement": "Let D_n be the set of partial sums of divisors of n (excluding 1). (1) How many elements of D_n are new? (2) If f(N) = min{n : N ∈ D_n}, is f(N) = o(N)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize D_n as partial sums of sorted divisors > 1, define the first-appearance function f(N), and state both conjectures. Small examples illustrate the construction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "D_n is the set of cumulative sums d₁, d₁+d₂, ... of divisors > 1",
      "Each n contributes new partial sums not seen before",
      "The smallest element of D_n is the least prime factor of n",
      "The largest element is σ(n) - 1",
      "f(N) = o(N) would mean most partial sums arise from relatively small n"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #468 asks about the partial sums of divisors: how many are new for each n, and how quickly does f(N) grow? Both questions remain open, connecting divisor theory to combinatorial number theory.",
    "implications": "Understanding partial divisor sums would shed light on the additive structure of divisor sets and the distribution of arithmetic functions.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "How large is D_n \\ ⋃_{m<n} D_m?",
