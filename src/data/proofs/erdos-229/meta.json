Does there exist an entire transcendental function $f(z)$ such that, for all $n\\geq 1$, there exists some $k_n\\geq 0$ such that\\[f^{(k_n)}(z) = 0\\textrm{ for all }z\\in S_n?\\]\n\n\n\nThis is Problem 2.30 in \\cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nSolved in the affirmative by Barth and Schneider \\cite{BaSc72}.\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaSc72] Barth, K.
