  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős studied the distribution of gaps between consecutive primes normalized by the logarithm. The sequence g(n) = (p_{n+1} - p_n)/log(p_n) has average value 1 by the prime number theorem, but its set of limit points S remains mysterious. The conjecture that S = [0, ∞) emerged from Erdős's deep investigations into prime gap irregularities.",
    "problemStatement": "Is the set S of all limit points of (p_{n+1} - p_n)/log(p_n) equal to [0, ∞)? Equivalently, for every C ≥ 0, does there exist an infinite sequence of indices n_i with g(n_i) → C?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize nthPrime and normalizedGap, define IsLimitPointOfGaps via the ε-N formulation, record known partial results (GPY, Westzynthius, Hildebrand–Maier, Merikoski), and state the full conjecture.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "GPY (2009) proved lim inf g(n) = 0, establishing 0 ∈ S and opening the way to bounded gaps",
      "Westzynthius (1931) showed gaps can grow arbitrarily relative to log(p_n), so ∞ ∈ S",
      "Erdős–Ricci proved S has positive Lebesgue measure, showing the conjecture holds for 'many' values",
      "Merikoski (2020) improved the density bound to at least 1/3 of [0, ∞)",
      "The prime number theorem gives average gap ~ log(p_n), so g(n) has average 1, but its fluctuations are poorly understood"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #5 conjectures that every non-negative real number is a limit point of the normalized prime gap sequence. Despite major progress — 0 and ∞ are known to be in S, and at least 1/3 of [0, ∞) is covered — the full conjecture remains open.",
