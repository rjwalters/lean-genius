    "title": "The n-th Prime Axiomatization",
    "content": "We axiomatize nthPrime as a function ℕ → ℕ that is strictly monotone and yields primes for n ≥ 1. This avoids the computability issues of defining p_n constructively while capturing the essential properties needed for the gap analysis.",
    "significance": "The axiomatization is standard for number-theoretic formalizations where explicit prime enumeration is unnecessary."

    "title": "Normalized Gap and Limit Point Definitions",
    "content": "normalizedGap(n) = (p_{n+1} - p_n) / log(p_n) is the key quantity. A value C is a limit point (IsLimitPointOfGaps) if for every ε > 0 and every N, some n ≥ N has |g(n) - C| < ε. This is the standard ε-N formulation of cluster points for real sequences.",
    "significance": "The normalization by log(p_n) is crucial: by PNT, the average gap is ~ log(p_n), so g(n) has average value 1. The question is about the full set of accumulation points."

    "title": "Unbounded Gaps and Large Limit Points",
    "content": "Westzynthius (1931) showed lim sup (p_{n+1} - p_n)/log(p_n) = ∞. Hildebrand and Maier strengthened this to show S contains arbitrarily large finite values. The current best quantitative result on large gaps is due to Ford–Green–Konyagin–Maynard–Tao (2018).",
    "significance": "Together with GPY, this shows S contains both 0 and ∞, but the question of whether S fills all of [0, ∞) remains elusive."

    "significance": "The improving density bounds (positive measure → 12.5% → 1/3) suggest the full conjecture S = [0, ∞) may be true, but the gap from 1/3 to 1 remains substantial."

    "title": "The Full Conjecture: S = [0, ∞)",
    "content": "Erdős conjectured that every non-negative real number is a limit point of g(n). This is formalized as: ∀ C ≥ 0, IsLimitPointOfGaps C. The conjecture implies complete understanding of the fluctuations of prime gaps at the logarithmic scale.",
    "significance": "This is one of the most fundamental open problems about the distribution of primes, connecting to the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture, sieve methods, and the statistical behavior of primes."
