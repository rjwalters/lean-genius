  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product conjecture (1983) is one of the most influential problems in additive combinatorics. It asserts that a finite set cannot simultaneously have small sumset and small product set. Erdős and Szemerédi proved the first super-linear bound |A|^{1+c}. Successive improvements by Solymosi, Konyagin–Shkredov, Rudnev–Stevens, and Bloom have raised the exponent, with Bloom (2025) achieving |A|^{1270/951} ≈ |A|^{1.335}. The conjectured exponent 2-ε remains far out of reach. Related to Problems 53, 808, 818.",
    "problemStatement": "For every ε > 0, does there exist C > 0 such that for every finite set A ⊂ ℤ with |A| ≥ 2, max(|A+A|, |A·A|) ≥ C·|A|^{2-ε}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define sumset, productset, and sumProductMax. The main conjecture ErdosProblem52 asserts the near-quadratic lower bound. We axiomatize the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem and Bloom's current best bound. Trivial bounds and higher-fold generalizations are formalized. The connection to Problem 53 is stated.",
