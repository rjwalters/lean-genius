  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, posed by Erdős and Rado, lies at the heart of infinitary combinatorics. It asks whether ordinal Ramsey properties that fail for finite ordinal exponents can be restored for infinite exponents.\n\nSpecker (1957) discovered a surprising pattern: the Ramsey property ω² → (ω², 3)² holds, but ω^n → (ω^n, 3)² FAILS for all finite n ≥ 3. Larger ordinals can have worse Ramsey properties!\n\nChang (1972) proved the remarkable result that ω^ω restores the property despite all finite exponents ≥ 3 failing. Milner extended this to show ω^ω → (ω^ω, m)² holds for any finite m, and Larson (1973/74) gave a shorter proof.\n\nErdős offered $250 for this problem, which was paid upon Chang's resolution.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $\\alpha = \\omega^\\omega$. Is it true that in any red/blue coloring of the edges of $K_\\alpha$, there is either a red $K_\\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$?\n\n**Answer**: YES (Chang 1972)\n\nIn arrow notation: $\\omega^\\omega \\to (\\omega^\\omega, 3)^2$\n\n**Context**:\n- $\\omega^2 \\to (\\omega^2, 3)^2$ holds (Specker)\n- $\\omega^n \\to (\\omega^n, 3)^2$ FAILS for $n \\geq 3$ (Specker)\n- $\\omega^\\omega \\to (\\omega^\\omega, 3)^2$ holds (Chang — this problem)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the ordinal Ramsey property α → (β, n)² as an axiom, since the full definition requires complex machinery involving order embeddings and colorings of pairs.\n\nWe state Specker's results as axioms: the positive case for ω² and the negative cases for ω^n (n ≥ 3). Chang's main theorem is stated as an axiom, and we derive explicit failure cases for ω³ and ω⁴.\n\nThe Milner-Larson extension to arbitrary finite m is also axiomatized. We prove several ordinal arithmetic identities using Mathlib.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Arrow notation**: α → (β, n)² means every 2-coloring of pairs from α contains a monochromatic β or n-set",
      "**Specker's surprise**: Larger ordinals can have WORSE Ramsey properties. ω³ fails while ω² works!",
      "**Limit ordinal restoration**: The limit ordinal ω^ω restores the property that fails for all successor ordinals ω³, ω⁴, ...",
      "**Milner-Larson generalization**: ω^ω → (ω^ω, m)² holds for ANY finite m, not just m = 3",
