Is it true that in any red/blue colouring of the edges of $K_\\alpha$ there is either a red $K_\\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Rado. For comparison, Specker \\cite{Sp57} proved this property holds when $\\alpha=\\omega^2$ and false when $\\alpha=\\omega^n$ for $3\\leq n<\\omega$ (a question of Erd\\H{o}s for which he offered \\$20).\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Chang \\cite{Ch72}. Milner modified Chang's proof to prove that this remains true if we replace $K_3$ by $K_m$ for all finite $m<\\omega$ (a shorter proof was found by Larson \\cite{La73}).\n\nSee also [591] and [592].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ch72] Chang, C.
