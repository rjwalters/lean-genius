    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in 1985, asking whether all even gap sizes eventually appear among prime gaps. The question connects to the distribution of prime gaps, Cramér's model, and the Maynard–Tao breakthrough on bounded gaps.",

    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize the nth prime and prime gaps, define r(x) as the smallest missing even gap, and state both the weak (r → ∞) and strong (r/log x → ∞) conjectures. Maynard–Tao and Cramér's conjecture provide context.",

      "Only even gaps matter since all prime gaps > 1 are even",
      "r(x) is monotone: as x grows, more gap sizes appear",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #853 remains open in both weak and strong forms. Whether all even gap sizes eventually appear among prime gaps is a fundamental question about prime distribution, tied to the Cramér model and bounded-gap theorems.",
    "implications": "Proving r(x) → ∞ would confirm that primes realize every possible even gap, strengthening our understanding of prime gap completeness. The strong form would refine quantitative estimates.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is there a specific even gap that never occurs (i.e., does r(x) stabilize)?",
