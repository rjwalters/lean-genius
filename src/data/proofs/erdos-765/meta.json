Reiman \\cite{Re58} proved\\[\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\leq \\lim \\frac{\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)}{n^{3/2}}\\leq \\frac{1}{2}.\\]Erd\\H{o}s and R\\'{e}nyi, and independently Brown, gave a construction that proved if $n=q^2+q+1$, where $q$ is a prime power, then\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)\\geq\\frac{1}{2}q(q+1)^2.\\]Coupled with the upper bound of Reiman this implies that $\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)\\sim\\frac{1}{2}n^{3/2}$ for all large $n$. F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{Fu83} proved that if $q>13$ then\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)=\\frac{1}{2}q(q+1)^2.\\]In \\cite{Er93} Erd\\H{o}s makes the stronger conjecture that, for all $n$,\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)=\\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}+\\frac{n}{4}+O(n^{1/2}),\\]although he said he 'never found any convincing evidence for [this] and would really be satisfied with\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)=\\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}+O(n).'\\]Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75} proved\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)\\leq \\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}+\\frac{n}{4}+O(n^{1/2}).\\]Erd\\H{o}s's stronger conjecture was wrong - Ma and Yang \\cite{MaYa23} proved that, for some absolute constant $c>0$ and for a positive density set of $n$, in fact\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)\\leq \\frac{n^{3/2}}{2}+\\left(\\frac{1}{4}-c\\right)n.\\]See also [572].\n\nIn \\cite{Er75} Erd\\H{o}s remarks that he first proved $\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)\\ll n^{3/2}$ while considering the number theoretic problem [425] in 1936, which predates Tur\\'{a}n's study of extremal numbers by 5 years. As Erd\\H{o}s wrote: 'Being struck by a curious blindness and lack of imagination, I did not at that time extend the problem from $C_4$ to other graphs and thus missed founding an interesting and fruitful new branch of graph theory.'\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er38] P.
