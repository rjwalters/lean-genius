  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The problem of determining ex(n; C₄) has a rich history spanning nearly a century. Erdős and Klein first established the order of magnitude n^{3/2} in 1938. Reiman refined the constant in 1958, proving that the limit of ex(n;C₄)/n^{3/2} lies between 1/(2√2) ≈ 0.354 and 1/2. The breakthrough came when Erdős-Rényi and independently Brown showed that projective plane incidence graphs achieve the upper bound. Füredi made this exact for large prime powers in 1983.\n\nRemarkably, Erdős first discovered the n^{3/2} bound in 1936 while studying number-theoretic B₂ sequences (Problem #425), predating Turán's systematic study of extremal numbers by five years. He later wrote of 'a curious blindness' that prevented him from generalizing to other graphs.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem**: Give an asymptotic formula for ex(n; C₄), where ex(n; C₄) denotes the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph containing no 4-cycle (quadrilateral).\n\n**Answer**: ex(n; C₄) ~ (1/2)n^{3/2}\n\nMore precisely:\n- lim_{n→∞} ex(n;C₄)/n^{3/2} = 1/2\n- For n = q² + q + 1 (q prime power > 13): ex(n;C₄) = (1/2)q(q+1)² exactly\n- Erdős's refined conjecture ex(n;C₄) = (1/2)n^{3/2} + (1/4)n + O(√n) was DISPROVED by Ma-Yang (2023)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization establishes the asymptotic formula through several components:\n\n1. **Basic Definitions**: Define 4-cycles, C₄-free graphs, and the extremal function ex(n;C₄)\n\n2. **Upper Bounds**: Axiomatize Erdős-Klein's O(n^{3/2}) and Reiman's lim sup ≤ 1/2\n\n3. **Lower Bounds**: The projective plane construction PG(2,q) achieves (1/2)q(q+1)² edges\n\n4. **Asymptotic Limit**: Combine upper and lower bounds to establish lim = 1/2\n\n5. **Historical Context**: Include Füredi's exact result, Erdős's refined conjecture, and Ma-Yang's disproof",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Projective Planes**: The extremal graphs achieving ex(n;C₄) are incidence graphs of projective planes PG(2,q), connecting graph theory to finite geometry",
      "**Zarankiewicz Problem**: ex(n;C₄) is equivalent to the Zarankiewicz problem z(n,n;2,2) about 0-1 matrices",
      "**B₂ Sequences**: The C₄-free condition relates to Sidon sets in additive combinatorics - this was Erdős's original motivation",
      "**Ma-Yang Disproof (2023)**: Erdős conjectured the coefficient of n in the error term was exactly 1/4, but this was recently disproved",
      "**Pre-Turán History**: This problem predates Turán's famous theorem by 5 years, making it one of the earliest extremal graph theory results"
