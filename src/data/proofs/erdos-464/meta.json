  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #464 asks about the density of fractional parts for lacunary sequences. A sequence A = {n₁ < n₂ < ...} is lacunary with parameter ε > 0 if n_{k+1} ≥ (1+ε)n_k for all k—this means the sequence grows at least exponentially.\n\nFor any real θ, consider the set {‖θn_k‖ : k ≥ 1} where ‖x‖ is the distance to the nearest integer. The question: must there exist irrational θ such that this set is NOT dense in [0, 1/2]?\n\nSolved independently by de Mathan (1980) and Pollington (1979) with bound ε⁴/log(1/ε). Improved by Katznelson (2001), Akhunzhanov-Moshchevitin (2004), Dubickas (2006), and finally Peres-Schlag (2010) who achieved ε/log(1/ε). The conjectured optimal bound is ε.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A = \\{n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be a lacunary sequence (there exists $\\varepsilon > 0$ with $n_{k+1} \\geq (1+\\varepsilon)n_k$ for all $k$).\n\nMust there exist an irrational $\\theta$ such that $\\{\\|\\theta n_k\\| : k \\geq 1\\}$ is NOT dense in $[0, 1/2]$?\n\n**Answer:** YES\n\n**Quantitative bounds:**\n- Original (de Mathan/Pollington): $\\inf_k \\|\\theta n_k\\| \\gg \\varepsilon^4/\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$\n- Best known (Peres-Schlag 2010): $\\inf_k \\|\\theta n_k\\| \\gg \\varepsilon/\\log(1/\\varepsilon)$\n- Conjectured optimal: $\\gg \\varepsilon$",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines lacunary sequences, distance to nearest integer, and the density property. The main theorem of de Mathan-Pollington is axiomatized: for any lacunary A, there exists irrational θ with a gap in the fractional distances. The improved Peres-Schlag bound is also stated. The proof shows that hasGap implies non-density.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #464 was SOLVED by de Mathan (1980) and Pollington (1979). For any lacunary sequence A, there exists irrational θ such that the fractional parts {‖θn_k‖} are not dense. The best known bound is ε/log(1/ε) (Peres-Schlag 2010), with conjectured optimal ε.",
    "implications": "This result shows that lacunary sequences are 'too sparse' for their fractional parts to fill [0, 1/2] densely for all θ. The connection to chromatic numbers of distance graphs (Problem #894) reveals deep interplay between Diophantine approximation and graph theory.",
