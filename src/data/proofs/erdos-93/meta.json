The stronger variant that says there is one point which determines at least $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\\rfloor$ distinct distances (see [982]) is still open. Fishburn in fact conjectures that if $R(x)$ counts the number of distinct distances from $x$ then\\[\\sum_{x\\in A}R(x) \\geq \\binom{n}{2}.\\]Szemer\\'{e}di conjectured a stronger form in which the convexity is replaced by the assumption that there are no three points on a line - see [1082].\n\nSee also [660].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al63] Altman, E., On a problem of P.
