    "historicalContext": "**Convexity Forces Distance Diversity**\n\nAmong Erdős's many distinct distance problems, this one asks specifically about convex configurations. The constraint of convexity - no point inside the convex hull of the others - turns out to force a minimum number of distinct pairwise distances.\n\n**The Result**: Altman (1963) proved that n points in convex position determine at least ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances. This is tight: the regular n-gon achieves exactly ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances.\n\n**Why Convexity Matters**: Without convexity, points can cluster and share distances more freely. Convexity spreads points angularly, creating distance diversity.\n\n**Stronger Conjectures**: The problem spawned several open variants:\n- One point sees ⌊n/2⌋ distances (Problem #982, OPEN)\n- Sum of distance counts ≥ C(n,2) (Fishburn's conjecture)\n- No three collinear suffices (Szemerédi's variant, Problem #1082)",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIf n distinct points in ℝ² form a convex polygon (vertices of a convex hull), then they determine at least ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances.\n\n**Answer**: PROVED by Altman (1963)\n\n**Tightness**: The regular n-gon achieves exactly ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances:\n- Regular triangle: 1 distance\n- Regular square: 2 distances (side and diagonal)\n- Regular pentagon: 2 distances\n- Regular hexagon: 3 distances\n- In general: ⌊n/2⌋ distances",
    "proofStrategy": "**Altman's Approach (1963)**\n\nThe proof uses geometric properties of convex polygons:\n\n1. **Ordered Vertices**: Label vertices v₁, v₂, ..., vₙ in cyclic order around the polygon.\n\n2. **Diagonal Analysis**: Consider distances from v₁ to all other vertices. In a convex polygon, these distances are strictly ordered by the 'span' across the polygon.\n\n3. **Pairing Argument**: Pair distances that are 'symmetric' across the polygon. Show that each pair contributes at least one distinct distance.\n\n4. **Floor Function**: The ⌊n/2⌋ comes from pairing n-1 edges/diagonals from one vertex.\n\n**Key Insight**: Convexity ensures that distances from a single vertex are well-ordered - you can't have d(v₁,vⱼ) = d(v₁,vₖ) for j < k unless j and n-k+1 satisfy specific symmetry conditions.",
