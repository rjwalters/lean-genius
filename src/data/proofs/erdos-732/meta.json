(A pairwise block design means that every pair in $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ is contained in exactly one of the $A_i$.)\n\nAre there necessary and sufficient conditions for $(X_i)$ to be block-compatible?\n\nIs there some constant $c>0$ such that for all large $n$ there are\\[\\geq \\exp(c n^{1/2}\\log n)\\]many block-compatible sequences for $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s noted that a trivial necessary condition is $\\sum_i \\binom{X_i}{2}=\\binom{n}{2}$, but wasn't sure if there would be a reasonable necessary and sufficient condition.\n\nHe could prove that there are\\[\\leq \\exp(O(n^{1/2}\\log n))\\]many block-compatible sequences for $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$.\n\nAlon has proved there are at least\\[2^{(\\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n^{1/2}\\log n}\\]many sequences which are block-compatible for $n$.\nSee also [733].\n\n\nBack to the problem",
