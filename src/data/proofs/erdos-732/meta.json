  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1981. A pairwise balanced block design (PBD) partitions all pairs from {1,...,n} into blocks. The sequence of block sizes determines many properties. Alon proved the counting question, but characterization remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Call a sequence 1 < X₁ ≤ X₂ ≤ ... ≤ Xₘ ≤ n block-compatible if there is a pairwise balanced block design A₁,...,Aₘ ⊆ {1,...,n} with |Aᵢ| = Xᵢ. Q1: Are there necessary and sufficient conditions? Q2: Is there c > 0 such that there are ≥ exp(c·√n·log n) block-compatible sequences?",
    "proofStrategy": "The pair-counting condition Σ C(Xᵢ,2) = C(n,2) is necessary but not sufficient. For counting, Erdős proved the upper bound and Alon proved the matching lower bound, resolving Q2 affirmatively.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Pair-counting is necessary: each pair must be covered exactly once",
      "Pair-counting is NOT sufficient: some sequences satisfying it have no PBD",
      "Erdős upper bound: B(n) ≤ exp(O(√n·log n))",
      "Alon lower bound: B(n) ≥ 2^((1/2+o(1))√n·log n)",
