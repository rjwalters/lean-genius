How many of the partial products $a_1,a_1a_2,\\ldots,a_1\\cdots a_k$ can be squares? Is it true that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, there can be more than $x^{1-\\epsilon}$ squares?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham write it is 'trivial' that there are $o(x)$ many such squares, although this is not quite trivial, using Siegel's theorem.\n\nA positive answer follows from work of Bui, Pratt, and Zaharescu \\cite{BPZ24}, as noted by Tao in this blog post. In particular Tao shows that, if $L(x)$ is the maximal number of such squares possible, and $u(x)=(\\log x\\log\\log x)^{1/2}$, then\\[x\\exp(-(2^{1/2}+o(1))u(x)) \\leq L(x) \\leq x\\exp(-(2^{-1/2}+o(1))u(x)).\\]See also [841].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BPZ24] Bui, Hung M. and Pratt, Kyle and Zaharescu, Alexandru, A problem of Erd\\H{o}s-Graham-Granville-{S}elfridge on\nintegral points on hyperelliptic curves.
