    "content": "IsTree characterizes trees by having n-1 edges. IsComplete requires all distinct pairs to be adjacent. These predicates are used in the hypothesis of the conjecture.",

    "content": "LinearTreeRamsey G means R(G, Tₙ) ≤ Cn for all trees Tₙ. This is a natural condition: the Chvátal–Harary theorem gives R(Tₘ, Tₙ) = m + n - 2, so trees have linear Ramsey numbers against each other.",

    "content": "QuadraticCliqueRamsey G means R(G, Kₙ) ≤ Cn². Since R(Kₘ, Kₙ) grows exponentially, quadratic growth against cliques is a strong structural constraint on G.",

    "title": "EFRS Conjecture",
    "content": "Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1993) conjectured that the two conditions — linear tree Ramsey and quadratic clique Ramsey — together imply Ramsey size linearity. This would provide a clean sufficient condition for size linearity.",
    "significance": "The conjecture bridges classical Ramsey theory and size Ramsey theory, asking whether growth rates of R(G,·) determine the behavior of R̂(G,·)."
