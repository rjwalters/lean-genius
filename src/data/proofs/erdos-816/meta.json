Must $G$ contain two vertices of the same degree which are joined by a path of length $3$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal. The example of $K_{n,n+1}$ shows that this fails if we only have $n^2+n$ edges.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Chen and Ma \\cite{ChMa25}, who prove the stronger statement that, provided $n\\geq 600$, all graphs with $2n+1$ vertices and at least $n^2+n$ edges contain two vertices of the same degree joined by a path of length $3$, except $K_{n,n+1}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ChMa25] K.
