  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in the 1970s, asking whether the fractional parts of pairwise distances in a point set can all be bounded away from 0 for arbitrarily large configurations. Graham gave the first affirmative answer with a logarithmic bound. Sárközy (1976) dramatically improved this to a polynomial bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let N(X, δ) be the maximum number of points in a disk of radius X with ‖|Pᵢ − Pⱼ|‖ ≥ δ for all pairs. Is there δ > 0 such that N(X, δ) → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the fractional distance, the separated configuration structure, the maximum function N(X,δ), Graham's logarithmic lower bound, Sárközy's polynomial improvement, and monotonicity properties.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Graham: N(X, 1/10) ≥ (log X)/10 — first affirmative answer",
      "Sárközy: N(X, δ) > X^{1/2 − δ^{1/7}} for small δ — nearly √X points",
      "The fractional distance is always ≤ 1/2, so δ > 1/2 is trivially impossible",
      "N(X, δ) is monotone in X (non-decreasing) and δ (non-increasing)",
      "Related to Problems #465 (upper bounds) and #953"
