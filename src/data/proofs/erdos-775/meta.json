For graphs, Spencer \\cite{Sp71} constructed a graph which contains cliques of at least $n-\\log_2n+O(1)$ different sizes, which Moon and Moser \\cite{MoMo65} showed to be best possible.\n\nThe answer is no, as proved by Gao \\cite{Ga25}: more generally, for any $k\\geq 3$, every $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains at most $n-f_k(n)$ different sizes of cliques, where $f_k(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$.\n\nSee also [927].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ga25] J.
