Is there any $r$ such that every regular graph of degree $r$ must contain a regular subgraph of degree $3$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Berge (or Berge and Sauer). Alon, Friedland, and Kalai \\cite{AFK84} proved that every $4$-regular graph plus an edge contains a $3$-regular subgraph, and hence in particular every $r$-regular graph with $r\\geq 5$ contains a $3$-regular subgraph.\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by Tashkinov \\cite{Ta82}.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AFK84] Alon, N. and Friedland, S. and Kalai, G., Every {$4$}-regular graph plus an edge contains a\n{$3$}-regular subgraph.
