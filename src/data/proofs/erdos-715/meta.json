  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Berge and Sauer. It asks whether regular graphs of sufficient degree must contain regular subgraphs of smaller degree. The question is fundamental to understanding the structure of regular graphs and their decomposition properties.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every regular graph of degree 4 contain a regular subgraph of degree 3? More generally, is there any r such that every r-regular graph must contain a 3-regular subgraph?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization captures: (1) Basic graph definitions with SimpleGraph', degree, IsRegular. (2) Subgraph definitions. (3) The main question HasRegularSubgraph(r, k). (4) Tashkinov's theorem for r=4. (5) Alon-Friedland-Kalai's auxiliary result. (6) Counterexamples showing r < 4 fails (K_4, Petersen graph). (7) Edge counting arguments for necessary conditions.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #715 (Berge-Sauer Question) asked whether every 4-regular graph contains a 3-regular subgraph. Tashkinov (1982) proved YES. Consequently, every r-regular graph with r ≥ 4 contains a 3-regular subgraph. The threshold is exactly 4: 3-regular graphs like K_4 and the Petersen graph are minimal.",
    "implications": "This result illuminates the structure of regular graphs. It shows that high-degree regularity imposes strong structural constraints. The techniques relate to factor theory and graph decomposition.",
