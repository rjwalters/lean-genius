  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Cantor discovered that triangular numbers aₙ = n(n-1)/2 have both ∑ 1/aₙ and ∑ 1/(aₙ-1) rational. Erdős asked how fast valid sequences can grow, conjecturing that aₙ^(1/n) → ∞ is achievable but aₙ^(1/2ⁿ) → 1 is necessary. In 2024, Kovač and Tao proved doubly exponential growth is possible for some β > 1, partially resolving the first conjecture. The threshold question—whether β = 2 is the limit—remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 ≤ a₁ < a₂ < ... be strictly increasing integers. How fast can aₙ grow if both ∑ 1/aₙ and ∑ 1/(aₙ-1) are rational? Specifically: can we have limsup aₙ^(1/2ⁿ) > 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines valid sequences, introduces growth measures (single and double exponential), states Cantor's example, Erdős's conjectures, and the Kovač-Tao result. The remaining question about the β = 2 threshold is stated as an axiom.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #265 concerns the maximum growth rate of sequences with two rational reciprocal sums. Cantor's triangular numbers give polynomial growth. Kovač and Tao (2024) achieved doubly exponential growth for some β > 1. The question of whether β = 2 is achievable remains the key open problem.",
    "implications": "Resolution would sharpen our understanding of rationality criteria for infinite series and connect to transcendence theory. The irrationality threshold at β = 2 would be a precise dividing line.",
