  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #838, posed by Erdős and Hammer, concerns counting convex subsets of point sets in general position. Given n points in the plane with no three collinear, how many distinct convex polygons can they determine?\n\nThe function f(n) is defined as the MINIMUM number of convex subsets over all n-point configurations. In his 1978 paper 'Some more problems on elementary geometry' (Austral. Math. Soc. Gaz.), Erdős established that f(n) grows like n^{Θ(log n)}, a 'quasi-polynomial' rate faster than any polynomial but slower than any exponential.\n\nThe main question asks whether the normalized quantity (log f(n))/(log n)² converges to a constant c as n → ∞, and if so, what is c?",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that any $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line, determine at least $f(n)$ different convex subsets.\n\nEstimate $f(n)$. In particular, does there exist a constant $c$ such that\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log f(n)}{(\\log n)^2} = c?$$\n\n**Known bounds (Erdős 1978):**\n$$n^{c_1 \\log n} < f(n) < n^{c_2 \\log n}$$\nfor some constants $c_1, c_2 > 0$.\n\n**Status:** OPEN - The limit question remains unresolved.",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines points in general position (no three collinear), convex subsets, and the counting function f(n). Erdős's 1978 bounds are axiomatized: both the lower bound f(n) > n^{c₁ log n} and upper bound f(n) < n^{c₂ log n}. The main theorem combines these to show the quasi-polynomial growth rate. The limit question is stated as an open problem.",
