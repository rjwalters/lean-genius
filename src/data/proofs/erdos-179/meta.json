Find good upper bounds for $F_k(N,\\ell)$. Is it true that\\[F_3(N,4)=o(N^2)?\\]Is it true that for every $\\ell>3$\\[\\lim_{N\\to \\infty}\\frac{\\log F_3(N,\\ell)}{\\log N}=2?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s remarks the upper bound $o(N^2)$ is certainly false for $\\ell >\\epsilon \\log N$. The answer is yes: Fox and Pohoata \\cite{FoPo20} have shown that, for all fixed $1\\leq k<\\ell$,\\[F_k(N,\\ell)=N^{2-o(1)}\\]and in fact\\[F_{k}(N,\\ell) \\leq \\frac{N^2}{(\\log\\log N)^{C_\\ell}}\\]where $C_\\ell>0$ is some constant. In fact, they show that, if $r_\\ell(N)$ is the size of the largest subset of $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ without an $\\ell$-term arithmetic progression then there exists some absolute constant $c>0$ such that\\[\\left(c \\frac{r_\\ell(N)}{N}\\right)^{2(k-1)}N^2 < F_k(N,\\ell) <\\left(\\frac{r_\\ell(N)}{N}\\right)^{O(1)}N^2.\\]Any improved bounds for Szemer\\'{e}di's theorem (see [139]) therefore yield improved bounds for $F_k(N,\\ell)$. In particular, the bounds of Leng, Sah, and Sawhney \\cite{LSS24} imply\\[F_k(N,\\ell) \\leq \\frac{N^2}{\\exp((\\log\\log N)^{c_\\ell})}\\]for some constant $c_\\ell>0$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FoPo20] Fox, J. and Pohoata, C., Sets without $k$-term progressions can have many shorter progressions. arXiv:1908.09905 (2020).\n\n[LSS24] Leng, J., Sah, A. and Sawhney, M., Improved bounds for Szemer\\'{e}di's theorem. arXiv:2402.17995 (2024).\n\n\nBack to the problem",
