  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about arithmetic progression supersaturation, asking: if a set has 'too many' k-term APs, must it contain a longer ℓ-term AP? This connects to the broader theme of density and structure in combinatorics. Fox and Pohoata resolved both questions in 2020, showing F_k(N, ℓ) = N^{2-o(1)}. Leng, Sah, and Sawhney improved the bounds in 2024 using advances in Szemerédi's theorem.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 ≤ k < ℓ be integers. Define F_k(N, ℓ) as the minimum number such that every set A ⊆ ℕ of size N containing at least F_k(N, ℓ) many k-term arithmetic progressions must contain an ℓ-term AP.\n\nErdős asked two questions:\n1. Is F₃(N, 4) = o(N²)?\n2. For every ℓ > 3, is lim_{N→∞} log F₃(N, ℓ) / log N = 2?\n\nThe answer to both is YES.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines arithmetic progressions and the counting function\n2. Defines the supersaturation function F_k(N, ℓ)\n3. States Erdős's two questions formally\n4. Axiomatizes Fox-Pohoata's bound: F_k(N, ℓ) ≤ N² / (log log N)^C\n5. Axiomatizes Leng-Sah-Sawhney's improvement: F_k(N, ℓ) ≤ N² / exp((log log N)^c)\n6. Proves both questions are resolved by these results\n7. Connects to Szemerédi's theorem and Roth's theorem",
