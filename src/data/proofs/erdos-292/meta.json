Explore $A$. In particular, does $A$ have density $1$?\n\n\n\nStraus observed that $A$ is closed under multiplication. Furthermore, it is easy to see that $A$ does not contain any prime power.\n\nThe answer is yes, as proved by Martin \\cite{Ma00}, who in fact proved that if $B=\\mathbb{N}\\backslash A$ then, for all large $x$,\\[\\frac{\\lvert B\\cap [1,x]\\rvert}{x}\\asymp \\frac{\\log\\log x}{\\log x},\\]and also gave an essentially complete description of $B$ as those integers which are small multiples of prime powers.\n\nvan Doorn has observed that if $n\\in A$ (with $n>1$) then $2n\\in A$ also, since if $\\sum \\frac{1}{m_i}=1$ then $\\frac{1}{2}+\\sum\\frac{1}{2m_i}=1$ also.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ma00] Martin, Greg, Denser Egyptian fractions.
