    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #1063, posed by Erdős and Selfridge (1983), asks for the growth rate of n_k, the least n ≥ 2k where all but one of the k values {n, n-1, ..., n-k+1} divide C(n,k). Erdős–Selfridge proved full divisibility never occurs. Monier (1985) showed n_k ≤ k!. Cambie improved this to n_k ≤ k · lcm(2,...,k-1).",
