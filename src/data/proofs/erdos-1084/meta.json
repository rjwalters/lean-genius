  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős introduced this problem in 1946, asking how many unit-distance pairs can occur among separated points. Harborth solved the 2D case exactly in 1974. The 3D case remains open with the conjectured n^{2/3} correction term.",
    "problemStatement": "Estimate f_d(n), the maximum number of unit-distance pairs among n points in ℝ^d with pairwise distances ≥ 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize separated configurations and unit-distance pair counting, state exact results for d=1,2, and develop the conjectured asymptotics for d=3 and general d using kissing number bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The kissing number (max unit neighbors) controls the leading coefficient: 2 for d=1, 6 for d=2, 12 for d=3",
      "Harborth's exact formula f_2(n) = ⌊3n - √(12n-3)⌋ uses triangular lattice geometry",
      "The correction term n^{2/3} in d=3 reflects the surface-to-volume ratio of optimal packings",
      "General dimension: f_d(n) grows linearly in n with coefficient between d and 2^{O(d)}",
      "Bezdek–Reid (2013) proved f_3(n) < 6n - 0.926·n^{2/3}, the best 3D upper bound"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1084 is fully resolved in dimensions 1 and 2 but remains open for d ≥ 3. The conjectured asymptotics f_3(n) = 6n - Θ(n^{2/3}) captures the packing geometry of unit-distance graphs in 3-space.",
    "implications": "Understanding f_d(n) precisely would reveal the fine structure of sphere packings and connect discrete geometry to analytic number theory through lattice point counting.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact constant in the n^{2/3} correction for d=3?",
      "Is there an exact formula for f_3(n) analogous to Harborth's 2D result?",
      "What is the correct order of the kissing number in high dimensions?"
