    "historicalContext": "**The Distinct Lines Problem**\n\nThis classic problem in discrete geometry asks: given n points in the plane, how many distinct lines can they determine? The answer ranges from 1 (all collinear) to C(n,2) (general position).\n\n**Key Historical Results**:\n- **Sylvester-Gallai (1893/1944)**: Non-collinear points determine at least one 'ordinary' line (with exactly 2 points)\n- **Erdős (1985)**: Posed the complete characterization problem\n- **Erdős-Salamon (1988)**: Solved for large n - all values from n to C(n,2) achievable except C(n,2)-1 and C(n,2)-3\n\n**Why These Exceptions?**\n- C(n,2)-1 would require exactly one 'coincidence' - geometrically impossible\n- C(n,2)-3 would require a specific pattern that can't exist\n\n**Related Theorems**: Beck's theorem, Szemerédi-Trotter incidence bound, and the orchard problem are all closely connected.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nGiven n distinct points in ℝ², let f(n) count the number of distinct lines determined by these points. What are the possible values of f(n)?\n\n**Bounds**:\n- Minimum: f(n) = 1 (all points collinear)\n- Maximum: f(n) = C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 (general position, no 3 collinear)\n\n**The Question**: Which integers between 1 and C(n,2) are achievable?\n\n**Answer**: For large n, achievable values are {1} ∪ [n, C(n,2)] \\ {C(n,2)-1, C(n,2)-3}.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach**\n\nThe Erdős-Salamon characterization combines:\n\n1. **Constructions**: Show values ARE achievable\n   - Collinear: 1 line\n   - Circle: C(n,2) lines (general position)\n   - Grids: intermediate values via controlled collinearities\n\n2. **Impossibility Proofs**: Show values are NOT achievable\n   - C(n,2)-1: Would need exactly one 3-point line, impossible\n   - C(n,2)-3: Geometric analysis rules out this configuration\n\n3. **Density Arguments**: Erdős showed almost all intermediate values work using probabilistic and algebraic constructions.\n\n**Key Tools**: Sylvester-Gallai theorem, Beck's dichotomy, incidence bounds.",
