  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdos in 1967 in his paper 'Problems and results on the convergence and divergence properties of Lagrange interpolation polynomials'. It concerns the behavior of polynomial interpolation on [-1,1]. Lagrange showed that given n distinct points, there is a unique polynomial of degree < n passing through them. However, this polynomial can behave badly between the sample points, leading to Runge's phenomenon and related issues.\n\nErdos proved a weaker result: for any bound C, one can find polynomials that stay small at many sample points but become large in [-1,1]. The conjecture asks the converse: can one always CHOOSE the target values to force this behavior for ANY approximating polynomial?",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture:** For any C > 0, there exists epsilon > 0 such that for sufficiently large n: Given any x_1,...,x_n in [-1,1], one can choose y_1,...,y_n in [-1,1] such that if P is a polynomial of degree < (1+epsilon)n passing through at least (1-epsilon)n of the points (x_i, y_i), then max_{x in [-1,1]} |P(x)| > C.\n\n**Status: OPEN**\n\nErdos could not prove this even for the case m = n (exact interpolation).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. **Basic setup:** Polynomial evaluation, max norm on [-1,1], sample/target points\n\n2. **Interpolation conditions:** ApproximatelyInterpolates (>= (1-epsilon)n matches), HasBoundedDegree (< (1+epsilon)n)\n\n3. **The conjecture:** ErdosConjecture1133 - formal statement with all quantifiers\n\n4. **Related result:** Erdos's weaker existence theorem (axiomatized)\n\n5. **Lagrange theory:** Uniqueness, divergence for uniform nodes\n\n6. **Chebyshev connection:** Optimal node placement",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Adversarial choice:** The conjecture requires choosing y_i values that work against ALL polynomials",
      "**Degree flexibility:** The (1+epsilon)n degree bound allows slightly more than n degrees of freedom",
      "**Approximate matching:** Only (1-epsilon)n points need to match, giving some slack",
      "**Lagrange connection:** For exact interpolation (epsilon=0), this is about Lagrange polynomials",
      "**Chebyshev nodes:** These give optimal interpolation behavior, but don't resolve the conjecture",
      "**Erdos's weaker result:** Existence is proven; universal choice of y_i is open"
