There exists $\\epsilon>0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large the following holds.\n\nFor any $x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\in [-1,1]$ there exist $y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\in [-1,1]$ such that, if $P$ is a polynomial of degree $m<(1+\\epsilon)n$ with $P(x_i)=y_i$ for at least $(1-\\epsilon)n$ many $1\\leq i\\leq n$, then\\[\\max_{x\\in [-1,1]}\\lvert P(x)\\rvert >C.\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s proved that, for any $C>0$, there exists $\\epsilon>0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large and $m=\\lfloor (1+\\epsilon)n\\rfloor$ then for any $x_1,\\ldots,x_m\\in [-1,1]$ there is a polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ such that $\\lvert P(x_i)\\rvert\\leq 1$ for $1\\leq i\\leq m$ and\\[\\max_{x\\in [-1,1]}\\lvert P(x)\\rvert>C.\\]The conjectured statement would also imply this, but Erd\\H{o}s in \\cite{Er67} says he could not even prove it for $m=n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er67] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Problems and results on the convergence and divergence properties of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials and some extremal problems.
