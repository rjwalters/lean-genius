  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The triangle inequality appears in Euclid's Elements (Book I, Proposition 20, ~300 BCE) as the statement that any two sides of a triangle together are greater than the remaining side. This geometric insight—that the shortest path between two points is a straight line—is one of the most fundamental principles in mathematics.\n\nThe generalization to metric spaces by Maurice Fréchet (1906) and to normed vector spaces by Stefan Banach (1920s) laid the foundations for functional analysis. Today, the triangle inequality is an axiom in the definition of metrics and norms, making it central to modern analysis, topology, and geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euclid/Wiedijk #91)**: For any real numbers x and y:\n\n$$|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y|$$\n\n**Normed Space Form**: For elements in a normed vector space:\n\n$$\\|x + y\\| \\leq \\|x\\| + \\|y\\|$$\n\n**Metric Space Form**: For points in a metric space:\n\n$$d(x, z) \\leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$$\n\n**Reverse Triangle Inequality**: \n\n$$\\big||x| - |y|\\big| \\leq |x - y|$$",
    "proofStrategy": "**For Real Numbers (Absolute Value Form):**\n\nThe proof considers cases based on the signs of x and y:\n1. If x, y ≥ 0: |x + y| = x + y = |x| + |y| (equality)\n2. If x, y ≤ 0: |x + y| = -(x + y) = -x + (-y) = |x| + |y| (equality)\n3. If opposite signs: |x + y| < |x| + |y| (strict inequality)\n\n**Mathlib Approach:**\nThe formalization leverages `abs_add` for real numbers, `norm_add_le` for normed spaces, and `dist_triangle` for metric spaces. These are the axiomatic foundations in their respective structures.",
