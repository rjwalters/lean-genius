  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #998 was posed by Erdős and Szüsz, asking for a characterization of intervals with minimal discrepancy for irrational rotations. The sequence of fractional parts {αm} for irrational α is equidistributed in [0,1) by Weyl's theorem, meaning the count of points in any interval is approximately proportional to its length.\n\nHecke (1922) and Ostrowski (1927, 1930) proved that if u = {αk} and v = {αℓ} for integers k, ℓ, then the interval [u,v) has O(1) discrepancy—the count differs from the expected value by at most a constant. Erdős and Szüsz asked the converse: are these the only such intervals?\n\nKesten (1966) proved yes, completing the characterization. This connects equidistribution theory to the orbit structure of irrational rotations, with deep connections to continued fractions and the three-distance theorem.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $\\alpha$ be an irrational number. Is it true that if, for all large $n$,\n$$\\#\\{ 1 \\leq m \\leq n : \\{\\alpha m\\} \\in [u,v)\\} = n(v-u) + O(1)$$\nthen $u = \\{\\alpha k\\}$ and $v = \\{\\alpha \\ell\\}$ for some integers $k$ and $\\ell$?\n\n**Answer:** YES. Proved by Kesten (1966).",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines the fractional part function, the counting function for points in an interval, and the notion of O(1) (bounded) discrepancy. Kesten's theorem is axiomatized: bounded discrepancy implies endpoints are from the α-orbit. The Hecke-Ostrowski converse is also stated. Together they give a complete characterization.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Fractional parts:** {αm} = αm - ⌊αm⌋ gives the orbit of irrational rotation",
      "**Equidistribution:** Weyl's theorem says #{m ≤ n : {αm} ∈ [u,v)} ≈ n(v-u), but with O(√n) error for generic intervals",
      "**O(1) discrepancy:** Special intervals have constant-bounded error—these are exactly orbit-endpoint intervals",
      "**Three-distance theorem:** The gaps between consecutive {kα} values have at most 3 distinct lengths, explaining the regularity",
      "**Kesten's contribution:** Completed the characterization by proving the forward direction"
