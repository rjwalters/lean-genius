  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #450 from Erdős–Graham (1980, p.89) asks about the density of integers having a divisor in (n, 2n) within short intervals. Cambie showed that the 'for all x' interpretation fails for certain parameter ranges, using Ford's work on divisor distribution.",
    "problemStatement": "How large must y = y(ε, n) be such that the number of integers in (x, x+y) with a divisor in (n, 2n) is at most ε·y?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define HasDivisorIn (existence of a divisor in (n, 2n)), the counting function countWithDivisor, density bounds, and state both the 'for all x' and 'exists x' versions. Cambie's results and Ford's divisor distribution are axiomatized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The problem has a quantifier subtlety: 'for all x' vs 'exists x'",
      "Cambie: the 'for all x' version fails when ε·(log n)^δ·(log log n)^{3/2} → ∞",
      "For ε ≪ 1/n, y(ε, n) ∼ 2n (intervals of length 2n suffice)",
      "Ford's work on divisor anatomy is foundational",
      "The problem connects divisor distribution to interval density"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #450 asks for the interval length y needed to bound the density of integers with a divisor in (n, 2n). The answer depends on quantifier choice (for all x vs exists x). Cambie showed the universal version fails for certain ε, n ranges. Open.",
