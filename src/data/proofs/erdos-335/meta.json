  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980, p. 51) asked for a characterization of pairs with additive density. The Plünnecke–Ruzsa inequality gives d(A+B) ≥ min(d(A)+d(B), 1), so exact equality is a strong constraint. The known examples come from Weyl equidistribution on the torus.",
    "problemStatement": "Characterize all A, B ⊆ ℕ with positive density such that d(A+B) = d(A) + d(B).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize asymptotic density, sumsets, density additivity, the fractional part construction, and the main conjecture that all examples come from group rotations.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "d(A+B) = d(A) + d(B) implies d(A) + d(B) ≤ 1 — Plünnecke–Ruzsa is tight",
      "Known examples: FractionalPartSet θ X for irrational θ, via Weyl equidistribution",
      "The question generalizes to compact abelian groups beyond ℝ/ℤ",
      "Density additivity is much stronger than the general sumset lower bound",
      "This is a characterization problem, not a yes/no question"
