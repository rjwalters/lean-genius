    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $A\\subset (1,\\infty)$ be a countably infinite set such that for all $x\\neq y\\in A$ and integers $k\\geq 1$ we have\\[ \\lvert kx -y\\rvert \\geq 1.\\]Does this imply that $A$ is sparse? In particular, does this imply that\\[\\sum_{x\\in A}\\frac{1}{x\\log x}<\\infty\\]or\\[\\sum_{\\substack{x <n\\\\ x\\in A}}\\frac{1}{x}=o(\\log n)?\\]\n\n\n\nNote that if $A$ is a set of integers then the condition implies that $A$ is a primitive set (that is, no element of $A$ is divisible by any other), for which the convergence of $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n\\log n}$ was proved by Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er35}, and the upper bound\\[\\sum_{n<x}\\frac{1}{n}\\ll \\frac{\\log x}{\\sqrt{\\log\\log x}}\\]was proved by Behrend \\cite{Be35}. This $O(\\cdot)$ bound was improved to a $o(\\cdot)$ bound by Erd\\H{o}s, S\\'{a}rk\\H{o}zy, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{ESS67}.\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er73} and \\cite{Er77c} Erd\\H{o}s mentions an unpublished proof of Haight that\\[\\lim \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap [1,x]\\rvert}{x}=0\\]holds if the elements of $A$ are independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nOver the years Erd\\H{o}s asked for various different quantitative estimates, for example\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap [1,x]\\rvert}{x}=0\\]or even (motivated by Behrend's bound)\\[\\sum_{\\substack{x <n\\\\ x\\in A}}\\frac{1}{x}\\ll \\frac{\\log x}{\\sqrt{\\log\\log x}}.\\]In \\cite{Er97c} he offers \\$500 for resolving the questions in the main problem statement above.\n\nThis was partially resolved by Koukoulopoulos, Lamzouri, and Lichtman \\cite{KLL25}, who proved that we must have\\[\\sum_{\\substack{x <n\\\\ x\\in A}}\\frac{1}{x}=o(\\log n).\\]See also [858].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Be35] Behrend, F., On sequences of numbers not divisible by another.
