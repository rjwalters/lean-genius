  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the sparseness of sets A ⊂ (1,∞) with the property that |kx - y| ≥ 1 for all distinct x, y ∈ A and all positive integers k. Such sets are called \"well-separated under integer dilation\" - no element can be close to an integer multiple of another.\n\nFor integer sets, this condition implies the set is \"primitive\" (no element divides another). Erdős proved in 1935 that primitive integer sets have convergent reciprocal-log series ∑ 1/(n log n). Behrend showed in 1935 that their partial sums satisfy ∑_{n<x} 1/n ≪ log x / √(log log x).\n\nThe generalization to real sets remained open for decades. In 2025, Koukoulopoulos, Lamzouri, and Lichtman made a breakthrough, proving that ∑_{x<n, x∈A} 1/x = o(log n). The stronger conjectures about liminf of density and convergence of ∑ 1/(x log x) remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A \\subset (1, \\infty)$ be a countably infinite set such that for all $x \\neq y \\in A$ and integers $k \\geq 1$ we have $|kx - y| \\geq 1$. Must $A$ be sparse?\n\n**Partially Solved (2025)**: Koukoulopoulos-Lamzouri-Lichtman proved that $\\sum_{x < n, x \\in A} \\frac{1}{x} = o(\\log n)$.\n\n**Still Open**: (i) $\\liminf |A \\cap [1,x]|/x = 0$? (ii) $\\sum_{x \\in A} \\frac{1}{x \\log x} < \\infty$?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the definitions and axiomatize the main results:\n\n1. **WellSeparatedSet**: Captures the dilation-avoidance condition\n2. **Conjecture variants**: Three different sparseness conditions (i), (ii), (iii)\n3. **KLL Theorem**: The 2025 partial resolution as an axiom\n4. **Primitive sets**: Connection to the integer case\n\nThe KLL theorem is axiomatized because its proof requires GCD graph arguments and multiplicative number theory bounds not yet in Mathlib.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #143 on the sparseness of dilation-avoiding sets. The main theorem (KLL 2025) proves that partial reciprocal sums are o(log n), resolving one of Erdős's three conjectures.
