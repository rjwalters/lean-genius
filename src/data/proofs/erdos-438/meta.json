This can be improved to $\\tfrac{11}{32}N$ by taking all integers $\\equiv 1,5,9,13,14,17,21,25,26,29,30\\pmod{32}$, as observed by Massias.\n\nLagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer \\cite{LOS83} proved this is sharp for the modular version of the problem; that is, if $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ is such that $A+A$ contains no squares then $\\lvert A\\rvert\\leq \\tfrac{11}{32}N$. They also prove the general upper bound of $\\lvert A\\rvert\\leq 0.475N$ for the integer problem.\n\nIn fact $\\frac{11}{32}$ is sharp in general, as shown by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{KLS02}, who proved that the maximal such $A$ satisfies $\\lvert A\\rvert\\leq (\\tfrac{11}{32}+o(1))N$.\n\nSee also [439] and [587].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[KLS02] Khalfalah, A. and Lodha, S. and Szemer\\'{e}di, E., Tight bound for the density of sequence of integers the sum of no two of which is a perfect square.
