    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1111: Anticomplete High-Chromatic Subgraphs**\n\nThis problem was posed by El Zahar and Erdős in 1985.\n\n**Key History:**\n- **Wagon (1980):** Bound implying d(t, 2) ≤ C(t, 2) + 1\n- **El Zahar-Erdős (1985):** Original problem, reduction to t ≤ c, bounds for c = 3\n- **Nguyen-Scott-Seymour (2024):** Strengthened existence with minimum degree constraint\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nHigh chromatic number with bounded clique number forces rich structure. This problem asks what anticomplete high-chromatic substructures must exist.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nTwo vertex sets A, B are **anticomplete** if there are no edges between them.\n\n**Conjecture:** For t, c ≥ 1, there exists d = d(t, c) such that any graph G with χ(G) ≥ d and ω(G) < t contains anticomplete sets A, B with χ(A) ≥ χ(B) ≥ c.\n\n**Known Values:**\n- d(2, 2) = 2, d(3, 2) = 4, d(4, 2) = 5\n- d(t, 2) ≤ C(t, 2) + 1 (Wagon 1980)\n- d(3, 3) ≤ 8 (El Zahar-Erdős 1985)\n\n**Open:** Exact values of d(t, c) for general t, c.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:**\n   - IsAnticomplete: disjoint sets with no edges between them\n   - inducedChromaticNumber: χ of induced subgraph\n   - cliqueNumber: ω(G)\n\n2. **The (t, c, d) Property:**\n   - HasElZaharErdosProperty: the main property\n   - d_func: minimal d for the property to hold\n\n3. **Known Results as Axioms:**\n   - Exact values: d(2,2), d(3,2), d(4,2)\n   - Wagon's bound: d(t, 2) ≤ C(t, 2) + 1\n   - El Zahar-Erdős: d(3, 3) ≤ 8, reduction to t ≤ c\n\n4. **NSS Strengthening:**\n   - HasNSSProperty with minimum degree constraint",
