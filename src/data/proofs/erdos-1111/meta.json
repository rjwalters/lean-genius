Let $d(t,c)$ be the minimal such $d$.\n\nEl Zahar and Erd\\H{o}s note that a result of Wagon \\cite{Wa80b} implies $d(t,2)\\leq \\binom{t}{2}+1$ (and in fact $d(t+1,2)\\leq d(t,2)+t$). We also have $t(2,2)=2$ and $t(3,2)=4$ and $t(4,2)=5$.\n\nEl Zahar and Erd\\H{o}s proved $d(3,3)\\leq 8$ and\\[d(t,3) \\leq 2\\binom{t-1}{3}+7\\binom{t-1}{2}+t\\]for $t>3$.\n\nNguyen, Scott, and Seymour \\cite{NSS24} prove that if $t,c\\geq 1$ then there exists $d\\geq 1$ such that if $\\chi(G)\\geq d$ and $\\omega(G)<t$ then there are anticomplete sets $A,B$ with $\\chi(B)\\geq c$ and such that the minimum degree of the induced graph on $A$ is at least $c$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ElEr85] El-Zahar, M. and Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the existence of two nonneighboring subgraphs in a graph.
