Is it true that if $G$ is a graph with $n$ vertices and $2n-2$ edges such that every proper induced subgraph has minimum degree $\\leq 2$ then $G$ must contain a copy of $C_k$?\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er91} Erd\\H{o}s attributes this to himself and Hajnal, claiming they could prove it for $3\\leq k\\leq 6$, but it appears in an earlier paper of Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, and Schelp \\cite{EFGS88}, where they prove that such a graph on $n\\geq 5$ vertices contains cycles of length $3$, $4$, and $5$, and a cycle of length at least $\\lfloor \\log_2n\\rfloor$, and need not contain a cycle of length longer than $\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nSuch graphs are called degree $3$ critical. This conjecture was disproved by Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szab\\'{o} \\cite{NPS17}, who proved that there are arbitrarily large such graphs with no cycle of length $23$.\n\nIt remains open whether this question has an affirmative answer if we restrict to even $k$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EFGS88] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Faudree, R. and Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, A. and Schelp,\nR.
