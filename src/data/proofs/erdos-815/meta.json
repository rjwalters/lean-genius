  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #815 concerns 'degree 3 critical' graphs - graphs with n vertices and 2n-2 edges where every proper induced subgraph has minimum degree at most 2. Erdős and Hajnal conjectured that such graphs must contain cycles of all lengths k ≥ 3 (for sufficiently large n). They claimed to prove the cases k = 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nEarlier, Erdős, Faudree, Gyárfás, and Schelp (1988) proved that such graphs always contain C_3, C_4, C_5, and a cycle of length at least log₂(n), but need not contain cycles longer than √n.\n\nThe conjecture was disproved by Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szabó in 2017, who constructed arbitrarily large degree 3 critical graphs with no cycle of length 23. The even k case remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 3 and n be sufficiently large. If G is a graph with n vertices and 2n-2 edges such that every proper induced subgraph has minimum degree ≤ 2, must G contain a copy of C_k?\n\n**Answer**: NO (DISPROVED)\n\nNarins-Pokrovskiy-Szabó (2017) constructed counterexamples with no C_23.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n1. The definition of degree 3 critical graphs\n2. The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture\n3. EFGS positive results (C_3, C_4, C_5 always exist)\n4. EFGS bounds (log n ≤ longest cycle ≤ √n)\n5. The Narins-Pokrovskiy-Szabó counterexample as an axiom\n6. A formal proof that this counterexample disproves the conjecture\n\nThe disproof is by contradiction: the conjecture would imply large graphs contain C_23, but the counterexample provides arbitrarily large graphs without C_23.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #815 is DISPROVED. The Erdős-Hajnal conjecture that degree 3 critical graphs must contain all cycle lengths k ≥ 3 is false. Narins, Pokrovskiy, and Szabó constructed arbitrarily large such graphs with no C_23. However, such graphs do always contain C_3, C_4, and C_5.",
    "implications": "The result shows that while degree 3 critical graphs have rich local cycle structure (short cycles always exist), global constraints (avoiding a specific longer cycle) can be achieved through careful construction. This separates the 'short cycle' and 'arbitrary cycle' behaviors.",

      "What is the smallest k for which counterexamples exist?",
      "Can the techniques extend to other odd k values?",
