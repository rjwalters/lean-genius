  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "An 'irrationality sequence' is one where Σ 1/(t_n · a_n) is irrational for ALL choices of positive integers t_n. Erdős asked how slowly such sequences can grow. He proved in 1975 that 2^{2^n} works. Hančl (1991) essentially solved the problem by showing that limsup (log log a_n)/n ≥ 1 is necessary.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nSuppose a₁ < a₂ < ... is a sequence such that Σ 1/(t_n · a_n) is irrational for all positive integer sequences t_n.\n\n**Question:** How slowly can a_n grow?\n\n**Answer:** (Hančl 1991)\nlimsup (log₂ log₂ a_n)/n ≥ 1 is NECESSARY.\n\n**Examples:**\n- 2^{2^n} works (Erdős 1975)\n- n! does NOT work",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines irrationality sequences and the weighted sum. Erdős's example 2^{2^n} is axiomatized as working. Hančl's theorem gives the necessary growth condition. The key insight is that slower growth allows clever choices of t_n to make the sum rational.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #262 is SOLVED. Irrationality sequences must grow at least as fast as 2^{2^{cn}} for some c > 0. Hančl's condition limsup (log log a_n)/n ≥ 1 gives the sharp characterization. The sequence 2^{2^n} is an example; n! is not.",
