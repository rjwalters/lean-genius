How slowly can $a_n$ grow?\n\n\n\nOne possible definition of an 'irrationality sequence' (see also [263] and [264]). An example of such a sequence is $a_n=2^{2^n}$ (proved by Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75c}), while a non-example is $a_n=n!$. It is known that if $a_n$ is such a sequence then $a_n^{1/n}\\to\\infty$.\n\nThis was essentially solved by Han\\v{c}l \\cite{Ha91}, who proved that such a sequence needs to satisfy\\[\\limsup_{n\\to \\infty} \\frac{\\log_2\\log_2 a_n}{n} \\geq 1.\\]More generally, if $a_n\\ll 2^{2^{n-F(n)}}$ with $F(n)<n$ and $\\sum 2^{-F(n)}<\\infty$ then $a_n$ cannot be an irrationality sequence.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er75c] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some problems and results on the irrationality of the sum of infinite series.
