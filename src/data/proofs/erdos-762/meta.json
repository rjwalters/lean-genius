    "historicalContext": "The cochromatic number ζ(G) is the minimum colors needed where each color class induces either a complete graph or independent set. Erdős, Gimbel, and Straight (1990) conjectured that χ(G) ≤ ζ(G) + 2 for K₅-free graphs with ζ(G) ≥ 4. This was disproved by Steiner in 2024.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős-Gimbel-Straight 1990):**\nIf G has no K₅ (ω(G) ≤ 4) and ζ(G) ≥ 4, then χ(G) ≤ ζ(G) + 2.\n\n**Answer:** NO (Steiner 2024)\n\n**Counterexample:** A graph G with ω(G) = 4, ζ(G) = 4, and χ(G) = 7.\nThis gives χ = 7 > 6 = ζ + 2, disproving the conjecture.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cochromatic coloring (each color class is a clique or independent set), states the EGS conjecture, axiomatizes Steiner's counterexample, and derives the falsity of the conjecture. The general bounded gap theorem (EGS 1990) is also formalized.",

    "implications": "**What This Means:**\n\n1. The specific bound \"+2\" in the EGS conjecture was too optimistic\n2. The general bounded gap theorem (χ - ζ is bounded by f(ω)) remains true\n3. The optimal function f(n) for the gap remains an open question\n4. Cochromatic colorings are strictly more powerful than proper colorings",
