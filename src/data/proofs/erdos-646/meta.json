Are there infinitely many n\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"position: relative;\">nnn such that n!\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"position: relative;\">n!n!n! is divisible by an even power of each of the pi\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"position: relative;\">pipip_i? The answer is yes, proved by Berend [Be97], who further proved that the sequence of such n\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"position: relative;\">nnn has bounded gaps (where the bound depends on the initial set of primes).
