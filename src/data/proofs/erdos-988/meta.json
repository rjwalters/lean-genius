    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #988: Discrepancy on the Sphere**\n\nThis is a fundamental problem in discrepancy theory, asking whether finite point sets on the sphere can approximate uniform distribution arbitrarily well.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős (1964): Posed the problem\n- Roth (1954): Proved the analogous result for the unit square with axis-aligned rectangles\n- Schmidt (1969): Proved for the sphere in any dimension\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nGiven n points on S², we measure 'discrepancy' by how much the point count in any spherical cap deviates from the expected fraction. Schmidt proved this deviation must grow as n → ∞.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nIf P ⊆ S² is a subset of the unit sphere, define the discrepancy:\n\n$$D(P) = \\max_C |#(C \\cap P) - \\alpha_C \\cdot |P||$$\n\nwhere the maximum is over all spherical caps C, and αC is the normalized measure of C.\n\n**Question:** Does min_{|P|=n} D(P) → ∞ as n → ∞?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nSchmidt (1969) proved this for spheres in any dimension d ≥ 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Sphere and Caps:**\n   - UnitSphere d: {x ∈ ℝ^{d+1} : ||x|| = 1}\n   - SphericalCap: parametrized by center and height h ∈ [-1,1]\n   - Cap points: {x ∈ S^d : ⟨v, x⟩ ≥ h}\n\n2. **Discrepancy:**\n   - capDiscrepancy: |#(C ∩ P) - αC · |P|| for one cap\n   - discrepancy: sup over all caps\n   - minDiscrepancy: inf over all n-point configurations\n\n3. **Key Theorems:**\n   - roth_1954: Rectangle discrepancy ≥ c·(log n)^{1/4}\n   - schmidt_1969: Spherical discrepancy ≥ c·n^{d/(2d+2)}\n   - erdos_988_solved: Tendsto minDiscrepancy atTop atTop",
