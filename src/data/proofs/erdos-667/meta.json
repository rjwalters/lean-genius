  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp studied H(n;p,q), the largest clique guaranteed in n-vertex graphs where every p-set has ≥ q edges. They defined c(p,q) = lim inf log H/log n and asked whether it is strictly increasing in q. Known bounds include the Ramsey-type bounds for q = 1 and c(p, ⌊(p-1)/2⌋) ≤ 1/2.",
    "problemStatement": "Is c(p,q) strictly increasing in q for 1 ≤ q ≤ C(p-1,2) + 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatises H(n;p,q) with monotonicity and boundary values, then defines c(p,q) with known Ramsey bounds and the EFRS bound. The strict monotonicity conjecture is the main statement.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "H(n;p,q) generalises Ramsey numbers by requiring q edges per p-set",
      "c(p,1) corresponds to classical Ramsey: 1/(p-1) ≤ c ≤ 2/(p+1)",
      "c(p, C(p-1,2)+1) = 1 trivially (every graph is complete)",
