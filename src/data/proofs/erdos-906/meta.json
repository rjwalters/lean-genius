From context he seems to attribute this to Barth and Schneider \\cite{BaSc72}, but this paper contains no such result.\n\nTang points out that the problem is trivial if we take $f$ to be a polynomial, so presumably it is intended the function $f$ is transcendental.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaSc72] Barth, K.
