What is the order of growth of $F(N)$?\n\n\n\nOriginally due to Straus. It is known that\\[N^{1/4}\\ll F(N) \\ll N^{1/4+o(1)}.\\]The lower bound is due to Bosznay \\cite{Bo89} and the upper bound to Pham and Zakharov \\cite{PhZa24}, improving an earlier bound of Conlon, Fox, and Pham \\cite{CFP23}. The original upper bound of Erd\\H{o}s and S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy \\cite{ErSa90} was $\\ll (N\\log N)^{1/2}$.\n\nSee also [789].\n\nThis is discussed in problem C16 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bo89] Bosznay, \\'{a}.
