  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The BSD conjecture arose from extensive computational experiments in the 1960s. It connects arithmetic (rational points) with analysis (L-functions) in a precise quantitative way.",
    "problemStatement": "**Weak BSD:** rank(E(Q)) = ord_{s=1} L(E,s)\n\n**Strong BSD:** The leading Taylor coefficient of L(E,s) at s=1 equals a precise formula involving periods, regulators, and the Shafarevich-Tate group.",
    "proofStrategy": "This file provides:\n1. Abstract definitions of elliptic curves and L-functions\n2. The formal BSD statement\n3. Known proven cases (rank 0, rank 1)",

      "The conjecture is OPEN - one of the Millennium Prize Problems",
