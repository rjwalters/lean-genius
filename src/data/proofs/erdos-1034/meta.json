    "historicalContext": "**Erdős-Faudree Conjecture**\n\nErdős and Faudree conjectured that dense graphs (above Turán threshold) must have a triangle with many 'good neighbors' - vertices adjacent to at least two triangle vertices. They guessed > (1/2 - o(1))n such vertices.\n\n**Erdős's Skepticism**: Erdős himself noted 'perhaps this conjecture is a bit too optimistic'.\n\n**Resolution**: Ma and Tang disproved the conjecture by constructing counterexamples where every triangle has at most (2 - √(5/2) + o(1))n ≈ 0.419n good neighbors.",

    "proofStrategy": "**Counterexample Construction (Ma-Tang)**\n\n1. **Key Insight**: Construct graphs just above Turán threshold where triangles have limited common neighbor structure.\n\n2. **Upper Bound**: 2 - √(5/2) ≈ 0.4189 from careful construction.\n\n3. **Lower Bound**: (1/6)n from book lemma - every dense graph has a triangle with n/6 common neighbors.\n\n4. **K₄-free Variant**: Without K₄, bound is 2√3 - 3 ≈ 0.464n.",

    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance**\n\n1. **Counterexample Construction**: Shows optimal conjectures need careful analysis\n\n2. **Book Lemma**: Provides lower bound via common neighbors\n\n3. **K₄-free Graphs**: Different threshold (2√3 - 3)n\n\n4. **Extremal Graph Theory**: Refines understanding of triangle structure",
