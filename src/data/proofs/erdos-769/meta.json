  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #769: Cube Dissection**\n\nThis problem concerns decomposing an n-dimensional unit cube into k smaller homothetic (scaled but not rotated) cubes. The function c(n) is the threshold beyond which any k cubes suffice.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Hadwiger**: First investigated this problem, proving c(n) ≥ 2^n + 2^{n-1}.\n- **c(2) = 6**: Known exactly - a square cannot be decomposed into 2, 3, 4, or 5 smaller squares.\n- **Meier**: Conjectured c(3) = 48 (still unproven).\n- **Burgess-Erdős (1974)**: Proved c(n) ≪ n^{n+1}.\n- **Hudelson (1998)**: Improved bounds under divisibility conditions.\n- **Connor-Marmorino (2018)**: Best known lower bound c(n) ≥ 2^{n+1} - 1 and refined upper bounds.\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe problem sits at the intersection of combinatorial geometry, packing problems, and number theory. The key constraint is that beyond volume (Σ side^n = 1), the cubes must actually pack geometrically.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $c(n)$ be the minimal integer such that if $k \\geq c(n)$, then the $n$-dimensional unit cube can be decomposed into $k$ homothetic $n$-dimensional cubes.\n\n**Question:** Give good bounds for $c(n)$. In particular, is it true that $c(n) \\gg n^n$?\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- **Lower:** $c(n) \\geq 2^{n+1} - 1$ for $n \\geq 3$ (Connor-Marmorino 2018)\n- **Upper:** $c(n) \\leq e^2 n^n$ or $c(n) \\leq 1.8 n^{n+1}$ (Connor-Marmorino 2018)\n\n**Erdős's Conjecture:** If $n+1$ is prime, then $c(n) > n^n$.\n\n**Status:** OPEN - the gap between exponential lower bound and super-exponential upper bound remains unresolved.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** Define CanDecomposeCubeIntoKCubes predicate and cubeDissectionNumber function.\n\n2. **2D Case:** State that c(2) = 6 (impossible for k = 2,3,4,5).\n\n3. **Lower Bounds:** Axiomatize Hadwiger's bound and Connor-Marmorino's improvement.\n\n4. **Upper Bounds:** Axiomatize Burgess-Erdős, Hudelson, and Connor-Marmorino bounds.\n\n5. **Conjecture:** Define Erdős's conjecture that c(n) > n^n when n+1 is prime.\n\n6. **Gap Analysis:** Theorem showing the current state: exponential lower vs super-exponential upper.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**c(2) = 6:** The 2D case is completely solved - a square cannot be split into 2,3,4, or 5 squares",
      "**Exponential Lower Bound:** Connor-Marmorino proved c(n) ≥ 2^{n+1} - 1, exponential in n",
      "**Super-Exponential Upper Bound:** c(n) is at most O(n^n) or O(n^{n+1}) depending on whether n+1 is prime",
      "**Huge Gap:** The gap between 2^n and n^n grows rapidly - the main question asks which is closer to the truth",
      "**Packing vs Volume:** The constraint is not just volume (Σ aᵢⁿ = 1) but geometric packing",
      "**Connection to Number Theory:** The upper bounds depend on primality of n+1"
