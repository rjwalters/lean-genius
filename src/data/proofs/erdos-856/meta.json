This in particular implies that, for every $t$, there are $<k$ solutions to $t=ap$ with $a\\in A$ and $p$ prime, whence\\[\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{p<N}\\frac{1}{p}< k \\sum_{t<N^2}\\frac{1}{t} \\ll \\log N,\\]and the bound follows since $\\sum_{p<N}\\frac{1}{p}\\gg \\log\\log N$.\n\nImproved bounds have been given by Tang and Zhang \\cite{TaZh25}, who proved bounds of the shape\\[(\\log N)^{b_k-o(1)}\\leq f_k(N)\\leq (\\log N)^{c_k+o(1)}\\]for some constants $0<b_k\\leq c_k\\leq 1$, and in particular\\[(\\log N)^{0.438}\\leq f_3(N)\\leq (\\log N)^{0.889},\\]say, for all large $N$. The exponents here are related to progress in the sunflower conjecture [857], to which this problem is closely related. For example, the exponents $c_k$ are $<1$ (and so the upper bound above is non-trivial) if and only if [857] holds for $k$-sunflowers.\n\nThe analogous question with natural density in place of logarithmic density (that is, we measure $\\lvert A\\rvert$ in place of $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}$) is the subject of [536]. In particular Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er70} has constructed $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ with $\\lvert A\\rvert \\gg N$ where no four have the same pairwise least common multiple, and hence the interest of the natural density problem is the $k=3$ case.\n\nA related combinatorial problem is asked at [857].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er70] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some extremal problems in combinatorial number theory.
