    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1970 [Er70], asking about the maximum harmonic sum of subsets avoiding k elements with uniform pairwise LCM. This connects to the sunflower conjecture and has seen recent progress by Tang and Zhang (2025).",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 3 and f_k(N) be the maximum value of Σ_{n∈A} 1/n, where A ranges over all subsets of {1,...,N} which contain no subset of size k with the same pairwise least common multiple. Estimate f_k(N).",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem remains OPEN. Key partial results include Erdős's upper bound log(N)/log(log(N)) and Tang-Zhang's improved bounds showing (log N)^{b_k} ≤ f_k(N) ≤ (log N)^{c_k}. The connection to sunflower conjecture provides structural insight.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #856 remains OPEN. The goal is to estimate f_k(N), the maximum harmonic sum of k-LCM-free subsets of {1,...,N}. Erdős gave an initial bound, Tang-Zhang (2025) improved it to polynomial powers of log N, and the problem is deeply connected to the sunflower conjecture.",
