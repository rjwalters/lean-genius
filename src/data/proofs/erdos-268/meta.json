  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects harmonic series analysis with topology. Given an infinite subset A ⊆ ℕ with convergent harmonic subseries Σ_{n∈A} 1/n < ∞, we can construct a d-dimensional point by taking shifted sums: (Σ 1/n, Σ 1/(n+1), ..., Σ 1/(n+d-1)). The question asks whether the set X of all such points has nonempty interior—does it contain an open ball?\n\nErdős and Straus first proved the 2-dimensional case. The 3-dimensional version remained open for decades until Kovač (2024) gave an explicit construction of an open ball inside X. Shortly after, Kovač and Tao (2024) proved the result for all dimensions d ≥ 1, using techniques from the theory of Ahmes series (Egyptian fractions).\n\nThis result is surprising because the constraints on A are quite restrictive: A must be infinite, yet its harmonic sum must converge (a very 'thin' condition). Despite this, the resulting points fill out an open region in ℝ^d.",
    "problemStatement": "Let X ⊆ ℝ^d be the set of all points (Σ_{n∈A} 1/n, Σ_{n∈A} 1/(n+1), ..., Σ_{n∈A} 1/(n+d-1)) as A ranges over infinite subsets of ℕ with Σ_{n∈A} 1/n < ∞. Does X have nonempty interior?\n\n**Answer**: YES for all d ≥ 1 (Kovač 2024, Kovač-Tao 2024)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining harmonic subseries convergence, the shifted harmonic sums, and the d-dimensional point set X. The main theorem (that X has nonempty interior) is axiomatized since the proof involves sophisticated analysis beyond Mathlib. We prove derived results including the existence of an open ball, and formalize special cases: d=2 (Erdős-Straus), d=3 (Kovač). We also establish coordinate properties and give concrete examples using squares and powers of 2.",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #268 on the interior of harmonic subseries points. The main result—that X has nonempty interior in ℝ^d for all d ≥ 1—is axiomatized since the proof requires sophisticated analysis. We formalize the historical cases (Erdős-Straus d=2, Kovač d=3) and the general result (Kovač-Tao 2024), along with structural properties of the point set.",
    "implications": "This result connects number theory (harmonic series, convergent subseries) with topology (interior, open sets) in a surprising way. Despite the restrictive constraint that A be infinite with convergent sum, the resulting points fill out an open region. This has connections to Ahmes series (Egyptian fractions) and analytic number theory.",
