    "historicalContext": "**Property B and 2-Colorability**\n\nA family F has Property B if there exists a 2-coloring of the ground set such that no set in F is monochromatic. Equivalently, there exists a set B that intersects every member of F but contains none of them.\n\n**The Question**: Erdős asked whether bounded families (at most c·2^n sets of size n) have not just one such set B, but exponentially many.\n\n**Resolution**: Koishi Chan proved this is true: there exist ≫_c 2^|X| good sets B.\n\n**Connection to Problem 901**: The existence of a single good set is equivalent to Property B, which is the subject of Problem 901.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet c > 0 and n be sufficiently large. Suppose F is a family of at most c·2^n sets, each of size n. Let X = ∪_{A∈F} A.\n\nMust there exist ≫_c 2^|X| sets B ⊆ X which intersect every set in F, yet contain none of them?\n\n**Status**: SOLVED\n\n**Answer**: YES (proved by Koishi Chan)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach**\n\n1. **Property B First**: Show bounded families have Property B (at least one good set exists).\n\n2. **Abundance**: From one good set, show many exist via probabilistic or counting arguments.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Intuition**: A random subset B intersects A with probability 1 - 2^(-n) and doesn't contain A with probability 1 - 2^(-n). For bounded |F|, expected good sets is large.\n\n4. **Density Bound**: The fraction of subsets that are good is bounded below by a constant depending only on c.",
