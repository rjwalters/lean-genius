Suppose that $\\mathcal{F}$ is a family of at most $c2^n$ many finite sets of size $n$. Let $X=\\cup_{A\\in \\mathcal{F}}A$.\n\nMust there exist $\\gg_c 2^{\\lvert X\\rvert}$ many sets $B\\subset X$ which intersect every set in $\\mathcal{F}$, yet contain none of them?\n\n\n\nThe existence of a single such $B$ is equivalent to $\\mathcal{F}$ being $2$-chromatic (or having property B), see [901].\n\nThis is true, and a proof was given in the comment section by Koishi Chan.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
