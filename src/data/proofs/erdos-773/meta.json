    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #773 (Sidon Subsets of Squares)**\n\nA Sidon set (B₂ sequence) has all pairwise sums distinct. The question asks: how large can a Sidon set be when restricted to perfect squares?\n\n**Key Results:**\n- **Alon-Erdős (1985):** Lower bound N^{2/3-o(1)} via random construction; upper bound N/(log N)^{1/4}\n- **Lefmann-Thiele (1995):** Improved lower bound to N^{2/3}\n- **Landau (1908):** Sums of two squares have density ~(log N)^{-1/2}, constraining Sidon sets of squares\n\n**Status:** OPEN - gap between N^{2/3} and N/(log N)^{1/4} remains",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nWhat is the size of the largest Sidon subset A ⊆ {1², 2², ..., N²}? Is it N^{1-o(1)}?\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: |A| ≥ c·N^{2/3} (Lefmann-Thiele 1995)\n- Upper: |A| ≤ C·N/(log N)^{1/4} (Alon-Erdős 1985)\n\n**Key Question:** Is the true answer closer to N^{1-o(1)} or N^{2/3}?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach**\n\n1. **Sidon Sets:** Define the Sidon property (distinct pairwise sums)\n\n2. **Bounds:** State lower (random construction) and upper (Landau counting) bounds\n\n3. **Landau Connection:** Sums of two squares are sparse - this constrains Sidon sets",
