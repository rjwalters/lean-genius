For an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ let $\\tau(G)$ denote the covering number (or transversal number), the minimum size of a set of vertices which includes at least one from each edge in $G$.\n\nDetermine the best possible $t$ such that, if $G$ is an $r$-uniform hypergraph $G$ where every subgraph $G'$ on at most $3r-3$ vertices has $\\tau(G')\\leq 1$, we have $\\tau(G)\\leq t$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Tuza \\cite{EHT91} proved that this $t$ satisfies\\[\\frac{3}{16}r+\\frac{7}{8}\\leq t \\leq \\frac{1}{5}r.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHT91] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Hajnal, Andr\\'{a}s and Tuza, Zsolt, Local constraints ensuring small representing sets.
