    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Lacampagne, and Selfridge (1988, 1993) studied the deficiency of binomial coefficients, measuring how many falling factorial terms are smooth. The problem was also presented at the 1986 West Coast Number Theory conference.",

    "proofStrategy": "We define IsKSmooth, NoSmallPrimeFactors, and deficiency as a Finset cardinality. ErdosProblem1093i (infinitely many deficiency-1) and ErdosProblem1093ii (finitely many deficiency > 1) are stated. Known examples (C(7,3), C(13,4), C(284,28)) and the ELS upper bound n ≪ 2^k·√k are axiomatized. Proved: large_factor_no_contribution.",
