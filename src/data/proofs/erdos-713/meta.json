    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nIs it true that, for every bipartite graph $G$, there exists some $\\alpha\\in [1,2)$ and $c>0$ such that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\\sim cn^\\alpha?\\]Must $\\alpha$ be rational?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Simonovits. Erd\\H{o}s sometimes asked this in the weaker version with just\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\\asymp n^{\\alpha}.\\]Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er67d} had initially conjectured that, for any bipartite graph $G$, $\\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\\sim cn^{\\alpha}$ for some constant $c>0$ and $\\alpha$ of the shape $1+\\frac{1}{k}$ or $2-\\frac{1}{k}$ for some integer $k\\geq 2$. This was disproved by Erd\\H{o}s and Simonovits \\cite{ErSi70}.\n\nThe analogous statement is not true for hypergraphs, as shown by Frankl and F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{FrFu87}, who proved that if $G$ is the $5$-uniform hypergraph on $8$ vertices with edges $\\{12346,12457,12358\\}$ then $\\mathrm{ex}(n;G)=o(n^5)$ but $\\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\\neq O(n^c)$ for any $c<5$.\n\nA simplified proof was given by F\\\"{u}redi and Gerbner \\cite{FuGe21}, who extended it to a counterexample for all $k\\geq 5$. It remains open whether it is true for $k=3$ and $k=4$ (though F\\\"{u}redi and Gerbner conjecture it is not).\n\nSee also [571].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er67d] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some recent results on extremal problems in graph theory.\n{R}esults.
