  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós (1994) studied the structure of sumsets A + A when A is a Sidon set. They asked whether large Sidon sets always produce many isolated elements in A + A — elements with no neighbors in the sumset. The stronger form conjectures ≫ |A|² such elements.",
    "problemStatement": "For any M ≥ 1, if A ⊂ ℕ is a sufficiently large finite Sidon set, do there exist at least M elements a ∈ A + A such that a - 1, a + 1 ∉ A + A?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsSidonFinset (distinct pairwise sums), sumsetFinset (A + A), IsIsolated and isolatedCount. ErdosProblem152 states the weak version (unbounded count). ErdosProblem152Strong states the ≫ |A|² version. Sumset size and range bounds for Sidon sets are axiomatized. The infinite version is also stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Sidon sets have |A + A| = n(n+1)/2, nearly half of all possible sums",
      "The sumset fits in an interval of length ≤ 2·max A, creating many gaps",
      "Isolated elements are those with no sumset neighbors, measuring sparsity",
      "The conjectured ≫ |A|² count says a positive fraction of the sumset is isolated"
