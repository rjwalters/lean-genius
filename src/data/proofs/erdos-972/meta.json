  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the intersection of prime number theory and the floor function applied to irrational scaling. Given an irrational α > 1, we scale each prime p by α, take the floor, and ask whether infinitely many such values are also prime.\n\nVinogradov (1948) proved that the sequence {pα} is uniformly distributed for every irrational α, which answers a related but distinct question: there are infinitely many primes of the form p = ⌊nα⌋ (primes obtained as floors of scaled integers). However, Problem #972 asks the 'converse': starting with primes p, are the floors ⌊pα⌋ also often prime?\n\nThe distinction is subtle but fundamental. Vinogradov's result concerns which integers n produce primes when scaled, while Erdős's question concerns what happens when we scale primes specifically.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős)**: Let $\\alpha > 1$ be irrational. Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\\lfloor p\\alpha \\rfloor$ is also prime?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Related Result (Vinogradov 1948)**: The sequence $\\{p\\alpha\\}$ is uniformly distributed for irrational $\\alpha$. This implies infinitely many primes $p = \\lfloor n\\alpha \\rfloor$ exist, but this is a different question.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the open conjecture and related concepts:\n\n1. **Prime Set Definition**: Define primeSet(α) = {p prime : ⌊αp⌋ is prime}\n\n2. **Conjecture Statement**: For irrational α > 1, is primeSet(α) infinite?\n\n3. **Related Results**: State Vinogradov's theorem as an axiom, carefully explaining why it doesn't solve the original problem\n\n4. **Golden Ratio Case**: Study φ = (1+√5)/2 as a canonical example, proving it satisfies the hypotheses (α > 1, irrational)\n\n5. **Verified Examples**: Test the definition for specific rational α values to demonstrate behavior",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Domain vs Range question**: Vinogradov asks which n give primes ⌊nα⌋ (infinitely many). Erdős asks which primes p have ⌊pα⌋ prime (unknown).",
      "**Irrational scaling**: The restriction to irrational α is crucial - rational α would have periodic behavior that makes the question trivial or different.",
      "**Floor function barrier**: The floor operation 'loses information' about α, making it hard to connect multiplicative properties of primes to their scaled images.",
      "**Golden ratio**: φ is a natural test case due to its algebraic properties and connection to Fibonacci numbers."
