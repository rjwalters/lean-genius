Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\\lfloor p\\alpha\\rfloor$ is also prime?\n\n\n\nVinogradov \\cite{Vi48} proved that the sequence $\\{p\\alpha\\}$ is uniformly distributed for every irrational $\\alpha$, and hence there are infinitely many primes $p$ of the shape $p=\\lfloor n\\alpha\\rfloor$ for every irrational $\\alpha>1$. Indeed, this occurs if and only if\\[\\frac{p}{\\alpha}\\leq n<\\frac{p+1}{\\alpha},\\]which is true if and only if $\\{p\\alpha^{-1}\\}>1-\\alpha^{-1}$, which happens infinitely often by the uniform distribution of $\\{p\\alpha^{-1}\\}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Vi48] Vinogradov, I.
