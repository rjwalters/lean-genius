  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #432 was asked by Straus, inspired by Ostmann's related problem (#431). Discussed in Erdős–Graham (1980, p.85). The problem asks how dense a sumset A + B can be when all its elements are required to be pairwise coprime. Tao has noted this 'looks difficult.'",
    "problemStatement": "Let A, B ⊆ ℕ be infinite sets. How dense can A + B = {a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} be if all elements of A + B are pairwise coprime?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define sumsets, pairwise coprimality, and counting functions. The problem is formalized as finding a non-trivial upper bound on the counting function of A + B under the pairwise coprime constraint. Basic observations about prime factor uniqueness are axiomatized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Pairwise coprimality means each prime divides at most one element of A + B",
      "This severely restricts density: a pairwise coprime set in {1,…,n} has ≤ π(n) + 1 elements",
      "Related to Ostmann's problem (#431) about additive complements",
      "Tao noted this problem 'looks difficult'",
      "The sumset structure adds complexity beyond just coprime sets"
