    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether the density of integers whose k-th smallest prime factor equals p is unimodal as a function of p. He expected the answer is no but could not prove it. He showed the typical k-th prime factor is e^{e^k} while the density peaks at e^{(1+o(1))k}. Cambie resolved the question for k ≤ 20: unimodal for k ≤ 3, not for k ≥ 4.",
    "problemStatement": "For fixed k ≥ 1, is d_k(p) unimodal in p (non-decreasing then non-increasing along primes)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the k-th smallest prime factor, the density function (axiomatized), unimodality on primes, Cambie's results for k ≤ 3 and k ≥ 4, and Erdős's observations on typical values and the divisor analogue.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "d_1(p) is strictly decreasing (trivially unimodal): d_1(2) = 1/2, d_1(3) = 1/6, ...",
      "For k ≤ 3, unimodality holds (Cambie); for k ≥ 4, it fails",
      "Typical k-th prime factor is exp(exp(k)), but density peaks at exp((1+o(1))k)",
      "The analogous question for k-th smallest divisor has answer NO",
