Is it true that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $k$ has at least\\[\\binom{(r-1)(k-1)+1}{r}\\]edges, with equality only for the complete graph on $(r-1)(k-1)+1$ vertices?\n\n\n\nWhen $r=2$ it is a classical fact that chromatic number $k$ implies at least $\\binom{k}{2}$ edges. Erd\\H{o}s asked for $k$ to be large in this conjecture since he knew it to be false for $r=k=3$, as witnessed by the Steiner triples with $7$ vertices and $7$ edges.\n\nThis was disproved by Alon \\cite{Al85}, who proved, for example, that there exists some absolute constant $C>0$ such that if $r\\geq C$ and $k\\geq Cr$ then there exists an $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $\\geq k$ with at most\\[\\leq (7/8)^r\\binom{(r-1)(k-1)+1}{r}\\]many edges.\n\nIn general, Alon gave an upper bound for the minimal number of edges using Tur\\'{a}n numbers. Using known bounds for Tur\\'{a}n numbers then suffices to disprove this conjecture for all $r\\geq 4$. The validity of this conjecture for $r=3$ remains open.\n\nIf $m(r,k)$ denotes the minimal number of edges of any $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $>k$ then Akolzin and Shabanov \\cite{AkSh16} have proved\\[\\frac{r}{\\log r}k^r \\ll m(r,k) \\ll (r^3\\log r) k^r,\\]where the implied constants are absolute. Cherkashin and Petrov \\cite{ChPe20} have proved that, for fixed $r$, $m(r,k)/k^r$ converges to some limit as $k\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AkSh16] Akolzin, Ilia and Shabanov, Dmitry, Colorings of hypergraphs with large number of colors.
