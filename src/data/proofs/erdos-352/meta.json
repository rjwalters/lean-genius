  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem sits at the intersection of geometric measure theory and combinatorial geometry. It asks a fundamental question: how much measure is needed to guarantee the existence of a 'large' geometric configuration?\n\nErdős posed this problem in his papers [Er78d] (1978/79) and [Er83d] (1984). He proved two special cases: (1) sets of infinite measure contain unit triangles, and (2) unbounded sets of positive measure contain unit triangles. Both follow from the Lebesgue density theorem, which says that almost every point of a measurable set is a 'density point'.\n\nErdős conjectured that the optimal threshold is c = 4pi/sqrt(27) ≈ 2.418. This is witnessed by a circle of radius r = 2·3^{-3/4}: its area is exactly 4pi/sqrt(27), and the largest inscribed triangle is equilateral with area (3sqrt(3)/4)r^2 < 1. Freiling and Mauldin made significant progress, proving the conjecture for compact convex sets and for unions of at most 3 compact convex sets.",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdős Problem #352**: Is there some $c > 0$ such that every measurable $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$ of measure $\\geq c$ contains the vertices of a triangle of area 1?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Conjectured Answer**: YES, with $c = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{27}} \\approx 2.418$\n\n**Known Results**:\n- TRUE for infinite measure sets (Erdős, unpublished)\n- TRUE for unbounded sets of positive measure (Erdős, unpublished)\n- TRUE for compact convex sets (Freiling-Mauldin, 2002)\n- TRUE for unions of $\\leq 3$ compact convex interiors (Freiling-Mauldin)\n\n**Witness for Optimality**: A circle of radius $2 \\cdot 3^{-3/4}$ has area exactly $\\frac{4\\pi}{\\sqrt{27}}$ but contains no triangle of area 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Define triangle area**: Using the 2D cross product formula: Area = (1/2)|det([q-p, r-p])| = (1/2)|cross2D(q-p, r-p)|.\n\n2. **Define the main property**: ContainsUnitTriangle A means there exist p, q, r in A with triangleArea p q r = 1.\n\n3. **State the main question**: Does there exist c > 0 such that measure(A) >= c implies ContainsUnitTriangle A?\n\n4. **Define the conjectured constant**: erdosConstant = 4pi/sqrt(27).\n\n5. **Axiomatize known results**: Infinite measure case, unbounded case, Freiling-Mauldin results for compact convex sets.\n\n6. **Define the critical circle witness**: criticalRadius = 2·3^{-3/4}, showing the constant is optimal.\n\n7. **State the reduction**: Mauldin showed it suffices to prove for finite unions of compact convex interiors.",

      "**Why 4pi/sqrt(27)?**: This is the area of a circle of radius 2·3^{-3/4}. Inside such a circle, the largest inscribed triangle is equilateral with area exactly approaching 1 as the radius approaches the critical value.",
      "**Lebesgue density theorem**: A key tool - almost every point of a measurable set is a density point. This easily proves the infinite measure and unbounded cases.",
      "**Compact convex case**: Freiling-Mauldin proved the conjecture for compact convex sets. The non-convex case remains open.",
      "**Reduction to finite unions**: Mauldin showed the general problem reduces to unions of finitely many compact convex interiors. Freiling-Mauldin verified this for n <= 3.",
