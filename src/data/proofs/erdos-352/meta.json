This also proves the same threshold for the original problem under the assumption that $A$ is a compact convex set.\n\nMauldin also discusses this problem in \\cite{Ma13}, in which he notes that it suffices to prove this under the assumption that $A$ is the union of the interiors of $n<\\infty$ many compact convex sets. Freiling and Mauldin (see \\cite{Ma13}) have proved this conjecture if $1\\leq n\\leq 3$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er78d] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Set-theoretic, measure-theoretic, combinatorial, and\nnumber-theoretic problems concerning point sets in Euclidean\nspace.
