  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Sidon asked Erdős this question in 1932. Erdős proved existence using probabilistic methods, but the explicit construction remained open for 90+ years until Jain-Pham-Sawhney-Zakharov (2024).",
    "problemStatement": "Is there an explicit construction of a set A ⊆ ℕ such that A + A = ℕ (additive basis) but r_A(n) = o(n^ε) for every ε > 0 (economical)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sumsets, representation functions, and the economical condition. Key comparisons: ℕ is a basis but not economical (r(n) = n+1), Sidon sets are economical but not bases. The JPSZ construction achieves both properties with r_A(n) ≤ exp(C√(log n)).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Economical means subpolynomial representation count: r_A(n) = o(n^ε) for all ε > 0",
      "ℕ itself fails: r_ℕ(n) = n + 1 is linear, not subpolynomial",
      "Sidon sets (unique representations) are too thin to be bases",
      "JPSZ set is the 'Goldilocks' construction: thick enough to be a basis, thin enough to be economical",
      "The representation bound exp(C√(log n)) is subpolynomial for all ε > 0"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #29 is SOLVED. Jain-Pham-Sawhney-Zakharov (2024) gave the first explicit economical additive basis after 90+ years. The formalization includes verified proofs that ℕ is not economical, squares are not a basis, and Sidon sets cannot be bases.",
    "implications": "Transforms Erdős's probabilistic existence proof into a constructive algorithm. Demonstrates the power of modern combinatorics to resolve long-standing problems explicitly.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Can the representation bound exp(C√(log n)) be improved?",
      "What is the optimal density for economical bases?",
      "Are there simpler explicit constructions?"
