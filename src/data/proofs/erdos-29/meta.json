    "problemStatement": "Is there an explicit construction of a set $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ such that $A+A=\\mathbb{N}$ but $1_A\\ast 1_A(n)=o(n^\\epsilon)$ for every $\\epsilon>0$? The existence of such a set was asked by Sidon to Erdős in 1932. Erdős (eventually) proved the existence of such a set using probabilistic methods. This problem asks for a constructive solution. An explicit construction was given by Jain, Pham, Sawhney, and Zakharov [JPSZ24]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 December 2025.",
