Must the complement of $S$ contain four points which form a unit square?\n\n\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by Juh\\'{a}sz \\cite{Ju79}, who proved more generally that the complement of $S$ must contain a congruent copy of any set of four points. This is not true for arbitrarily large sets of points, but perhaps is still true for any set of five points.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ju79] Juh\\'{a}sz, Roz\\'{a}lia, Ramsey type theorems in the plane.
