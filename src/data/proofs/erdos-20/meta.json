  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Sunflower Conjecture is one of the most famous open problems in combinatorics. A sunflower (or delta-system) is a collection of sets where all pairwise intersections are identical - this common part is called the 'core'.\n\nErdős and Rado (1960) proved the Sunflower Lemma: any sufficiently large family of n-element sets contains a k-sunflower. Their bound was (k-1)^n · n!, but they conjectured that the n! factor is unnecessary.\n\nAfter 60 years of little progress, the 2020 breakthrough by Alweiss-Lovett-Wu-Zhang dramatically improved the bound. Rao further refined it to (Ck log n)^n - tantalizingly close to the conjectured c_k^n.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős-Rado, OPEN):** For each k ≥ 3, there exists c_k > 0 such that f(n,k) < c_k^n.\n\nHere f(n,k) is the minimum size such that every family of f(n,k) sets, each of size n, contains a k-sunflower.\n\n**Current best:**\n- Upper bound: (Ck log n)^n (Rao 2020)\n- Lower bound: (k-1)^n\n- Conjectured: c_k^n\n\n**The $1,000 prize** is specifically for the k=3 case.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `IsUniform F n`: family F has all sets of size n\n2. `IsSunflower petals k`: k sets with identical pairwise intersections\n3. `ContainsSunflower F k`: family F has a k-sunflower\n4. `sunflowerNumber n k`: minimum m guaranteeing sunflower (f(n,k))\n5. `SunflowerConjecture`: f(n,k) < c_k^n for all k ≥ 3\n\nWe axiomatize:\n- Erdős-Rado (1960): f(n,k) ≤ (k-1)^n · n!\n- Kostochka (1997): o(n!) improvement\n- ALWZ (2020): (Ck log n log log n)^n\n- Rao (2020): (Ck log n)^n (current best)",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The k=3 case:** Erdős said 'the whole difficulty' is in k=3. Solving this special case would be a major breakthrough.",
      "**2020 revolution:** After 60 years of stagnation, ALWZ reduced the bound from n! to (log n)^n - a massive improvement.",
      "**The remaining gap:** Current best is (Ck log n)^n. The conjecture asks for c_k^n. This (log n)^n factor is the last barrier.",
      "**Lower bound is tight:** f(n,k) ≥ (k-1)^n is achieved by constructions avoiding sunflowers.",
      "**Applications everywhere:** Sunflower bounds matter for matrix multiplication, circuit complexity, and property testing."
