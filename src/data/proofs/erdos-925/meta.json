  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #925**\n\nThis problem connects Ramsey theory to independent set sizes.\n\n**History:**\n- Erdős posed this problem, probably in the 1960s-70s\n- The \"easy\" result: non-Ramsey graphs have independent sets of size Ω(n^(1/3))\n- The question: can we improve this to n^(1/3+δ) for some δ > 0?\n- Equivalently: is R(3,3,m) ≪ m^(3-c) for some c > 0?\n\n**Resolution (Alon-Rödl 2005):**\nThe answer is NO. They proved:\n- Lower bound: R(3,3,m) ≥ m³/(log m)^(4+o(1))\n- Upper bound: R(3,3,m) ≤ m³(log log m)/(log m)²\n\nSudakov later improved the upper bound by removing the log log factor.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nIs there a constant δ > 0 such that, for all large n, if G is a graph on n vertices which is not Ramsey for K₃ (i.e., there exists a 2-coloring of the edges with no monochromatic triangle), then G contains an independent set of size ≫ n^(1/3+δ)?\n\n**Known:** Independent sets of size ≫ n^(1/3) always exist (easy).\n\n**Equivalent Question:** Is R(3,3,m) ≪ m^(3-c) for some c > 0?\n\n**Answer:** NO (Alon-Rödl 2005)\n\nThe n^(1/3) bound cannot be improved to n^(1/3+δ).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Basics:** Use SimpleGraph from Mathlib\n\n2. **Key Definitions:**\n   - isNotRamseyForTriangle: 2-coloring with no monochromatic K₃\n   - hasIndependentSetOfSize: independent set existence\n   - R_3_3: multicolor Ramsey number R(3,3,m)\n\n3. **The Conjecture:**\n   - erdos_925_conjecture: the original (false) conjecture\n   - erdos_925_ramsey_form: equivalent Ramsey formulation\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - alon_rodl_lower_bound: R(3,3,m) ≥ m³/(log m)^(4+o(1))\n   - alon_rodl_upper_bound: R(3,3,m) ≤ m³(log log m)/(log m)²\n   - sudakov_improvement: removes log log factor\n   - erdos_925_disproved: the conjecture is FALSE\n\n**Why Axioms:** The proofs involve probabilistic and algebraic methods beyond Mathlib.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #925 was disproved by Alon and Rödl in 2005. The answer is NO: non-Ramsey graphs on n vertices need not have independent sets larger than ~n^(1/3). The multicolor Ramsey number R(3,3,m) grows like m³/polylog(m), not like m^(3-c) for any c > 0.",
    "implications": "The result shows that the trivial n^(1/3) bound for independent sets in non-Ramsey graphs is essentially optimal. The precise bounds on R(3,3,m) involve only logarithmic factors, not polynomial improvements. This connects Ramsey theory to extremal graph theory.",
