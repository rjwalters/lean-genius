This was disproved by Alon and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{AlRo05}, who proved that\\[\\frac{1}{(\\log m)^{4+o(1)}}m^3 \\ll R(3,3,m) \\ll \\frac{\\log\\log m}{(\\log m)^2}m^3.\\]As reported in \\cite{AlRo05} Sudakov has observed that the $\\log\\log m$ in the upper bound can be removed.\n\nSee also [553].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AlRo05] Alon, Noga and R\\\"odl, Vojt\\v ech, Sharp bounds for some multicolor {R}amsey numbers.
