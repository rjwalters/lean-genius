  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Hermite proved e transcendental in 1873, making it the first 'natural' constant proven transcendental (Liouville's numbers were specifically constructed). This opened the door for Lindemann's proof of pi's transcendence 9 years later.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem**: e is transcendental, i.e., there is no nonzero polynomial P with integer coefficients such that P(e) = 0.\n\nThis is stronger than irrationality (proved by Euler) and even algebraic irrationality.",
    "proofStrategy": "Hermite's proof uses contour integration. Assume e is algebraic with minimal polynomial P. Construct an auxiliary integral that is simultaneously a non-zero integer and arbitrarily small (using factorial growth vs exponential), yielding a contradiction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The key is the interplay between factorial and exponential growth",
      "Hermite's method was generalized by Lindemann to e^alpha",
      "Transcendence is much stronger than irrationality",
