  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the relationship between two fundamental quantities for entire functions: the maximum term μ(r) = max_n |aₙ|rⁿ and the maximum modulus M(r) = max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|. For polynomials, μ(r)/M(r) → 1 as r → ∞. Erdős asked whether, for transcendental entire functions, this ratio must tend to 0 whenever the limit exists.\n\nClunie proved the answer is YES for functions with non-negative coefficients. However, Clunie and Hayman (1964) spectacularly disproved the general conjecture by constructing entire functions where μ(r)/M(r) → λ for any prescribed λ ∈ [0, 1/2]. The upper bound 1/2 is sharp and cannot be exceeded.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^n$ be an entire function (not a polynomial). Define:\n- **Maximum term**: $\\mu(r) = \\max_n |a_n| r^n$\n- **Maximum modulus**: $M(r) = \\max_{|z|=r} |f(z)|$\n\n**Question**: If $\\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\mu(r)}{M(r)}$ exists, must it equal 0?\n\n**Answer**: NO.\n\n**Clunie-Hayman (1964)**: The limit can take any value in $[0, 1/2]$, and this interval is sharp.\n\n**Status**: SOLVED (DISPROVED)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines EntireFunction as a structure carrying power series coefficients with the property that infinitely many are nonzero. maxTerm and maxModulus are defined as suprema. The Clunie-Hayman theorem is axiomatized: for any λ ∈ [0, 1/2], there exists an entire function with μ(r)/M(r) → λ. The upper bound 1/2 is also axiomatized. The original conjecture is proved false by taking λ = 1/4.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Dichotomy for positive coefficients**: Clunie proved that functions with aₙ ≥ 0 always have μ(r)/M(r) → 0. The counterexamples require oscillating signs.",
      "**The interval [0, 1/2] is complete**: Any λ ∈ [0, 1/2] is achievable, and the upper bound 1/2 cannot be exceeded.",
      "**Counterexamples are pathological**: The functions achieving λ > 0 are highly irregular and typically have infinite order.",
      "**Central index theory**: The maximum term is achieved at the 'central index' ν(r), which grows to ∞ as r → ∞.",
      "**Connection to growth**: Functions with μ(r)/M(r) → 0 are called 'normal'; this includes most classical entire functions like exp, sin, cos."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #227 asked whether the limit of μ(r)/M(r) (maximum term over maximum modulus) must be 0 when it exists. This was disproved by Clunie and Hayman (1964), who showed the limit can be any value in [0, 1/2]. The upper bound 1/2 is sharp.",
    "implications": "The result reveals a fundamental dichotomy in entire function theory: functions with positive coefficients behave 'normally' with μ/M → 0, while functions with oscillating signs can exhibit pathological behavior. This connects to questions about the distribution of zeros and the 'irregularity' of growth.",

      "What is the structure of entire functions achieving limit exactly 1/2?",
      "Can the results be extended to functions in several complex variables?",
