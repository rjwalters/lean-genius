  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Projective planes have been studied since the 19th century. The prime power conjecture asks whether all finite projective planes have prime power order. Bruck-Ryser (1949) gave a necessary condition, and Lam (1997) ruled out order 10 by computer search. Order 12 remains the smallest open case.",
    "problemStatement": "A finite projective plane of order n has n²+n+1 points, n²+n+1 lines, with n+1 points per line and n+1 lines per point. The Prime Power Conjecture asks: must n be a prime power? Planes exist for all prime powers via PG(2,q) construction.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization uses Mathlib's Configuration.ProjectivePlane type. Verified theorems include point/line counting, prime power status for small orders, and a complete Bruck-Ryser application ruling out order 6. The Lam result for order 10 and open status of order 12 are recorded as axioms.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #723 (Prime Power Conjecture) is OPEN in general. The formalization includes verified proofs that orders 1-5 are prime powers, a complete Bruck-Ryser application ruling out order 6, and records Lam's computational result for order 10. Order 12 remains the smallest unknown case.",
    "implications": "The conjecture connects finite geometry to number theory via the sum-of-squares condition. If a non-prime-power projective plane exists, it would require fundamentally new construction methods beyond finite fields.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does a projective plane of order 12 exist?",
      "Are there non-prime-power projective planes?",
      "Can Bruck-Ryser be strengthened?",
      "What is the next non-existence result after Lam?"
