This conjecture has been proved for $n\\leq 11$, but it is open whether there exists a projective plane of order $12$.\n\nBruck and Ryser \\cite{BrRy49} have proved that if $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{4}$ or $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$ then $n$ must be the sum of two squares. For example, this rules out $n=6$ or $n=14$. The case $n=10$ was ruled out by computer search \\cite{La97}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BrRy49] Bruck, R. H. and Ryser, H.
