    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in [Er94b] (1994). The question concerns the diversity of optimal point configurations in the plane.\n\nGiven n points with minimum pairwise separation 1, we seek configurations minimizing the diameter (largest distance). h(n) counts how many 'essentially different' (incongruent) optimal configurations exist.\n\nThe problem connects to classical circle packing - placing n non-overlapping unit circles in the smallest possible containing circle. The hexagonal lattice is optimal for large n (Thue-Minkowski).\n\nRelated to Erdős Problem #99. Even very weak versions of the conjecture remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet h(n) count the number of incongruent sets of n points in ℝ² that minimize the diameter subject to d(x,y) ≥ 1 for all distinct x,y.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that h(n) → ∞ as n → ∞?\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Points must be separated by distance at least 1\n- We minimize the diameter (max pairwise distance)\n- Two configurations are congruent if related by rigid motion\n- h(n) counts equivalence classes under congruence",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Point Configurations:** Define PointConfig as Fin n → ℝ × ℝ\n\n2. **Constraints:** HasMinSeparation requires all pairs at distance ≥ 1\n\n3. **Optimality:** IsOptimal means achieving minimum diameter\n\n4. **Congruence:** Define Isometry2D and AreCongruent relation\n\n5. **Counting:** Axiomatize h(n) as count of incongruent optimal configs\n\n6. **Conjecture:** ErdosConjecture103 states h(n) → ∞",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #103 asks whether the count h(n) of incongruent optimal point configurations (minimizing diameter with separation ≥ 1) tends to infinity. This is a counting problem about the diversity of optimal geometric configurations.",
    "implications": "Understanding h(n) would reveal whether optimal packings become increasingly diverse or eventually stabilize into a few canonical forms. A positive answer suggests rich geometric structure; if h(n) is bounded, there may be a universal limiting configuration.",

      "Does h(n) → ∞ as n → ∞?",
      "Is h(n) ≥ 2 for all sufficiently large n?",
      "Are there infinitely many n with h(n) ≥ 2?",
      "What is the growth rate of h(n) if unbounded?",
