  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #527, posed in 1961 (p. 254), concerns the behavior of random power series on the unit circle. Given a sequence of real coefficients aₙ with divergent sum of squares and |aₙ| = o(1/√n), Erdős asked whether random sign choices almost surely yield convergence at some point on the unit circle.\n\nThe problem sits at the intersection of harmonic analysis, probability theory, and fractal geometry. Dvoretzky and Erdős (1959) had established that if coefficients decay no faster than c/√n, the random series diverges everywhere on the unit circle for almost all sign choices. This showed that the decay condition |aₙ| = o(1/√n) is sharp — any slower decay destroys convergence entirely.\n\nThe problem remained open for over 60 years until Michelen and Sawhney (2025) resolved it affirmatively. Their proof showed not merely that convergence occurs somewhere, but that the convergence set has Hausdorff dimension 1 — the largest possible geometric size for a measure-zero subset of the circle. This dramatic result reveals that even when divergence dominates almost everywhere, convergence persists on a rich fractal set.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $a_n \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $\\sum_n |a_n|^2 = \\infty$ and $|a_n| = o(1/\\sqrt{n})$. Is it true that, for almost all choices of $\\epsilon_n = \\pm 1$, there exists some $z$ with $|z| = 1$ such that $\\sum_n \\epsilon_n a_n z^n$ converges?\n\n**Answer: YES.** Moreover, the set of such $z$ has Hausdorff dimension 1 (Michelen-Sawhney 2025).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization builds the problem from first principles using Mathlib's complex analysis and measure theory.\n\n1. **Definitions:** unitCircle, littleO_sqrt (the decay condition), divergentSquares, randomPowerSeries, and convergesAt capture the problem setup.\n\n2. **Probabilistic Framework:** signMeasure axiomatizes the product measure on {±1}^ℕ, and almostAllSigns defines probability-1 events.\n\n3. **Classical Results:** divergence_typical (generic divergence) and dvoretzky_erdos_1959 (sharp threshold) establish the context.\n\n4. **Main Results:** michelen_sawhney_2025 (nonempty convergence set a.s.) and hausdorff_dimension_one (dimH = 1 a.s.) are axiomatized.\n\n5. **Properties:** The convergence set is uncountable yet has measure zero — a fractal phenomenon.\n\n6. **Examples:** Concrete sequences like aₙ = 1/(√n log n) illustrate the hypotheses.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Divergence Dominates:** For a.e. signs and a.e. points on S¹, the series diverges when Σ|aₙ|² = ∞ — but convergence still occurs on a rich set",
      "**Sharp Threshold:** Dvoretzky-Erdős (1959) shows |aₙ| = o(1/√n) is exactly the right decay condition — any slower decay kills all convergence",
      "**Fractal Convergence Set:** The convergence set has Hausdorff dimension 1 (as large as the circle) but Lebesgue measure zero — a fractal phenomenon",
      "**Recent Resolution:** Solved in 2025 by Michelen and Sawhney after being open for over 60 years, using probabilistic analysis and metric geometry",
      "**Canonical Example:** aₙ = 1/(√n log n) satisfies both conditions — divergent squares and the o(1/√n) decay"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #527 is SOLVED by Michelen and Sawhney (2025). For coefficient sequences aₙ with Σ|aₙ|² = ∞ and |aₙ| = o(1/√n), almost all random sign choices yield a nonempty convergence set on the unit circle, and this set has Hausdorff dimension 1. The result resolves a problem open for over 60 years and reveals a striking fractal phenomenon: convergence persists on a geometrically rich set despite generic divergence.",
    "implications": "The result deepens our understanding of random power series and the interplay between harmonic analysis, probability, and fractal geometry. The sharp threshold at |aₙ| = o(1/√n), established by Dvoretzky-Erdős (1959), is now complemented by the full convergence picture above this threshold. The methods connect to metric entropy, martingale theory, and the geometry of Hausdorff dimension.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact structure (e.g., topological type) of the convergence set?",
      "What happens at the boundary case |aₙ| = c/√n for different constants c?",
      "Can the Hausdorff dimension be computed explicitly for specific coefficient sequences?",
      "What about higher moments — does Σ|aₙ|^p < ∞ for some p > 2 improve the result?"
