  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #527 asks about convergence of random power series on the unit circle. Dvoretzky-Erdős (1959) showed |aₙ| > c/√n implies divergence everywhere for a.e. signs. For Σ|aₙ|² = ∞, divergence is typical for a.e. z and a.e. signs. Michelen-Sawhney (2025) proved that with |aₙ| = o(1/√n), convergence occurs on a set of Hausdorff dimension 1.",
    "problemStatement": "Let aₙ with Σ|aₙ|² = ∞ and |aₙ| = o(1/√n). Is it true that for almost all choices of εₙ = ±1, there exists z with |z| = 1 such that Σ εₙaₙzⁿ converges? SOLVED: YES, and the convergence set has Hausdorff dimension 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines unitCircle, littleO_sqrt, divergentSquares, randomPowerSeries, and convergesAt. The probabilistic setup uses signMeasure and almostAllSigns. Classical results (divergence_typical, dvoretzky_erdos_1959) and the main Michelen-Sawhney results are axiomatized. Proved: erdos_527_main and erdos_527_strong using the axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Divergence is typical: for a.e. signs, the series diverges for a.e. |z| = 1",
      "Dvoretzky-Erdős (1959): |aₙ| > c/√n implies complete divergence on the circle",
      "The condition |aₙ| = o(1/√n) is precisely what allows a convergence set to exist",
      "Dimension 1: the convergence set is as large as possible geometrically while having measure zero",
      "Recent resolution: this Erdős problem was solved only in 2025 by Michelen and Sawhney"
