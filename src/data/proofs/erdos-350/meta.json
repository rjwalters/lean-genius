Ryavec's proof is reproduced in \\cite{BeEr74}. More generally, Ryavec's proof delivers that\\[\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}\\leq 2-2^{1-\\lvert A\\rvert},\\]with equality if and only if $A=\\{1,2,\\ldots,2^k\\}$.\n\nThe stronger statement that, for all $s\\geq 0$,\\[\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n^s} <\\frac{1}{1-2^{-s}},\\]was proved by Hanson, Steele, and Stenger \\cite{HSS77}.\n\nSee also [1].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BeEr74] Benkoski, S.
