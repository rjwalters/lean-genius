    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this three-part problem about the maximum modulus of monic polynomials with all roots on the unit circle. Wagner (1980) solved Part 1 showing limsup M_n = ∞ with logarithmic lower bounds. Beck (1991) solved Part 2 establishing polynomial growth M_n > N^c. Part 3, asking whether partial sums grow like n^{1+c}, remains open with a $100 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Given z_1,...,z_n on the unit circle, let M_n = max_{|z|=1} |∏(z-z_i)|. Is it true that ∑_{k≤n} M_k > n^{1+c} for some c > 0 and all large n?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define unitCirclePoly as the finite product ∏_{i<n}(w - z_i) and maxModulus as the supremum of its norm over the unit circle. Parts 1 and 2 (solved) are stated as axioms. Part 3 (open) is stated as ErdosProblem119 using Filter.Eventually. Implication relationships part3 ⟹ part2 ⟹ part1 are stated as axioms.",

      "Wagner's logarithmic bound (1980) and Beck's polynomial bound (1991) resolved Parts 1-2",
      "The open Part 3 asks about cumulative growth of M_k, a fundamentally harder question",
