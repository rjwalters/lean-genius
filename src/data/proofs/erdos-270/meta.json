Is it true that\\[\\sum_{n\\geq 1} \\frac{1}{(n+1)\\cdots (n+f(n))}\\]is irrational?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham write 'the answer is almost surely in the affirmative if $f(n)$ is assumed to be nondecreasing'. Even the case $f(n)=n$ is unknown, although Hansen \\cite{Ha75} has shown that\\[\\sum_n \\frac{1}{\\binom{2n}{n}}=\\sum_n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)\\cdots (n+n)}=\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{2\\pi}{3^{5/2}}\\]is transcendental.\n\nCrmari\\'{c} and Kova\\v{c} \\cite{CrKo25} have shown that the answer to this question is no in a strong sense: for any $\\alpha \\in (0,\\infty)$ there exists a function $f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$ and\\[\\sum_{n\\geq 1} \\frac{1}{(n+1)\\cdots (n+f(n))}=\\alpha.\\]It is still possible that this sum is always irrational if $f$ is assumed to be non-decreasing; Crmari\\'{c} and Kova\\v{c} show that the set of the possible values of such a sum has Lebesgue measure zero.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CrKo25] T.
