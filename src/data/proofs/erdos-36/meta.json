  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1955. He initially conjectured c = 1/2, which was later disproved. The problem has attracted sustained interest from combinatorialists, with bounds steadily improving over decades. White (2022) made a major advance using Fourier analysis.",
    "problemStatement": "Partition {1, ..., 2N} into two sets A, B of size N. For each k, count pairs (a,b) with a ∈ A, b ∈ B, a−b = k. Let M(N) = min over partitions of max overlap. Determine c = lim M(N)/N.",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize the overlap function, M(N), and the asymptotic constant. We state the known bounds 0.379005 < c < 0.380876 and record small values of M(N).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Erdős originally conjectured c = 1/2, which was disproved",
      "Best known bounds: 0.379005 < c < 0.380876",
      "White (2022) used Fourier analysis and convex optimization for the lower bound",
      "Haugland (2016) used step functions for the upper bound",
      "Small values: M(1)=1, M(2)=1, M(3)=2, M(4)=2, M(5)=3"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The minimum overlap problem asks for the exact asymptotic constant c = lim M(N)/N where M(N) is the minimum maximum overlap in equal partitions of {1,...,2N}. The constant is pinned between 0.379005 and 0.380876 but its exact value remains unknown.",
    "implications": "Determining c would resolve a fundamental question in additive combinatorics about the unavoidable structure in equal partitions of consecutive integers. The Fourier-analytic methods developed for this problem have broader applications.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact value of c = lim M(N)/N?",
      "Can the gap between 0.379005 and 0.380876 be further narrowed?",
      "Is c algebraic or transcendental?",
      "What is the optimal partition structure achieving M(N)?"
