What is the largest $t$ such that there are $A_1,\\ldots,A_t\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ with $A_i\\cap A_j$ a non-empty arithmetic progression for all $i\\neq j$?\n\n\n\nSimonovits and S\\'{o}s \\cite{SiSo81} have shown that $t\\ll N^2$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham asked whether the maximal $t$ is achieved when we take the $A_i$ to be all arithmetic progressions in $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ containing some fixed element, 'presumably the integer $\\lfloor N/2\\rfloor$'. This was disproved by Simonovits and S\\'{o}s \\cite{SiSo81}, who observed that taking all sets containing at most $3$ elements, containing some fixed element, produces $\\binom{N}{2}+1$ many such sets, which is asymptotically greater than the number of arithmetic progressions containing a fixed element, which is $\\sim \\frac{\\pi^2}{24}N^2$.\n\nIf we drop the non-empty requirement then Graham, Simonovits, and S\\'{o}s \\cite{GSS80} have shown that\\[t\\leq \\binom{N}{3}+\\binom{N}{2}+\\binom{N}{1}+1\\]and this is best possible.\n\nSzabo \\cite{Sz99} proved that the maximal such $t$ is equal to\\[\\frac{N^2}{2}+O(N^{5/3}(\\log N)^3),\\]resolving the asymptotic question. On the other hand, Szabo showed that the conjecture of Simonovits and S\\'{o}s that $\\binom{n}{2}+1$ is best possible is false, giving a construction which yields\\[t \\geq \\binom{N}{2}+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{4}\\right\\rfloor+1.\\]Szabo conjectures that the asymptotic $t=\\binom{N}{2}+O(N)$ holds, and that in any extremal example there is an integer contained in all sets.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GSS80] Graham, R.
