    "historicalContext": "**Packing Monochromatic Triangles**\n\nThis problem sits at the intersection of Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory. While Ramsey's theorem guarantees monochromatic cliques in edge-colorings, this problem asks a quantitative packing question: how many edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles must exist?\n\n**The Extremal Construction**: The conjectured bound n²/12 comes from a natural construction. Partition vertices into two equal halves, color all edges between halves red, and all edges within halves blue. Each color class is a balanced complete bipartite graph (no triangles between halves) or two disjoint cliques of size n/2. The blue triangles can be packed to get roughly (n/2)²/6 ≈ n²/24 triangles from each half, totaling n²/12.\n\n**The Conjecture**: Erdős, Faudree, and Ordman conjectured this construction is worst-case optimal - any 2-coloring must contain at least this many edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles.\n\n**Resolution**: Gruslys and Letzter confirmed this in their 2020 paper 'Monochromatic triangle packings in red-blue graphs'.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIs it true that in any 2-coloring of the edges of K_n there must exist at least (1+o(1))n²/12 many edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles?\n\n**Key Definitions**:\n- **Edge-disjoint**: No two triangles share an edge\n- **Monochromatic**: All three edges of the triangle have the same color\n- **2-coloring**: Each edge is colored red or blue\n\n**Answer**: YES. The bound n²/12 is asymptotically tight, achieved by the balanced bipartition coloring.\n\n**Related Question**: Erdős also asked about maximizing monochromatic triangles in a single color, conjecturing ≥ cn² for some c > 1/24.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach (Gruslys-Letzter 2020)**\n\nThe proof uses sophisticated techniques from extremal combinatorics:\n\n1. **Regularity Framework**: Apply a variant of Szemerédi's regularity lemma to decompose the colored graph into structured pieces.\n\n2. **Triangle Removal**: Analyze how triangles distribute across regular pairs and handle irregular parts.\n\n3. **Greedy Packing with Absorption**: Use a combination of greedy triangle selection and absorption methods to build a large edge-disjoint collection.\n\n4. **Balancing Colors**: Show that the total count from both colors together achieves the n²/12 bound, even if one color contributes less.\n\n5. **Handling the o(1) Term**: Carefully track error terms from regularity to achieve the asymptotic result.\n\n**Key Insight**: The extremal coloring 'wastes' edges by creating large bipartite regions (no triangles), but this is the only way to minimize the triangle packing count.",
