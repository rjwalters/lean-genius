This would be best possible, as witnessed by dividing the vertices of $K_n$ into two equal parts and colouring all edges between the parts red and all edges inside the parts blue.\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by Gruslys and Letzter \\cite{GrLe20}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er97d} Erd\\H{o}s also asks for a lower bound for the count of edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles in single colour (the colour chosen to maximise this quantity), and speculates that the answer is $\\geq cn^2$ for some constant $c>1/24$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er97d] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some recent problems and results in graph theory.
