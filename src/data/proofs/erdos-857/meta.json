In \\cite{Er70} Erd\\H{o}s asks this in the equivalent formulation with intersection replaced by union.\n\nThis is sometimes known as the weak sunflower problem (see [20] for the strong sunflower problem).\n\nWhen $k=3$ this is strongly connected to the cap set problem (finding the maximal size of subsets of $\\mathbb{F}_3^n$ with no three-term arithmetic progressions), as observed by Alon, Shpilka, and Umans \\cite{ASU13}). Naslund and Sawin \\cite{NaSa17} have proved that\\[m(n,3) \\leq (3/2^{2/3})^{(1+o(1))n}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ASU13] Alon, Noga and Shpilka, Amir and Umans, Christopher, On sunflowers and matrix multiplication.
