    "historicalContext": "This $100 Erdős problem was posed by Burr, Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1989). Parsons (1975) gave the upper bound and exact values for special n. The problem is connected to prime gaps: under Cramér's conjecture, the bounds tighten significantly.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine R(C₄, Sₙ), where C₄ is the 4-cycle and Sₙ = K_{1,n} is the star on n+1 vertices. In particular: for any c > 0, are there infinitely many n with R(C₄, Sₙ) ≤ n + √n - c?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize cycle and star graphs, the Ramsey number definition, known bounds (Parsons upper, BEFRS lower), exact values for n = q² ± t, and the connection to prime gaps via Cramér's conjecture.",

      "Exact: n = q² + 1 gives R = n + ⌈√n⌉, n = q² gives R = n + ⌈√n⌉ + 1",
      "All known values are n + ⌈√n⌉ or n + ⌈√n⌉ + 1",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #552, a $100 problem on R(C₄, Sₙ). The bounds n + √n - O(n^{11/40}) < R < n + ⌈√n⌉ + 1 are known, but the exact asymptotic behavior depends on prime gaps. The question of whether R ≤ n + √n - c for infinitely many n remains open.",
