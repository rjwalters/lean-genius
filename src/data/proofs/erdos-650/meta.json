    "proofStrategy": "We formalize valid sets, intervals, coverings with distinct witnesses, the function f(m), the Erdős-Sarányi lower bound, the open upper bound conjecture, small cases, divisibility structure, greedy algorithms, probabilistic approaches, extremal sets, related functions, and asymptotic analysis.",
