  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Chen-Erdős Conjecture**\n\nChen and Erdős asked whether diversity in degree sequences forces large homogeneous subgraphs. If a graph has many distinct degrees (> (1/2 + ε)n) with each degree appearing at most twice, must it contain a clique or independent set much larger than log n?\n\n**Resolution**: Cambie, Chan, and Hunter disproved the conjecture by constructing graphs with ≥ 3n/4 distinct degrees (each appearing at most twice) where the largest trivial subgraph has size only O(log n).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet G be a graph on n vertices where:\n- Every degree occurs at most twice\n- The number of distinct degrees > (1/2 + ε)n\n\nMust G contain a trivial (empty or complete) subgraph of size 'much larger' than log n?\n\n**Status**: DISPROVED (Cambie-Chan-Hunter)\n\n**Answer**: NO - The counterexample achieves ≥ 3n/4 distinct degrees with max trivial size O(log n).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Counterexample Construction (Cambie-Chan-Hunter)**\n\n1. **Construction**: Build graphs with carefully chosen edges to maximize distinct degrees while limiting clique/independent set sizes.\n\n2. **Key Properties**:\n   - At least 3n/4 distinct degrees\n   - Each degree appears at most twice\n   - Largest trivial subgraph has size O(log n)\n\n3. **Why It Works**: Degree diversity does not correlate with Ramsey-type structure - one can have very diverse degrees while still avoiding large homogeneous sets.",
