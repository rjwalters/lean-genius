Must $G$ contain a trivial (empty or complete) subgraph of size 'much larger' than $\\log n$?\n\n\n\nA question of Chen and Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nThe answer is no - Cambie, Chan, and Hunter have in the commment section given a simple construction of a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\\frac{3}{4}n$ distinct degrees, every degree appears at most twice, and the largest trivial subgraph has size $O(\\log n)$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
