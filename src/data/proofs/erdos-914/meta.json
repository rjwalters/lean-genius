    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #914: Hajnal-Szemerédi Theorem**\n\nThis problem asks when a graph contains many vertex-disjoint cliques. It's one of the most important results in extremal graph theory about spanning substructures.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **r = 2:** Follows from Dirac's theorem (1952) on Hamiltonian cycles\n- **r = 3:** Proved by Corrádi and Hajnal (1963) for triangles\n- **r ≥ 4:** Proved by Hajnal and Szemerédi (1970) in a landmark paper\n- **2008:** Kierstead-Kostochka gave a shorter proof via equitable colorings\n- **2010:** Polynomial-time algorithm found (O(n^5))",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet r ≥ 2 and m ≥ 1. Every graph with rm vertices and minimum degree at least m(r-1) contains m vertex-disjoint copies of K_r.\n\n**Solution (Hajnal-Szemerédi 1970):**\nYES! The conjecture is true. The minimum degree condition δ(G) ≥ m(r-1) guarantees the existence of m vertex-disjoint r-cliques.\n\n**Equivalent Form:**\nA graph G on n vertices with δ(G) ≥ (1 - 1/r)n has a perfect K_r-factor when r divides n.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Setup:** Use Mathlib's SimpleGraph with minimum degree definition.\n\n2. **Clique Definitions:** Define r-cliques and vertex-disjoint clique collections.\n\n3. **Special Cases:** Axiomatize Dirac (r=2) and Corrádi-Hajnal (r=3).\n\n4. **Main Theorem:** Axiomatize Hajnal-Szemerédi for general r.\n\n5. **Tightness:** Show the minimum degree condition is optimal.\n\n6. **Generalizations:** State Alon-Yuster and KSS theorems.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Minimum Degree Threshold:** δ(G) ≥ m(r-1) = (1 - 1/r)n is exactly the right condition",
      "**Tightness:** The bound is tight - examples exist with one fewer degree and no K_r-factor",
      "**Spanning Structure:** Unlike Turán, this forces SPANNING structures, not just subgraphs",
      "**Equitable Colorings:** Modern proofs use the connection to graph colorings",
      "**Algorithmic:** Polynomial-time algorithms exist to find the clique factor",
      "**Generalizations:** Extends to perfect H-factors for any graph H (Alon-Yuster, KSS)"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #914 asks whether every graph on rm vertices with minimum degree ≥ m(r-1) contains m vertex-disjoint K_r's.
