  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #985 asks a fundamental question at the intersection of two basic concepts in number theory: primitive roots and prime numbers. A primitive root modulo a prime p is a generator of the multiplicative group (Z/pZ)*, meaning its powers produce all nonzero residues modulo p.\n\nThe question is whether there always exists a prime q < p that serves as a primitive root modulo p. This is verified computationally for all tested primes, but a proof remains elusive.\n\nThe problem connects to Artin's conjecture, which predicts that 2 is a primitive root for infinitely many primes. Hooley (1967) proved this assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Heath-Brown (1986) proved unconditionally that at least one of 2, 3, or 5 is a primitive root for infinitely many primes.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nIs it true that for every prime $p > 2$, there exists a prime $q < p$ which is a primitive root modulo $p$?\n\n**Definition**: A primitive root $g$ modulo $p$ satisfies $\\text{ord}_p(g) = p-1$, meaning $g$ generates $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$.\n\n**Examples**:\n- $p = 7$: $q = 3$ is a primitive root (order 6)\n- $p = 11$: $q = 2$ is a primitive root (order 10)\n- $p = 17$: $q = 3$ is a primitive root (order 16)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Primitive Roots**: Define IsPrimitiveRoot using Mathlib's orderOf in ZMod p\n2. **Main Conjecture**: State as erdos_985_conjecture with quantifiers over primes\n3. **Verified Examples**: Use native_decide to verify primitive root orders for small primes\n4. **Constructive Proofs**: Exhibit specific prime primitive roots for p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23\n5. **Related Results**: Axiomatize Heath-Brown's theorem and Artin's conjecture\n6. **OEIS Connection**: Define leastPrimePrimitiveRoot (sequence A103309)",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Why primitive roots exist**: Gauss proved (Z/pZ)* is cyclic for prime p, so generators (primitive roots) always exist. There are exactly φ(p-1) of them.",
      "**The hard part**: Proving that among the φ(p-1) primitive roots, at least one less than p is prime. This requires understanding how primes distribute among primitive roots.",
      "**Heath-Brown's breakthrough**: The unconditional result that 2, 3, or 5 works infinitely often is a major achievement, but doesn't settle Erdős #985.",
      "**Computational evidence**: OEIS A103309 gives the least prime primitive root for each prime. The conjecture is verified to very large bounds.",
      "**Artin's constant**: Heuristically, about 37.39% of primes should have 2 as a primitive root. Similar densities apply to other small primes."
