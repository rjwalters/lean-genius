    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #985: Prime Primitive Roots**\n\nThis problem asks whether every odd prime p admits a prime primitive root less than itself.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Artin (1927): Conjectured that any non-square integer is a primitive root for infinitely many primes\n- Hooley (1967): Proved Artin's conjecture assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis\n- Heath-Brown (1986): Proved unconditionally that at least one of 2, 3, or 5 is a primitive root for infinitely many primes\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nA primitive root modulo p is an integer g whose multiplicative order equals p - 1. This means g generates the entire multiplicative group (ℤ/pℤ)×. Erdős's question asks specifically for PRIME primitive roots, a natural but difficult restriction.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nIs it true that, for every prime p > 2, there is a prime q < p which is a primitive root modulo p?\n\n**Status: OPEN**\n\nThe conjecture has been verified computationally for many small primes, but no general proof or counterexample is known.\n\n**Related Result (Heath-Brown 1986):**\nAt least one of 2, 3, or 5 is a primitive root for infinitely many primes. This is the strongest unconditional result toward Artin's conjecture.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Primitive Root Definition:** Define ord_p(g) = p - 1 using Mathlib's orderOf\n\n2. **Prime Primitive Root:** q is prime and a primitive root modulo p\n\n3. **Verified Examples:** Computationally verify the conjecture for p = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 23 using native_decide\n\n4. **Related Results:** Axiomatize Heath-Brown's theorem and Artin's conjecture\n\n5. **Main Conjecture:** State Erdős 985 as an axiom (open problem)\n\n6. **Connections:** Show how Artin's conjecture would imply Erdős 985",
