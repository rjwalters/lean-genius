Let $f(n)$ count the number of possible such $A$.\n\nProve that $f(n)=o(2^n)$.\n\nProve that $f(n)/2^{n/2}\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and Faudree, who showed that $2^{n/2}<f(n) \\leq 2^{n-2}$. The first problem was solved by Verstra\\\"{e}te \\cite{Ve04}, who proved\\[f(n)\\ll 2^{n-n^{1/10}}.\\]This was improved by Nenadov \\cite{Ne25} to\\[f(n) \\ll 2^{n-n^{1/2-o(1)}}.\\]One can also ask about the existence and value of $\\lim f(n)^{1/n}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ne25] R.
