    "historicalContext": "**What Cycle Lengths Can a Graph Have?**\n\nEvery graph has a 'cycle set' - the set of lengths of cycles it contains. For a graph on n vertices, this is a subset of {3, 4, ..., n}. But not every subset is achievable! This problem asks: how many distinct cycle sets are possible?\n\n**The Bounds**: Erdős and Faudree established 2^{n/2} < f(n) ≤ 2^{n-2}, where f(n) counts achievable cycle sets. The upper bound 2^{n-2} is trivial (subsets of {3,...,n}), but the lower bound requires construction.\n\n**The Two-Part Problem**:\n1. Prove f(n) = o(2^n) - SOLVED by Verstraëte (2004)\n2. Prove f(n)/2^{n/2} → ∞ - OPEN\n\n**Recent Progress**: Nenadov (2025) improved the upper bound to f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/2-o(1)}}, a significant improvement over Verstraëte's 2^{n - n^{1/10}}.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nThe cycle set of a graph G on n vertices is A ⊆ {3,...,n} where ℓ ∈ A iff G contains a cycle of length ℓ. Let f(n) count the number of possible cycle sets.\n\n**Part 1**: Prove that f(n) = o(2^n)\n**Status**: SOLVED (Verstraëte 2004)\n\n**Part 2**: Prove that f(n)/2^{n/2} → ∞\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Known Bounds**:\n- Lower: f(n) > 2^{n/2} (Erdős-Faudree)\n- Upper: f(n) ≤ 2^{n-2} (trivial)\n- Upper: f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/2-o(1)}} (Nenadov 2025)\n\n**Related Question**: Does lim f(n)^{1/n} exist?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Known Techniques**\n\n**For Part 1 (Solved)**:\nVerstraëte's proof shows that cycle sets have structural constraints. Not all subsets of {3,...,n} can be cycle sets - there are 'forbidden patterns' of cycle lengths.\n\n**Upper Bound Improvements**:\n1. Verstraëte (2004): f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/10}}\n2. Nenadov (2025): f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/2-o(1)}}\n\n**The Gap**: The gap between 2^{n/2} and 2^{n - √n} is still enormous. The true growth rate of f(n) remains unknown.\n\n**For Part 2 (Open)**:\nTo prove f(n)/2^{n/2} → ∞, one must construct more cycle sets than the 2^{n/2} lower bound suggests. This requires understanding which subsets are achievable.",
