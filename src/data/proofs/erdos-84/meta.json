  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the 'cycle set' of a graph - the set of lengths of cycles that occur. Erdős and Faudree asked how many distinct cycle sets are achievable for graphs on n vertices. They established bounds 2^{n/2} < f(n) ≤ 2^{n-2}.\n\nVerstraëte (2004) solved Part 1 by showing f(n) = o(2^n), with the bound f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/10}}. This proves that not all subsets of {3,...,n} can be cycle sets. Nenadov (2025) dramatically improved this to f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/2-o(1)}}.\n\nPart 2 - whether f(n)/2^{n/2} → ∞ - remains open, as does the question of whether lim f(n)^{1/n} exists.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (PARTIALLY SOLVED)**\n\nThe cycle set of a graph G on n vertices is A ⊆ {3,...,n} where ℓ ∈ A iff G contains a cycle of length ℓ. Let f(n) count the number of achievable cycle sets.\n\n**Part 1:** Prove f(n) = o(2^n)\n**Status:** SOLVED (Verstraëte 2004)\n\n**Part 2:** Prove f(n)/2^{n/2} → ∞\n**Status:** OPEN\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: f(n) > 2^{n/2} (Erdős-Faudree)\n- Upper: f(n) ≪ 2^{n - n^{1/2-o(1)}} (Nenadov 2025)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cycle sets and the counting function f(n). Verstraëte's theorem is axiomatized for Part 1, along with Nenadov's improved bound. We formalize both parts of the problem statement, marking Part 2 as open. The key insight - that structural constraints limit achievable cycle sets - is captured through the structural_constraint axiom.",
