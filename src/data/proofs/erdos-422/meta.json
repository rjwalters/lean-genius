  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Hofstadter proposed this sequence and communicated it to Erdős, who included it in the Erdős–Graham (1980) monograph. The self-referential recursion makes it one of the most mysterious sequences in combinatorial number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Define f(1)=f(2)=1, f(n) = f(n−f(n−1))+f(n−f(n−2)) for n > 2. Is f well-defined for all n? Does it miss infinitely many integers?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the recursion, the well-definedness condition, and state the main open questions as axioms. Known initial values are recorded.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "It is not even known if f(n) is well-defined for all n",
      "The sequence begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, ... (OEIS A005185)",
      "The recursion is self-referential: indices depend on earlier values",
      "Whether f misses infinitely many integers is unknown",
      "Growth rate and eventual constancy are both open"

  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #422 concerns a Hofstadter-type sequence whose most basic properties — well-definedness, surjectivity, growth — are all unknown. The self-referential recursion resists standard analysis techniques.",
    "implications": "Understanding this sequence would shed light on self-referential recursive dynamics, a notoriously difficult area at the boundary of number theory and dynamical systems.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is f(n) well-defined for all n?",
      "Does f miss infinitely many positive integers?",
