Must $G$ contain every tree on at most $n/2$ vertices?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s, F\\\"{u}redi, Loebl, and S\\'{o}s. Ajtai, Koml\\'{o}s, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{AKS95} proved an asymptotic version, where at least $(1+\\epsilon)n/2$ vertices have degree at least $(1+\\epsilon)n/2$ (and $n$ is sufficiently large depending on $\\epsilon$).\n\nZhao \\cite{Zh11} has proved this conjecture holds for all sufficiently large $n$.\n\nKoml\\'{o}s and S\\'{o}s conjectured the generalisation that if at least $n/2$ vertices have degree at least $k$ then $G$ contains any tree with $k$ vertices.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AKS95] Ajtai, Mikl\\'{o}s and Koml\\'{o}s, J\\'{a}nos and Szemer\\'{e}di, Endre, On a conjecture of Loebl.
