Let $c(n)$ be the maximum number of minimal cuts a graph on $n$ vertices can have.\n\nDoes $c(n)^{1/n}\\to \\alpha$ for some $\\alpha <2$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, who also ask whether $c(3m+2)=3^m$. Seymour observed that $c(3m+2)\\geq 3^m$, as seen by the graph of $m$ independent paths of length $4$ joining two vertices.\n\nSolved by Brada\\v{c} \\cite{Br24}, who proved that $\\alpha=\\lim c(n)^{1/n}$ exists and\\[\\alpha \\leq 2^{H(1/3)}=1.8899\\cdots,\\]where $H(\\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. Seymour's construction proves that $\\alpha\\geq 3^{1/3}=1.442\\cdots$. Brada\\v{c} conjectures that this lower bound is the true value of $\\alpha$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Br24] D.
