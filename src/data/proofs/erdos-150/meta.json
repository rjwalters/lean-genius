    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #150**\n\nThis problem concerns extremal graph theory and the structure of vertex cuts in graphs.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdos and Nesetril: Posed the original question about minimal cuts\n- Seymour: Provided the key lower bound construction using paths\n- Bradac (2024): Solved the problem, proving alpha exists and alpha < 2\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- A minimal cut is an inclusion-minimal set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph\n- c(n) = maximum number of minimal cuts over all n-vertex graphs\n- The question asks about the asymptotic growth rate c(n)^{1/n}",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nA minimal cut of a graph is a minimal set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. Let c(n) be the maximum number of minimal cuts a graph on n vertices can have.\n\nDoes c(n)^{1/n} converge to some alpha < 2?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nBradac (2024) proved:\n1. The limit alpha = lim c(n)^{1/n} exists\n2. alpha <= 2^{H(1/3)} = 1.8899...\n3. Combined with Seymour's lower bound: 3^{1/3} <= alpha <= 2^{H(1/3)}\n\nBradac conjectures the true value is alpha = 3^{1/3} = 1.442...",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define vertex cuts using SimpleGraph.induce and connectivity\n\n2. **Key Functions:**\n   - isVertexCut: removal disconnects the graph\n   - isMinimalCut: no proper subset is also a cut\n   - maxMinimalCuts c(n): supremum over all n-vertex graphs\n\n3. **Seymour's Construction:** Axiomatize c(3m+2) >= 3^m from m independent paths\n\n4. **Binary Entropy:** Define H(p) for the upper bound 2^{H(1/3)}\n\n5. **Main Results:** Axiomatize Bradac's theorem on limit existence and upper bound\n\n6. **Bounds:** Combine to show 3^{1/3} <= alpha <= 2^{H(1/3)} < 2",

    "summary": "Erdos Problem #150 asked whether c(n)^{1/n} converges to some alpha < 2, where c(n) is the maximum number of minimal vertex cuts in an n-vertex graph. The answer is YES, proved by Bradac in 2024. The limit alpha exists and satisfies 3^{1/3} <= alpha <= 2^{H(1/3)}, approximately 1.442 to 1.890. Bradac conjectures that alpha = 3^{1/3}, which would mean Seymour's construction is optimal.",
    "implications": "**Graph-Theoretic Connections**\n\n1. **Vertex Connectivity:** Minimal cuts measure the structure of graph separators\n\n2. **Extremal Bounds:** The result establishes tight asymptotic growth for minimal cuts\n\n3. **Entropy Methods:** The binary entropy function appears naturally in the upper bound\n\n4. **Path Constructions:** Seymour's elegant construction using parallel paths is potentially optimal\n\n5. **Open Gap:** The gap between 1.442 and 1.890 remains to be closed",
