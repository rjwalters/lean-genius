    "historicalContext": "Euler proved this result in 1737, showing that primes are 'dense enough' for their reciprocals to diverge. This is a remarkable strengthening of Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of primes.\n\nEuler's proof used the connection between the harmonic series and the product over primes (Euler's product formula). The divergence shows that primes, while becoming sparser, don't thin out too quickly.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euler, 1737)**: The sum of reciprocals of prime numbers diverges:\n\n$$\\sum_{p \\text{ prime}} \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\cdots = \\infty$$\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #81.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Erdos's Elementary Proof**:\n\n1. Assume for contradiction that the sum converges to S\n2. Define 'smooth numbers' (those with all prime factors <= k)\n3. Estimate the count of smooth numbers up to n\n4. If the sum converges, there are 'too few' smooth numbers\n5. But we can also show there are 'enough' smooth numbers\n6. Contradiction!",
