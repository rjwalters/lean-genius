We say that an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $m$ colours is balanced if every vertex sees exactly $\\lfloor n/m\\rfloor$ many edges of each colours.\n\nFor which graphs $G$ is it true that, if $m=e(G)$, for all large $n\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, every balanced edge-colouring of $K_n$ with $m$ colours contains a rainbow copy of $G$? (That is, a subgraph isomorphic to $G$ where each edge receives a different colour.)\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er91} Erd\\H{o}s credits this problem to himself, Pyber, and Tuza. This problem was explored in a paper of Erd\\H{o}s and Tuza \\cite{ErTu93}. In \\cite{Er96} Erd\\H{o}s seems to suggest that this might be true for every graph $G$, and specifically asks specific challenge posed in \\cite{Er91} and \\cite{Er96} is whether, in any balanced edge-colouring of $K_{6n+1}$ by $6$ colours there must exist a rainbow $C_6$ and $K_4$.\n\nIn general, one can ask for a quantitative version, defining $d_G(n)$ to be minimal (if it exists) such that if $n$ is sufficiently large and the edges of $K_n$ are coloured with $e(G)$ many colours such that the minimum degree of each colour class is $\\geq d_G(n)$ then there is a rainbow copy of $G$. Erd\\H{o}s and Tuza \\cite{ErTu93} proved that\\[\\lfloor n/6\\rfloor \\leq d_{C_4}(n) \\leq \\left(\\frac{1}{4}-c\\right)n\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nAxenovich and Clemen \\cite{AxCl24} have proved that there exist infinitely many graphs without this property. In particular, they show that for any odd $\\ell \\geq 3$ and $m=\\lfloor \\sqrt{\\ell}+3.5\\rfloor$ there exist arbitrarily large $n$ such that $K_n$ has a balanced edge-colouring using $\\ell$ colours which contains no rainbow $K_m$. They conjecture that $K_m$ lacks this property for all $m\\geq 4$.\n\nClemen and Wagner \\cite{ClWa23} proved that $K_4$ does lack this property.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AxCl24] Axenovich, Maria and Clemen, Felix C., Rainbow subgraphs in edge-colored complete graphs: answering\ntwo questions by {E}rd\\H{o}s and {T}uza.
