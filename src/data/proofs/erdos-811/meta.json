  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #811 concerns rainbow subgraphs in balanced edge-colorings. The problem was posed by Erdős, Pyber, and Tuza (1991). A balanced coloring of K_n with m colors requires each vertex to see exactly ⌊n/m⌋ edges of each color (only possible when n ≡ 1 mod m). A rainbow subgraph uses each color at most once. The question asks which graphs G are guaranteed to appear as rainbow subgraphs in every balanced coloring of K_n. Recent work by Clemen-Wagner (2023) and Axenovich-Clemen (2024) has resolved some cases negatively.",
    "problemStatement": "For which graphs G is it true that if m = e(G), for all large n ≡ 1 (mod m), every balanced edge-coloring of K_n with m colors contains a rainbow copy of G?\n\nSpecific challenge: In any balanced 6-coloring of K_{6n+1}, must there exist a rainbow C_6 or rainbow K_4?\n\nKnown: K_4 does NOT have this property (Clemen-Wagner 2023). Infinitely many complete graphs fail (Axenovich-Clemen 2024).",
    "proofStrategy": "This problem remains OPEN. Our formalization defines edge colorings, balanced colorings, rainbow subgraphs, and the rainbow property for graphs. We axiomatize known results: Erdős-Tuza bounds for C_4, Clemen-Wagner's disproof for K_4, and Axenovich-Clemen's result showing infinitely many K_m fail. We also state their conjecture that all K_m fail for m ≥ 4.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A balanced coloring exists only when n ≡ 1 (mod m), ensuring equal color distribution",
      "K_4 lacks the rainbow property: there exist balanced 6-colorings of K_n without rainbow K_4",

The failure of K_4 suggests that even highly symmetric graphs may lack the rainbow property, potentially due to algebraic constructions avoiding rainbow complete graphs.",
