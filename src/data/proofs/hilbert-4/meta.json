  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Hilbert's 4th Problem (1900) asked for the characterization of geometries where straight lines remain the shortest distance between two points, while weakening congruence axioms and omitting the parallel postulate.\n\nHamel made the first progress in 1903, showing that in 2D, only Minkowski geometries satisfy these conditions. Busemann provided the complete solution in 1955.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question:** Find all geometries whose axioms are closest to Euclidean geometry if the ordering and incidence axioms are retained, the congruence axioms weakened, and the parallel postulate omitted.\n\nMore specifically: Characterize all metrics where straight lines are the shortest paths between points.",
    "proofStrategy": "The solution involves three main classes of metrics:\n\n1. **Minkowski Geometries**: Normed vector spaces with convex unit ball\n2. **Hilbert Geometries**: Metrics on convex domains defined by cross-ratio\n3. **Funk-type Metrics**: Asymmetric projective metrics\n\nBusemann proved these exhaust all possibilities.",
