  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks whether the sum-of-divisors function σ has enough flexibility to produce sequences with equal values at any prescribed ratio limit. Erdős posed this in 1974, noting the analogous result for Euler's totient φ(n) is 'easy to prove.' The σ case proved more challenging, requiring sophisticated analysis of the fibers of σ. Paul Pollack resolved it affirmatively in 2015, demonstrating that for any α ≥ 1, one can construct sequences n_k, m_k with σ(n_k) = σ(m_k) and n_k/m_k → α. The proof leverages the multiplicativity of σ and the rich structure of prime factorizations.",
    "problemStatement": "Let α ≥ 1. Is there a sequence of integers n_k, m_k such that n_k/m_k → α and σ(n_k) = σ(m_k) for all k ≥ 1, where σ is the sum of divisors function?",
    "proofStrategy": "Pollack's approach uses careful construction via multiplicativity of σ and properties of prime factorizations. The key observation is that σ-pairs (numbers with equal σ values) are abundant enough to approximate any ratio. Examples like σ(14) = σ(15) = 24 show that consecutive integers can have equal σ values, providing flexibility for ratio approximation.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "σ-pairs are surprisingly common (σ(14) = σ(15), σ(206) = σ(210))",
      "The multiplicativity σ(mn) = σ(m)σ(n) for coprime m,n enables constructions",
      "Fibers σ⁻¹(m) can be arbitrarily large",
      "The analogous φ result is 'easy' due to even more abundant φ-pairs",
      "Many even numbers are achieved as σ values"
