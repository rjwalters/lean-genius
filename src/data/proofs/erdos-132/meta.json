    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points. Must there be two distances which occur at least once but between at most $n$ pairs of points? Must the number of such distances $\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Pach. Hopf and Pannowitz \\cite{HoPa34} proved that the largest distance between points of $A$ can occur at most $n$ times, but it is unknown whether a second such distance must occur.\n\nIt may be true that there are at least $n^{1-o(1)}$ many such distances. In \\cite{Er97e} Erd\\H{o}s offers \\$100 for 'any nontrivial result'.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er84c} believed that for $n\\geq 5$ there must always exist at least two such distances. This is false for $n=4$, as witnessed by two equilateral triangles of the same side-length glued together. Erd\\H{o}s and Fishburn \\cite{ErFi95} proved this is true for $n=5$ and $n=6$.\n\nClemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu \\cite{CDL25} have proved that there always at least two such distances if $A$ is in convex position (that is, no point lies inside the convex hull of the others). They also prove it is true if the set $A$ is 'not too convex', in a specific technical sense.\n\nSee also [223], [756], and [957].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CDL25] F. Clemen, A. Dumitrescu, and D.
