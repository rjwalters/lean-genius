    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Gallai, and Tuza (1996) posed this conjecture, noting it 'is probably quite difficult.' Norin and Sun (2016) proved the stronger result using bipartite removal. The problem connects triangle edge covers to classical extremal graph theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph on n vertices. Define α₁(G) = maximum number of edges containing at most one edge from each triangle, and τ₁(G) = minimum number of edges hitting every triangle. Is α₁(G) + τ₁(G) ≤ n²/4?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize triangle edge covers (τ₁), triangle-sparse sets (α₁), bipartite removal (τ_B), the key inequality τ₁ ≤ τ_B, Norin-Sun's main result, equality cases (complete graphs, complete bipartite, K_{m,m}+vertex), and connection to Mantel's theorem.",

      "Since τ₁(G) ≤ τ_B(G), the original conjecture follows",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #621 on triangle edge covers. Norin-Sun (2016) proved α₁(G) + τ_B(G) ≤ n²/4, which implies the original conjecture since τ₁(G) ≤ τ_B(G). Three families of graphs achieve equality.",
    "implications": "The result reveals deep connections between triangle covering, bipartite removal, and classical extremal graph theory. The bound n²/4 appears in both this problem and Mantel's theorem, suggesting a unified structure.",
