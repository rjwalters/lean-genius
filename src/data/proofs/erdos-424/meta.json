  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in 1977. The sequence a_i · a_j − 1 starting from {2,3} grows in a complex way. It appears as E31 in Guy's book and Problem 63 on Green's open problems list.",
    "problemStatement": "Start with a₁ = 2, a₂ = 3. Iteratively append all a_i · a_j − 1 (i ≠ j). Does the set of integers that eventually appear have positive density?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the generation process, define the full generated set, and state the positive-density conjecture. The mod 3 obstruction provides an upper density bound of 2/3.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The sequence begins 2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 17, 26, ... (OEIS A005244)",
      "No element is ≡ 1 (mod 3), by induction on the generation",
      "Maximum possible density is 2/3",
      "The set is closed under (x,y) ↦ xy − 1 for distinct elements",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #424 asks whether the set generated from {2,3} by the operation a_i · a_j − 1 has positive density. The mod 3 obstruction caps density at 2/3, and the question of positive density remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would illuminate the density properties of multiplicatively generated integer sequences.",

      "Does generatedSet have positive density?",
