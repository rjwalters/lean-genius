  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Gyárfás originally conjectured the answer is NO: for every r, there exists a graph with min degree r containing no 2^k-cycle. Liu-Montgomery (2020) disproved this conjecture by showing that for sufficiently large minimum degree, such cycles must exist. The case of minimum degree exactly 3 remains OPEN with a $1000 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every finite graph with minimum degree at least 3 contain a cycle of length 2^k for some k ≥ 2?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cycle containment, minimum degree, and powers of two. The main conjecture and the (disproved) Erdős-Gyárfás conjecture are stated. Liu-Montgomery's threshold result is axiomatized. The infinite counterexample (3-regular tree) is also formalized. Related results include Dirac's theorem and Bondy's pancyclicity theorem.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #64, an OPEN problem with a $1000 prize asking whether every finite graph with minimum degree ≥ 3 contains a cycle of length 2^k for some k ≥ 2. Liu-Montgomery (2020) proved this for large minimum degree, disproving the Erdős-Gyárfás conjecture. The case of minimum degree exactly 3 remains open.",
    "implications": "This problem connects minimum degree conditions to specific cycle lengths. A positive answer would establish that power-of-two lengths are 'unavoidable' for sparse graphs. A counterexample would need to be highly structured (not random-like).",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does the conjecture hold for minimum degree exactly 3?",
      "What is the exact threshold D from Liu-Montgomery?",
      "Are there 'almost counterexamples' with few power-of-two cycles?",
      "Can the result be extended to other sparse sequences?"
