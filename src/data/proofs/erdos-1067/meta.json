We say a graph is infinitely connected if any two vertices are connected by infinitely many pairwise disjoint paths.\n\nKomj\\'{a}th \\cite{Ko13} proved that it is consistent that the answer is no. This was improved by Soukup \\cite{So15}, who constructed a counterexample using no extra set-theoretical assumptions. A simpler elementary example was given by Bowler and Pitz \\cite{BoPi24}.\n\nThomassen \\cite{Th17} constructed a counterexample to the version which asks for infinite edge-connectivity (that is, to disconnect the graph requires deleting infinitely many edges).\n\nIn \\cite{ErHa66} Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal asked the same question under the additional assumption that the graph has $\\aleph_1$ many vertices. Komj\\'{a}th \\cite{Ko13} proved that the answer is independent of ZFC.\n\nSee also [1068].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BoPi24] N. Bowler and M.
