    "historicalContext": "Good (1974) and Bicknell-Hoggatt (1976) proved Σ 1/F_{2^n} is irrational. André-Jeannin (1989) proved the full sum Σ 1/F_n is irrational using transcendence theory. The general conjecture for arbitrary ratio bound c > 1 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let F_n be the Fibonacci sequence (F₁ = F₂ = 1, F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}). If n₁ < n₂ < ... is an infinite sequence with n_{k+1}/n_k ≥ c > 1, must Σ 1/F_{n_k} be irrational? Erdős also asked if n_k/k → ∞ might suffice.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Fibonacci growth, the golden ratio, and series convergence. Verified theorems include Fibonacci values and the golden ratio bound. The solved cases (2^n indices and full sum) are recorded as axioms. The main conjecture and weaker variant are formalized as open problems.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #267 is PARTIALLY SOLVED. The specific cases Σ 1/F_{2^n} and Σ 1/F_n are proved irrational, but the general conjecture for arbitrary ratio bound c > 1 remains open. Paradoxically, the strongest result (c=1, all terms) is proved while intermediate cases are open.",
    "implications": "The results connect Fibonacci numbers to transcendence theory and continued fractions. Understanding which subsequences give irrational sums reveals deep structure in the Fibonacci sequence.",
