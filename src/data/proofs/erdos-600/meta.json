  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1987, building on the influential work of Ruzsa and Szemerédi (1978) on triple systems and the triangle removal lemma. The problem asks about the fine structure of how the edge threshold changes as we require more triangles per edge.",
    "problemStatement": "Let e(n,r) be the minimal number of edges such that every graph on n vertices with at least e(n,r) edges, where each edge is in at least one triangle, must have some edge contained in at least r triangles. For r ≥ 2: (1) Does e(n,r+1) - e(n,r) → ∞ as n → ∞? (2) Does e(n,r+1)/e(n,r) → 1 as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines graphs, triangles, and edge-triangle containment, then constructs the e(n,r) threshold function. The known Ruzsa-Szemerédi result e(n,r) = o(n²) is axiomatized, and both open questions are formalized as precise mathematical statements about limits.",

      "The triangle removal lemma underlies the subquadratic bound",
      "Question 1 asks if absolute differences grow unboundedly",
      "Question 2 asks if ratios converge to 1 (asymptotic equivalence)",
      "If both are true, differences → ∞ but relative differences → 0"
