    "content": "A simple graph on n vertices is represented by its edge set, which is a subset of Fin n × Fin n. The structure enforces two key properties: symmetry (if (u,v) is an edge, so is (v,u)) and irreflexivity (no self-loops). This is a standard representation for undirected graphs in formal mathematics.",
