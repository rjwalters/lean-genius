    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #131 asks for the maximum size F(N) of a 'non-dividing' subset of {1,...,N}. A set is non-dividing if no element divides the sum of any distinct subset of other elements. Erdős originally conjectured F(N) < (log N)^O(1), but Straus proved it grows much faster: exp(c√(log N)). The original specific question 'Is F(N) > N^{1/2-o(1)}?' was recently answered NO by Pham-Zakharov (2024), who showed F(N) ≤ N^{1/4+o(1)} via the connection to non-averaging sets.",
    "problemStatement": "Let F(N) be the maximal size of A ⊆ {1, ..., N} such that no a ∈ A divides the sum of any distinct elements of A \\ {a}. Estimate F(N).\n\nOriginal question: Is F(N) > N^{1/2-o(1)}?\nAnswer: NO (Pham-Zakharov 2024, via F(N) ≤ N^{1/4+o(1)})\n\nRemaining open: What is the exact growth rate of F(N)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The exact growth remains OPEN. Our formalization defines non-dividing sets and proves they are non-averaging (connecting to Problem #186). We axiomatize: ELRSS upper bound 3√N+1, Pham-Zakharov N^{1/4+o(1)} bound, Csaba's N^{1/5} lower bound, and Straus's exp(c√(log N)) lower bound. The key insight is that non-dividing ⟹ non-averaging allows transferring results.",
