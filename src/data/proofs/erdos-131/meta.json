Estimate $F(N)$. In particular, is it true that\\[F(N) > N^{1/2-o(1)}?\\]\n\n\n\nThis was studied by Erd\\H{o}s, Lev, Rauzy, S\\'{a}ndor, and S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy \\cite{ELRSS99}, where they call such a property 'non-dividing', and prove the explicit bound\\[F(N)<3N^{1/2}+1.\\]In \\cite{Er97b} Erd\\H{o}s credits Csaba with a construction that proves $F(N) \\gg N^{1/5}$. Such a construction was also given in \\cite{ELRSS99}, where it is linked to the problem of non-averaging sets (see [186]).\n\nIndeed, every such set is non-averaging, and hence the result of Pham and Zakharov \\cite{PhZa24} implies\\[F(N) \\leq N^{1/4+o(1)}.\\]This shows the answer to the original question is no, but the general question of the correct growth of $F(N)$ remains open.\n\nIn \\cite{Er75b} Erd\\H{o}s writes that he originally thought $F(N) <(\\log N)^{O(1)}$, but that Straus proved that\\[F(N) > \\exp((\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{\\log 2}}+o(1))\\sqrt{\\log N}).\\]See also [13].\n\nThis is discussed in problem C16 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ELRSS99] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Lev, V. and Rauzy, G. and S\\'andor, C. and\nS\\'ark\\\"ozy, A., Greedy algorithm, arithmetic progressions, subset sums and\ndivisibility.
