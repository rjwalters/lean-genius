Estimate the maximum of\\[\\frac{1}{\\log N}\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}.\\]\n\n\n\nAlexander \\cite{Al66} and Erd\\H{o}s, S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zi, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{ESS68} proved that this maximum is $o(1)$ (as $N\\to \\infty$). This condition on $A$ is a weaker form of the usual primitive condition. If $A$ is primitive then Behrend \\cite{Be35} proved\\[\\frac{1}{\\log N}\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}\\ll \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}}.\\]An example of such a set $A$ is the set of all integers in $[N^{1/2},N]$ divisible by some prime $>N^{1/2}$.\n\nSee also [143].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al66] Alexander, Ralph, Density and multiplicative structure of sets of integers.
