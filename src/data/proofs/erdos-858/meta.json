  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns sets avoiding certain multiplicative relations. The condition is a weakening of the primitive set condition (where no element divides another). Alexander (1966) and independently Erdős-Sárközi-Szemerédi (1968) proved the weighted reciprocal sum vanishes asymptotically. For the stronger primitive condition, Behrend (1935) showed a faster rate of decay.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊆ {1, ..., N} be such that there is no solution to at = b with a, b ∈ A and the smallest prime factor of t is > a. Estimate the maximum of (1/log N) · Σ_{n ∈ A} 1/n.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the multiplicative condition (no at=b with spf(t) > a), primitive sets, and the weighted reciprocal sum. Alexander's and Erdős-Sárközi-Szemerédi's results are stated as axioms showing the maximum is o(1). Behrend's bound for primitive sets is included for comparison.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The condition spf(t) > a is weaker than primitivity (a ∤ b)",
      "Primitive sets satisfy this condition automatically",
      "The weighted sum (1/log N) Σ 1/n = o(1) for sets satisfying the condition",
      "For primitive sets, Behrend showed the stronger bound O(1/√(log log N))",
      "Example: integers in [√N, N] divisible by primes > √N satisfy the condition"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #858 is SOLVED. For A ⊆ {1,...,N} satisfying the multiplicative condition (no at=b with spf(t) > a), the maximum of (1/log N) Σ_{n∈A} 1/n is o(1). This was proved independently by Alexander (1966) and Erdős-Sárközi-Szemerédi (1968).",
