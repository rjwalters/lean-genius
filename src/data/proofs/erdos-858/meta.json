    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #858: Primitive-Like Sets**\n\nThis problem studies a weaker form of primitive sets and their logarithmic density.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Behrend (1935): For primitive sets, (1/log N) * sum(1/n) << 1/sqrt(log log N)\n- Alexander (1966): Proved the primitive-like condition also gives o(1) density\n- Erdos-Sarkozy-Szemeredi (1968): Independent proof of the same result\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- A **primitive set** has no element dividing another (very restrictive)\n- The **primitive-like condition** allows a | b if t = b/a has smallest prime factor <= a\n- Both conditions limit how dense a set can be in logarithmic measure\n\n**Example:** The set of integers in [sqrt(N), N] divisible by some prime > sqrt(N) satisfies the primitive-like condition.",

    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Smallest Prime Factor:** Define smallestPrimeFactor using Nat.minFac, with properties showing it divides n and is minimal among prime divisors.\n\n2. **Primitive-Like Condition:** Define IsPrimitiveLike requiring that if a | b in A with a < b, then smallestPrimeFactor(b/a) <= a.\n\n3. **Primitive Sets:** Define IsPrimitive (no a | b for distinct elements) and prove primitive implies primitive-like.\n\n4. **Logarithmic Density:** Define logSum = sum(1/n) and normalizedLogDensity = logSum / log(N).\n\n5. **Main Results:** Axiomatize Alexander's theorem and ESS theorem showing the normalized density is o(1).\n\n6. **Example Set:** Define the example set [sqrt(N), N] with large prime factors.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdos Problem #858 asks about the logarithmic density of sets satisfying a primitive-like condition. Alexander (1966) and Erdos-Sarkozy-Szemeredi (1968) proved that the maximum of (1/log N) * sum(1/n) over such sets is o(1). This is weaker than Behrend's O(1/sqrt(log log N)) bound for primitive sets, but the primitive-like condition is also weaker.",
    "implications": "**Number-Theoretic Connections**\n\n1. **Primitive Sets Theory:** Extends classical results on sets where no element divides another\n\n2. **Logarithmic Density:** Shows how divisibility constraints affect sum(1/n) type sums\n\n3. **Prime Factor Conditions:** The smallest prime factor plays a key role in density bounds\n\n4. **Asymptotic Analysis:** The o(1) result is weaker than explicit rates but still significant\n\n5. **Example Constructions:** The [sqrt(N), N] example shows the condition is non-trivial",
