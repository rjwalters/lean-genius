  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós studied the gap distribution in sumsets of Sidon sets in their 1994 paper 'On Sum Sets of Sidon Sets, I'. A Sidon (B₂) set has all pairwise sums distinct, so |A+A| = n(n+1)/2. When A ⊆ {1,...,N} with |A| ~ √N, the sumset lies in {2,...,2N} with ~n²/2 elements, giving average gap ~4. The conjecture asks whether the variance of these gaps grows without bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be a finite Sidon set and A+A = {s₁ < ... < sₜ}. Is it true that (1/t) · Σᵢ (s_{i+1} - sᵢ)² → ∞ as |A| → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define Sidon sets, the sumset A+A, sort it, compute the sum of squared consecutive gaps, and define the mean squared gap. The conjecture ErdosProblem153 states this diverges. Known bounds on sumset size and range are axiomatized, along with the Erdős–Sárközy–Sós lower bound. The infinite Sidon set variant is also stated.",
