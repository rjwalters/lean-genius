  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Hilbert asked in 1900 whether every non-negative polynomial is a sum of squares. Artin resolved this in 1927: yes, but of rational functions, not polynomials!",
    "problemStatement": "**Question:** If f is a polynomial with f(x) >= 0 for all x, is f a sum of squares?\n\n**Answer (Artin):** Yes, but as a sum of squares of rational functions. Motzkin's polynomial shows polynomials don't suffice.",
    "proofStrategy": "1. State Artin's theorem using real closed field theory\n2. Show Motzkin's polynomial x^4*y^2 + x^2*y^4 - 3*x^2*y^2 + 1 is non-negative but not SOS of polynomials\n3. Explain the degree obstruction",
