Kim's original proof gave $c\\geq 1/162$. The bound $c\\geq 1/4$ was proved independently by Bohman and Keevash \\cite{BoKe21} and Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris \\cite{PGM20}. The latter collection of authors conjecture that this lower bound is the true order of magnitude.\n\nThis was, however, improved by Campos, Jenssen, Michelen, and Sahasrabudhe \\cite{CJMS25} to $c\\geq 1/3$, and further by Hefty, Horn, King, and Pfender \\cite{HHKP25} to $c\\geq 1/2$. Both of these papers conjecture that $c=1/2$ is the correct asymptotic.\n\nSee also [544], and [986] for the general case. See [1013] for a related function.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AKS80] Ajtai, Mikl\\'{o}s and Koml\\'{o}s, J\\'{a}nos and Szemer\\'{e}di, Endre, A note on Ramsey numbers. J. Combin. Theory Ser.
