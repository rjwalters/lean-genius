  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Hadwiger–Nelson problem was posed independently by Hadwiger (1945) and Nelson (1950). For over 50 years the bounds 4 ≤ χ ≤ 7 stood. In 2018, Aubrey de Grey made the first improvement by showing χ ≥ 5.",
    "problemStatement": "What is the chromatic number of the plane? That is, what is the minimum number of colors needed to color ℝ² so that no two points at unit distance share a color?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the unit-distance graph, define the chromatic number of the plane, and state the known bounds: 5 ≤ χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7. The Erdős–de Bruijn theorem reduces the problem to finite graphs.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "χ(ℝ²) ∈ {5, 6, 7} — only three possibilities remain",
      "de Grey (2018) improved the lower bound from 4 to 5 after 60+ years",
      "Isbell's hexagonal tiling gives the 7-color upper bound",
      "Erdős–de Bruijn: the infinite problem reduces to finite subgraphs",
      "Fractional chromatic number is between 4 and 4.36"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #508 (the Hadwiger–Nelson problem) asks for the chromatic number of the plane. After de Grey's 2018 breakthrough, it is known that 5 ≤ χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7.",
    "implications": "Determining χ(ℝ²) would resolve one of the most famous problems in combinatorial geometry, with connections to Ramsey theory and distance geometry.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is χ(ℝ²) = 5, 6, or 7?",
