  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem comes from the Erdős-Graham collaboration on combinatorial number theory. The question asks whether one can do better than the trivial sequence {1, 2, ..., n} in terms of distinct consecutive subsums. The trivial sequence fails because many consecutive sums coincide (e.g., arithmetic progressions have highly structured sums).",
    "problemStatement": "Is there c > 0 such that for all large n, there exist integers a₁ < a₂ < ... < aₖ ≤ n with at least cn² distinct consecutive sums Σ_{u≤i≤v} aᵢ?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines consecutive subsums and the counting function. The trivial sequence failure is established, and Beker's theorem (2023) proving the affirmative answer is axiomatized. Konieczny's related result on permutations is also included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The trivial sequence {1,...,n} achieves only O(n) distinct consecutive sums",
      "Careful spacing between elements prevents sum collisions",
      "Permutations can also achieve cn² distinct sums (Konieczny 2015)",
      "The problem is closely related to sumset problems in additive combinatorics",
