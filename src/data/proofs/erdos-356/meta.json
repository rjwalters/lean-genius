Erd\\H{o}s and Graham also ask what happens if we drop the monotonicity restriction and just ask that the $a_i$ are distinct. They speculated that perhaps some permutation of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ has at least $cn^2$ such distinct sums - this is true, as proved by Konieczny \\cite{Ko15} (see [34]).\n\nThe original problem was solved (in the affirmative) by Beker \\cite{Be23b}.\n\nThey also ask how many consecutive integers $>n$ can be represented as such a sum? Is it true that, for any $c>0$ at least $cn$ such integers are possible (for sufficiently large $n$)?\n\nSee also [34], [357], and [358].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Be23b] Beker, A., On a problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Graham about consecutive sums in strictly increasing sequences. arXiv:2311.10087 (2023).\n\n[Ko15] Konieczny, J., On consecutive sums in permutations. arXiv:1504.07156 (2015).\n\n\nBack to the problem",
