  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about integer distance sets in 'general position' - meaning no three points collinear and no four points concyclic. This rules out trivial infinite examples like points on a line or circle.\n\nAnning and Erdős (1945) proved that any set in the plane with no three collinear and all pairwise distances integers must be finite. This fundamental result shows such sets cannot be arbitrarily large.\n\nHarborth showed that n=5 is achievable. Kreisel and Kurz (2008) constructed a 7-point example, which remains the best known. Whether n=8 or larger is possible is open.\n\nRecent work by Greenfeld, Iliopoulou, and Peluse (2024) proved that such sets in [-N,N]² have size O((log N)^C), showing they must be extremely sparse.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question**: For all $n \\geq 4$, do there exist $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, no three collinear and no four concyclic, such that all pairwise distances are integers?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Known constructions**:\n- $n = 5$: Harborth\n- $n = 7$: Kreisel-Kurz (2008) - best known\n\n**Key constraint**: Anning-Erdős (1945) proved such sets must be finite.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem and known results:\n\n1. **Definitions**: Point, collinearity, concyclicity, integer distances\n2. **IsIntegerDistanceSetGP**: Combined predicate for all conditions\n3. **anning_erdos_finite**: Axiom for finiteness\n4. **harborth_five, kreisel_kurz_seven**: Construction axioms\n5. **exists_four, exists_five, exists_six, exists_seven**: Theorems from axioms\n6. **gip_sparsity_bound**: Upper bound axiom\n\nThe theorems for n=4,5,6 follow by taking subsets of the n=7 construction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**General position**: No three collinear AND no four concyclic - rules out infinite examples.",
      "**Anning-Erdős**: Even without the concyclic condition, integer distance sets with no three collinear are finite.",
      "**Best known**: n=7 by Kreisel-Kurz (2008). Whether n=8 works is unknown.",
      "**Sparsity**: In [-N,N]², such sets have size at most O((log N)^C) - very sparse!",
      "**Subset trick**: n=4,5,6 follow from n=7 since subsets inherit the properties."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #213 on integer distance sets in general position. The Lean proof establishes all definitions, axiomatizes key results (Anning-Erdős finiteness, Harborth n=5, Kreisel-Kurz n=7, GIP sparsity), and proves existence for n=4,5,6,7 from the axioms.",
    "implications": "The gap between the best construction (n=7) and the lack of proof that larger sets don't exist represents a fundamental open question in combinatorial geometry. The sparsity bounds suggest such sets must be rare, but don't preclude larger examples.",
