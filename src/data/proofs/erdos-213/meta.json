Are there $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, no three on a line and no four on a circle, such that all pairwise distances are integers?\n\n\n\nAnning and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{AnEr45} proved there cannot exist an infinite such set. Harborth constructed such a set when $n=5$. The best construction to date, due to Kreisel and Kurz \\cite{KK08}, has $n=7$.\n\nAscher, Braune, and Turchet \\cite{ABT20} have shown that there is a uniform upper bound on the size of such a set, conditional on the Bombieri-Lang conjecture. Greenfeld, Iliopoulou, and Peluse \\cite{GIP24} have shown (unconditionally) that any such set must be very sparse, in that if $S\\subseteq [-N,N]^2$ has no three on a line and no four on a circle, and all pairwise distances integers, then\\[\\lvert S\\rvert \\ll (\\log N)^{O(1)}.\\]See also [130].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ABT20] Ascher, K. and Braune, L. and Turchet, A., The Erd\\H{o}s-Ulam problem, Lang's conjecture, and uniformity. arXiv:1901.02616 (2020).\n\n[AnEr45] Anning, Norman H. and Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Integral distances.
