  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #11 asks whether every odd integer greater than 1 can be written as the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2. A number is **squarefree** if no prime square divides it (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, ...).\n\nThis seemingly simple question has profound connections to one of the deepest mysteries in number theory: **Wieferich primes**. These are primes p where 2^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p²). Only two are known: 1093 and 3511, despite searches up to 2^64.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős):** Every odd integer n > 1 can be written as n = s + 2^k where s is squarefree and k >= 0.\n\nExamples:\n- 3 = 1 + 2\n- 5 = 1 + 4\n- 7 = 5 + 2\n- 9 = 1 + 8\n\n**Status:** OPEN. Verified computationally up to 2^50 ≈ 10^15 by Hercher (2024).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `IsSquarefree n`: n has no prime square divisors\n2. `IsPowerOfTwo n`: n = 2^k for some k\n3. `IsSquarefreePlusPow2 n`: n = s + p for squarefree s and power of 2 p\n4. `Erdos11Conjecture`: the main statement\n5. `IsWieferichPrime p`: 2^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p²)\n\nWe prove small examples (3, 5, 7, 9) and axiomatize the computational verification and the Granville-Soundararajan connection.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Wieferich connection:** Granville-Soundararajan (1998) proved that if the conjecture holds, infinitely many primes are non-Wieferich.",
      "**Only two Wieferich primes known:** 1093 and 3511. No others found up to 2^64 despite massive computation.",
      "**Computational verification:** Hercher (2024) verified all odd n up to 2^50 ≈ 1.12 × 10^15.",
      "**Almost all n work:** Erdős proved the conjecture holds for density-1 of odd integers.",
      "**Weaker version:** Erdős also asked about n not divisible by 4 (allows some even numbers)."
