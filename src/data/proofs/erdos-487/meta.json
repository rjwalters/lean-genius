Must there exist distinct $a,b,c\\in A$ such that $[a,b]=c$ (where $[a,b]$ is the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$)?\n\n\n\nDavenport and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{DaEr37} showed that there must exist an infinite sequence $a_1<a_2\\cdots$ in $A$ such that $a_i\\mid a_j$ for all $i\\leq j$.\n\nThis is true, a consequence of the positive solution to [447] by Kleitman \\cite{Kl71}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DaEr37] No reference found.\n\n\n[Kl71] Kleitman, Daniel, Collections of subsets containing no two sets and their union.
