A number $n$ is $r$-powerful if for every prime $p$ which divides $n$ we have $p^r\\mid n$. Is every large integer the sum of at most $r+1$ many $r$-powerful numbers?\n\n\n\nGiven in the 1986 Oberwolfach problem book as a problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Ivi\\'{c}.\n\nThis is true when $r=2$, as proved by Heath-Brown \\cite{He88} (see [941]).\n\nSee [940] for the problem of which integers are the sum of at most $r$ many $r$-powerful numbers.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[He88] Heath-Brown, D. R., Ternary quadratic forms and sums of three square-full numbers. (1988), 137--163.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
