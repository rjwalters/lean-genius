    "historicalContext": "**Ruzsa's Conjecture**\n\nThis problem is attributed by Erdős to Imre Z. Ruzsa, a Hungarian mathematician known for work in additive combinatorics and number theory.\n\n**The Question:** Given ε > 0, is there a constant C_ε such that for all sufficiently large n, the number of divisors of n lying in the narrow interval (√n, √n + n^{1/2-ε}) is at most C_ε?\n\n**Why It's Hard:** The interval shrinks relative to √n as n grows (since n^{1/2-ε} / √n = n^{-ε} → 0). Can divisors 'pile up' in this shrinking window?\n\n**Known Result:** Erdős and Rosenfeld (1997) showed there are infinitely many n with four divisors in (√n, √n + n^{1/4}). This uses ε = 1/4, giving a wider interval.\n\n**Current Status:** OPEN. The problem is considered tractable by some researchers.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $\\varepsilon > 0$. Is it true that, for all large $n$, the number of divisors of $n$ in $(\\sqrt{n}, \\sqrt{n} + n^{1/2-\\varepsilon})$ is $O_\\varepsilon(1)$?\n\n**Interpretation:** As n grows, the interval (√n, √n + n^{1/2-ε}) becomes relatively narrower (width n^{-ε} times √n). The conjecture asks whether only boundedly many divisors can fit in this shrinking window.\n\n**Contrast with Erdős-Rosenfeld:** For ε = 1/4 (giving interval width n^{1/4}), infinitely many n have at least 4 divisors there. The conjecture asks about arbitrarily small ε.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Divisor Basics:**\n   - divisorsOf(n): the set n.divisors from Mathlib\n   - divisorCount(n): τ(n) = |divisors|\n\n2. **The Critical Interval:**\n   - criticalInterval: (√n, √n + n^{1/2-ε})\n   - intervalWidth: n^{1/2-ε}\n   - divisorsInInterval: filter divisors by range\n   - divisorsNearSqrt: count in critical interval\n\n3. **The Conjecture:**\n   - ruzsaConjecture: ∀ε > 0, ∃C_ε, ∀large n, count ≤ C_ε\n   - ruzsaConjectureAlt: equivalent density formulation\n\n4. **Known Results:**\n   - Erdős-Rosenfeld: infinitely many n with 4 divisors in (√n, √n + n^{1/4})\n   - Trivial bound: count ≤ τ(n)\n\n5. **Related Concepts:**\n   - factorDifferenceSet: differences between divisors\n   - localDivisorDensity: count / interval width",
