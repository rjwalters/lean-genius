Perhaps the problem they intended was subtly different, and the problem in this form was the result of a typographical error, but I have no good guess what was intended here.\n\nSee also [369] and [928].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
