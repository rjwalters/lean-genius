    "historicalContext": "This problem from Erdős-Graham (1980) asks about consecutive integers whose largest prime factors are unusually small. Pomerance observed that relaxing the exponent from 1/2 to 1/√e - ε gives a positive density result. Steinerberger found an elegant construction: n = m² - 1 works when m is chosen appropriately.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many n such that gpf(n) < √n and gpf(n+1) < √(n+1), where gpf denotes the greatest prime factor?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize gpf with key properties and formalize the Steinerberger construction n = m² - 1 = (m-1)(m+1). For n = 63 = 8² - 1, we verify gpf(63) = 7 < √63 and gpf(64) = 2 < √64. The main theorem states infinitely many such n exist.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The key construction is n = m² - 1 = (m-1)(m+1)",
      "Then n + 1 = m², so gpf(n+1) = gpf(m)",
      "For powers of 2: gpf(2^(2k)) = 2 < 2^k = √(4^k)",
      "Example: n = 63, gpf(63) = 7 < √63 ≈ 7.94, gpf(64) = 2 < 8"
