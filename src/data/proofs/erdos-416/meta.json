  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the range of Euler's totient function φ. Not every positive integer is a totient value - for example, 3 is never φ(m) for any m, since φ(m) is even for m > 2. Pillai (1929) first showed totient values have density 0. Erdős refined this in 1935, and Maier-Pomerance (1988) and Ford (1998) obtained increasingly precise bounds, but an asymptotic formula remains elusive.",
    "problemStatement": "Let V(x) count the number of n ≤ x such that φ(m) = n has a solution (i.e., n is in the range of the totient function). (i) Does V(2x)/V(x) → 2 as x → ∞? (ii) Is there an asymptotic formula for V(x)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize V(x) as the cardinality of {n ∈ [1, ⌊x⌋] : ∃m, φ(m) = n}. The known bounds are stated as axioms: Pillai's V(x) = o(x), Erdős's V(x) = x(log x)^(-1+o(1)), Maier-Pomerance's formula with explicit constant C, and Ford's tight bounds. The main conjectures are expressed as Prop definitions since they remain open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Most integers are NOT totient values - the density is 0",
      "The only odd totient value is 1 (since φ(n) is even for n > 2)",
      "Ford (1998) determined V(x) up to constant factors, but this is not enough for an asymptotic formula",
      "The doubling ratio V(2x)/V(x) → 2 would follow from a simple asymptotic like V(x) ~ cx/log x"
