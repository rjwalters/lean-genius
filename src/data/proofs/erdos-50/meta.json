    "historicalContext": "Schoenberg proved that the distribution of φ(n)/n has a well-defined density function f(c). Erdős proved f is purely singular — continuous but with derivative zero almost everywhere. The $250 prize asks whether f'(x) > 0 for literally no x, not just almost no x.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the totient ratio set, Schoenberg's density function f, its properties (continuity, monotonicity, boundary values), Erdős's pure singularity result, and the main prize conjecture.",

      "φ(n)/n = ∏_{p | n} (1 − 1/p) depends only on the prime factorization",
      "Schoenberg's theorem: the density f(c) exists for all c ∈ [0,1]",
