    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #755: Equilateral Triangles in ℝ⁶**\n\nThis problem concerns the maximum number of equilateral triangles that can be formed by n points in 6-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Lenz (credited by Erdős): Original lower bound construction\n- Erdős-Purdy (1975): Published the orthogonal circles construction\n- Erdős (1994): Conjectured the upper bound T₆ᵘ(n) ≤ (1/27 + o(1))n³\n- Clemen-Dumitrescu-Liu (2025): Proved the conjecture in a stronger form\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nIn higher dimensions, point configurations can form many more equilateral triangles than in the plane. The dimension d = 6 is special: it's the first even dimension where cubic growth T_d(n) = Θ(n³) occurs.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nThe number of equilateral triangles of size 1 formed by any set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^6$ is at most $(\\frac{1}{27}+o(1))n^3$.\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nClemen-Dumitrescu-Liu (2025) proved:\n- $T_6(n) = (\\frac{1}{27}+o(1))n^3$ even for triangles of ANY size\n- Exact formulas for $T_d(n)$ for all even $d \\geq 6$\n\nThe lower bound $T_6^u(n) \\geq \\frac{n^3}{27} - O(n^2)$ is achieved by the Lenz construction.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #755 asked whether the maximum number of unit equilateral triangles formed by n points in ℝ⁶ is at most (1/27 + o(1))n³. The answer is YES, proved by Clemen-Dumitrescu-Liu in 2025. They showed the stronger result that T₆(n) = (1/27 + o(1))n³ even for triangles of any size, and found exact formulas for all even dimensions d ≥ 6.",
