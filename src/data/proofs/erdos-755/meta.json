The following construction (which \\cite{Er94b} attributes to Lenz, but appears in an earlier paper of Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy \\cite{ErPu75}) shows that\\[T_6^u(n)\\geq \\frac{n^3}{27}-O(n^2):\\]take three suitable orthogonal circles and take $n/3$ points on each of them which form $n/4$ inscribed squares.\n\nErd\\H{o}s believed this conjectured upper bound should hold even if we count equilateral triangles of any size.\n\nThis problem was solved in a strong form by Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu \\cite{CDL25b}, who in fact prove that if $T_6(n)$ is the maximal number of equilateral triangles of any size formed by $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^6$ then\\[T_6(n)=(\\tfrac{1}{27}+o(1))n^3.\\]Indeed, they give an exact formula for $T_d(n)$ for all even $d\\geq 6$ (and sufficiently large $n$).\n\nSee also [1086].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CDL25b] F.
