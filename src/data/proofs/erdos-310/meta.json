    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #310**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdos and Graham [ErGr80] and concerns the representation of rational numbers as sums of unit fractions (Egyptian fractions) drawn from dense subsets of integers.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdos and Graham: Original problem formulation\n- Croot: Early work on density conditions for unit fraction sums\n- Bloom (2021): Proved the density of integers representable as sums of distinct unit fractions summing to 1\n- Liu and Sawhney (2024): Resolved Erdos #310 by observing Bloom's result implies the conjecture\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe problem asks: given any subset A of {1,...,N} with |A| >= alpha*N (an alpha-dense set), can we always find S contained in A such that the sum of 1/n for n in S equals a/b where b is bounded by a constant depending only on alpha?\n\nThis touches on deep questions about the distribution of unit fractions and the structure of Egyptian fraction representations.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nLet $\\alpha > 0$ and $N \\geq 1$. Is it true that for any $A \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ with $|A| \\geq \\alpha N$, there exists $S \\subseteq A$ such that\n$$\\frac{a}{b} = \\sum_{n \\in S} \\frac{1}{n}$$\nwith $a \\leq b = O_\\alpha(1)$?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nLiu and Sawhney (2024) proved that for $(\\log N)^{-1/7+o(1)} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 1/2$, there exists $S \\subseteq A$ with $a/b = \\sum_{n \\in S} 1/n$ where $a \\leq b \\leq \\exp(O(1/\\alpha))$.\n\nThey also proved this bound is **sharp**: the dependence $b \\leq \\exp(O(1/\\alpha))$ cannot be improved.",
