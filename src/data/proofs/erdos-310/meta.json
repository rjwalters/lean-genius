  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Unit fractions (Egyptian fractions) have been studied since antiquity. The ancient Egyptians represented all fractions as sums of distinct unit fractions. Erdős asked a natural question about how 'simple' a rational can be represented using unit fractions from a dense subset of {1,...,N}. Here 'simple' means small denominator, bounded by a function of the density parameter α. This connects classical number theory to modern density combinatorics.",
    "problemStatement": "Let α > 0 and N ≥ 1. Is it true that for any A ⊆ {1,...,N} with |A| ≥ αN, there exists some S ⊆ A such that a/b = Σ_{n∈S} 1/n with a ≤ b = O_α(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "Liu and Sawhney (2024) observed that Bloom's density conjecture result (2021) implies a positive answer. They proved a more precise version: if (log N)^{-1/7+o(1)} ≤ α ≤ 1/2, then there exists S ⊆ A with a/b = Σ_{n∈S} 1/n where a ≤ b ≤ exp(O(1/α)). The bound exp(O(1/α)) is sharp.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Bloom's theorem guarantees subsets with unit fraction sums close to 1",
      "The bound b ≤ exp(O(1/α)) is exponential in 1/α and cannot be improved",
      "The result requires a minimum density threshold depending on log N",
      "Classical Egyptian fraction theory provides existence but not the bounded denominator property",
      "The problem connects density combinatorics to Diophantine approximation"
