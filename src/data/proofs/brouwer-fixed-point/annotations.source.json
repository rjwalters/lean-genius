    "content": "Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem states: every continuous function from a closed ball to itself has a fixed point. Despite its simple statement, this 1911 result required the development of algebraic topology to prove.\n\nThe intuition is beautiful: imagine stirring coffee in a circular cup. No matter how you stir (continuously), at least one point of coffee ends up exactly where it started. You cannot continuously move every point!\n\nThis formalization presents the conceptual structure. The full proof requires homology theory or degree theory, which we axiomatize to focus on the logical flow.",
