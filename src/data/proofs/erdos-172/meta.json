Hindman \\cite{Hi80} has proved this is false (with 7 colours) if we ask for an infinite $A$. In \\cite{Er77c} Erd\\H{o}s asks about the case for an infinite $A$ with just $2$ colours.\n\nMoreira \\cite{Mo17} has proved that in any finite colouring of $\\mathbb{N}$ there exist $x,y$ such that $\\{x,x+y,xy\\}$ are all the same colour.\n\nAlweiss \\cite{Al23} has proved that, in any finite colouring of $\\mathbb{Q}\\backslash \\{0\\}$ there exist arbitrarily large finite $A$ such that all sums and products of distinct elements in $A$ are the same colour. Bowen and Sabok \\cite{BoSa22} had proved this earlier for the first non-trivial case of $\\lvert A\\rvert=2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al23] R.
