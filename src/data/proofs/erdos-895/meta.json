  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem lies at the intersection of graph theory and additive combinatorics. Erdős and Hajnal posed it in 1995: if G is a triangle-free graph on the integers {1,...,n}, must there exist vertices a, b, a+b forming an independent set?\n\nThe question connects two distinct structures: the graph-theoretic constraint (triangle-free) and the arithmetic constraint (additive triple). Ben Barber settled it computationally using SAT solver verification, showing the answer is YES for n ≥ 18.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a triangle-free graph with vertex set {1, 2, ..., n}.\n\n**Question:** For sufficiently large n, must there exist vertices a, b, and a+b that form an independent set (no edges between them)?\n\n**Answer:** YES, for all n ≥ 18 (Barber)\n\nThe threshold n = 18 is sharp: there exists a triangle-free graph on {1,...,17} with no independent additive triple.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines `GraphOnInterval n` as SimpleGraph on Fin n\n2. Defines `IsTriangleFree` and `IsIndependentTriple`\n3. Defines `IsAdditiveTriple a b c` requiring a + b = c\n4. States `barber_theorem`: the result holds for n ≥ 18\n5. States `counterexample_17`: threshold is sharp\n6. Connects to Ramsey theory and Schur numbers\n7. States Hajnal's open generalization about Hindman sets",
