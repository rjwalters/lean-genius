Does it grow exponentially in $n$? Does\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\chi(G_n)^{1/n}\\]exist?\n\n\n\nA generalisation of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem (which addresses $n=2$). Frankl and Wilson \\cite{FrWi81} proved exponential growth:\\[\\chi(G_n) \\geq (1+o(1))1.2^n.\\]The trivial colouring (by tiling with cubes) gives\\[\\chi(G_n) \\leq (2+\\sqrt{n})^n.\\]Larman and Rogers \\cite{LaRo72} improved this to\\[\\chi(G_n) \\leq (3+o(1))^n,\\]and conjecture the truth may be $(2^{3/2}+o(1))^n$. Prosanov \\cite{Pr20} has given an alternative proof of this upper bound.\n\n\nSee also [508], [705], and [706].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FrWi81] Frankl, P. and Wilson, R.
