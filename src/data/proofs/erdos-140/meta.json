Prove that $r_3(N)\\ll N/(\\log N)^C$ for every $C>0$.\n\n\n\nProved by Kelley and Meka \\cite{KeMe23}. In \\cite{ErGr80} and \\cite{Er81} it is conjectured that this holds for every $k$-term arithmetic progression.\n\nSee also [3].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the combinatorial problems which I would most like to see solved.
