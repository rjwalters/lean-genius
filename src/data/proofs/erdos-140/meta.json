  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Roth (1953) proved r₃(N) = o(N), showing 3-AP-free sets have density 0. Decades of improvements followed: Bourgain (2008), Sanders (2011), Bloom-Sisask (2020). Kelley-Meka (2023) finally proved Erdős's conjecture that r₃(N) = O(N/(log N)^C) for all C > 0, resolving the $500 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Define r₃(N) = max{ |A| : A ⊆ {1,...,N}, A contains no non-trivial 3-term arithmetic progression }. Erdős conjectured that r₃(N) ≪ N/(log N)^C for every C > 0. Kelley and Meka (2023) proved this is true.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines 3-APs, the Roth number r₃(N), and proves it's achieved by some set. Historical bounds by Roth, Bourgain, Sanders, and Bloom-Sisask are recorded as axioms. The Kelley-Meka theorem is the main axiom resolving the problem. Corollaries about density decay and the k-term generalization are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "r₃(N) is well-defined and achieved (verified theorem)",
      "Historical progression: o(N) → O(N/√log log N) → O(N log log N⁵/log N) → O(N/(log N)^{1+c})",
      "Kelley-Meka (2023): r₃(N) = O(N/(log N)^C) for ALL C > 0",
      "Behrend lower bound: r₃(N) ≥ N/exp(c√log N) - gap remains open",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #140 is SOLVED (Kelley-Meka 2023). The maximum size of a 3-AP-free subset of {1,...,N} satisfies r₃(N) = O(N/(log N)^C) for all C > 0. This 70-year problem from Roth's 1953 breakthrough was resolved with a novel spectral approach.",
    "implications": "The Kelley-Meka theorem is a major breakthrough in additive combinatorics. It essentially determines the order of r₃(N) up to the gap with Behrend's lower bound. The techniques may apply to other Ramsey-type problems.",

      "What is the true order of r₃(N)? (Behrend gap)",

      "Is r₃(N) = Θ(N/exp(c√log N)) matching Behrend?",
