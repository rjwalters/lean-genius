  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects geometry to set theory in a surprising way. Erdős and Kakutani (1943) showed that for n=1, the decomposition exists if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis holds. Davies (1972) proved the n=2 case under CH, and Kunen (1987) proved it for all dimensions. Erdős and Hajnal showed that CH is necessary - without it, even finite partitions fail.",
    "problemStatement": "Can ℝⁿ be decomposed into countably many sets, such that within each set all pairwise distances are distinct?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the distinct distances property, countable decomposition, and the Continuum Hypothesis. Key results are axiomatized: Erdős-Kakutani equivalence (CH ↔ ℝ = countable union of ℚ-linearly independent sets), Davies' theorem for n=2, Kunen's theorem for all n, and the Erdős-Hajnal necessity result.",

      "The answer is YES assuming the Continuum Hypothesis",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1127 is SOLVED: ℝⁿ can be decomposed into countably many sets with distinct pairwise distances, assuming the Continuum Hypothesis. This was proved progressively: Erdős-Kakutani for n=1, Davies for n=2, Kunen for all n. The CH is necessary (Erdős-Hajnal).",
