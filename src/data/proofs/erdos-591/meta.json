  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Ordinal Ramsey theory extends the classical Ramsey theorem to infinite ordinals. The classical theorem guarantees monochromatic cliques in large finite graphs; ordinal Ramsey theory asks which infinite ordinals have analogous properties.\n\nSpecker (1957) made a surprising discovery: the Ramsey property α → (α, 3)² holds for α = ω² but FAILS for α = ω³, ω⁴, and all ω^n with n ≥ 3. This shows that larger ordinals can have worse Ramsey properties!\n\nChang later proved the property holds again for α = ω^ω, the first limit of limit ordinals. Schipperus (2010) and Darby independently proved the property also holds for α = ω^(ω²), confirming the pattern that limit ordinal exponents restore the Ramsey property.\n\nErdős offered $250 for its resolution, which was claimed when the problem was solved.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $\\alpha = \\omega^{\\omega^2}$. Is it true that in any red/blue coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_\\alpha$, there is either a red $K_\\alpha$ or a blue $K_3$?\n\nIn arrow notation: Does $\\omega^{\\omega^2} \\to (\\omega^{\\omega^2}, 3)^2$ hold?\n\n**Answer**: YES — Proved independently by Schipperus (2010) and Darby.\n\n**Complete Results**:\n- $\\omega^2 \\to (\\omega^2, 3)^2$ holds (Specker 1957)\n- $\\omega^n \\to (\\omega^n, 3)^2$ FAILS for $n \\geq 3$ (Specker 1957)\n- $\\omega^\\omega \\to (\\omega^\\omega, 3)^2$ holds (Chang)\n- $\\omega^{\\omega^2} \\to (\\omega^{\\omega^2}, 3)^2$ holds (Schipperus 2010, Darby)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this SOLVED problem by:\n\n1. **Axiomatizing the Ramsey property**: Define `OrdinalRamseyProperty α n` as the statement that every 2-coloring of pairs from α contains a monochromatic copy of order type α (color 1) or a monochromatic n-element set (color 2)\n\n2. **Stating known results as axioms**: Specker's positive result (ω²), Specker's negative results (ω^n for n≥3), Chang's result (ω^ω), and the Schipperus-Darby result (ω^(ω²))\n\n3. **Stating the main theorem**: `erdos_591` asserts that `OrdinalRamseyProperty (ω ^ (ω ^ 2)) 3` holds\n\n4. **Proving ordinal identities**: We verify basic facts like ω² = ω·ω using Mathlib's ordinal arithmetic",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Arrow notation**: α → (β, n)² means every 2-coloring of pairs from α contains a monochromatic order type β or a monochromatic n-set.",
      "**The surprising failure**: Larger ordinals don't always have better Ramsey properties. ω³ is 'worse' than ω² for this property!",
      "**Limit ordinal pattern confirmed**: The property holds for ω² (limit), fails for ω³, ω⁴, ... (successors of 2), then holds again for ω^ω and ω^(ω²) (limit exponents).",
      "**The answer is YES**: Schipperus (2010) and Darby independently proved ω^(ω²) → (ω^(ω²), 3)² holds.",
      "**Ordinal arithmetic**: ω^(ω²) = ω^(ω·ω) is enormously larger than ω^ω, which is already vastly beyond any ω^n."
