    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #960 from [Er84] asks about the threshold of ordinary lines needed to guarantee an all-ordinary r-subset in point configurations with no k collinear. Turán's theorem provides an upper bound. The problem connects to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem and ordinary lines in discrete geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "Let r, k >= 2. For n points with no k collinear, determine f_{r,k}(n): the minimum number of ordinary lines guaranteeing r points whose C(r,2) connecting lines are all ordinary. Is f_{r,k}(n) = o(n²)? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines PointConfig, NoKCollinear, IsOrdinaryLine, AllOrdinary, and the threshold function via sSup. The main conjecture is stated as little-o growth. The Turán upper bound is axiomatized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "An ordinary line passes through exactly 2 points of the configuration",
      "The threshold f_{r,k}(n) counts how many ordinary lines force an all-ordinary r-subset",
      "Turán's theorem gives f_{r,k}(n) <= (1-1/(r-1))n²/2 + 1",
      "The conjecture asks for subquadratic growth, or even linear growth",
      "Related to Sylvester-Gallai and ordinary lines problems"
