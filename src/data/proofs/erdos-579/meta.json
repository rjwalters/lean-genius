  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Hajnal, Sós, and Szemerédi studied dense graphs forbidding the octahedron (K₂,₂,₂). They proved that for edge density > 1/8, such graphs must have linear-size independent sets. The threshold 1/8 corresponds to the Turán density of K₂,₂,₂. The conjecture extends this to all positive densities.",
    "problemStatement": "For every δ > 0 and n sufficiently large, must every K₂,₂,₂-free graph on n vertices with at least δn² edges contain an independent set of size ≫_δ n?",
    "proofStrategy": "Defines K₂,₂,₂ containment, dense graphs, independent sets, and the independence number. States the EHSS result for δ > 1/8, the main conjecture, and the connection to Turán theory.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "K₂,₂,₂ is the octahedron graph — the Turán density is 1/8",
      "For δ > 1/8, the EHSS proof uses the structure of dense K₂,₂,₂-free graphs",
      "Below the Turán threshold, K₂,₂,₂-free graphs can have many edges and the conjecture becomes harder",
      "The linear independence number is a strong structural conclusion from a density assumption"
