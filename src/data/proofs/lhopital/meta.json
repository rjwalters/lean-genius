  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "L'Hopital's Rule has a fascinating origin story:\n\n- **Johann Bernoulli (1694)**: Actually discovered the rule and taught it to L'Hopital\n- **Guillaume de L'Hopital (1696)**: Published it in the first calculus textbook ever written\n- **The arrangement**: L'Hopital paid Bernoulli a salary in exchange for mathematical discoveries\n- **Priority dispute**: Bernoulli claimed credit only after L'Hopital's death in 1704\n\nDespite the controversy, the rule bears L'Hopital's name to this day.",
    "problemStatement": "**L'Hopital's Rule**:\n\nIf $f$ and $g$ are differentiable near $a$, and:\n1. Both $\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = 0$ and $\\lim_{x \\to a} g(x) = 0$ (the 0/0 form), or\n2. Both limits are $\\pm\\infty$ (the $\\infty/\\infty$ form)\n\nAnd if $\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$ exists, then:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = L$$",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof relies on the **Cauchy Mean Value Theorem**:\n\n1. **Cauchy MVT**: For differentiable $f, g$ on $(a, b)$:\n   $$\\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{g(b) - g(a)} = \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$\n   for some $c \\in (a, b)$.\n\n2. **Apply to our setting**: For $x$ near $a$:\n   $$\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{g(x) - g(a)} = \\frac{f(x) - 0}{g(x) - 0} = \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$$\n   equals $\\frac{f'(c_x)}{g'(c_x)}$ for some $c_x$ between $a$ and $x$.\n\n3. **Take the limit**: As $x \\to a$, we have $c_x \\to a$, so\n   $$\\lim_{x \\to a} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{c \\to a} \\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}$$",
