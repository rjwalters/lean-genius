  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1980-81, asking for bounds on W(3,k). Graham famously conjectured W(3,k) ≪ k², but this polynomial bound was spectacularly disproved by Green in 2022 who showed superpolynomial growth. The problem was fully resolved through a sequence of breakthroughs: Green's lower bound (2022), Hunter's improvement (2022), Schoen's subexponential upper bound (2021), and the Kelley-Meka/Bloom-Sisask advances (2023).",
    "problemStatement": "Let W(3,k) be the van der Waerden number - the minimum n such that any red/blue coloring of {1,...,n} contains either a red 3-term arithmetic progression or a blue k-term arithmetic progression. Give reasonable bounds for W(3,k). In particular: (1) give any non-trivial lower bounds for W(3,k), and (2) prove that W(3,k) < exp(k^c) for some constant c < 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization presents both the lower and upper bounds that resolve Erdős's challenges. For lower bounds, we state Green's superpolynomial bound and Hunter's improved bound with exponent 2. For upper bounds, we state Schoen's subexponential result and Bloom-Sisask's current best bound. The connection to 3-AP free sets via Kelley-Meka is also formalized.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #721 was SOLVED. Both challenges have been met: (1) Non-trivial lower bounds were established by Green (2022) and improved by Hunter (2022), showing W(3,k) ≥ exp(c(log k)²/log log k). (2) Subexponential upper bounds were first proved by Schoen (2021) and improved to W(3,k) ≤ exp(C(log k)^9) by Bloom-Sisask (2023). Graham's polynomial conjecture was disproved.",

      "Is the exact growth rate W(3,k) = exp((log k)^{2+o(1)})?",
