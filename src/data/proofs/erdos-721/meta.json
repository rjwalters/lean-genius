  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #721 asks for bounds on the off-diagonal van der Waerden number W(3,k) — the minimum n such that any 2-coloring of {1,...,n} contains either a red 3-term arithmetic progression or a blue k-term AP. Van der Waerden proved these numbers exist in 1927, but his original bounds were astronomically large (Ackermann-type). Erdős posed the challenge in 1980-81 to find reasonable bounds.\n\nGraham famously conjectured W(3,k) ≪ k², suggesting polynomial growth. This was spectacularly disproved by Green in 2022, who established the first superpolynomial lower bound: W(3,k) ≥ exp(c(log k)^{4/3}/(log log k)^{1/3}). Hunter improved this in the same year to exp(c(log k)²/log log k), raising the logarithmic exponent from 4/3 to 2.\n\nOn the upper bound side, Schoen (2021) first proved W(3,k) < exp(k^c) for c < 1, answering Erdős's second challenge. The Kelley-Meka breakthrough (2023) on sets without 3-term APs led to dramatic further improvements, culminating in Bloom-Sisask's bound W(3,k) ≤ exp(C(log k)^9). The exact growth rate, believed to be exp((log k)^{2+o(1)}), remains an open question.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet $W(3,k)$ be the minimum $n$ such that any red/blue coloring of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ contains either a red 3-term AP or a blue $k$-term AP.\n\n**Challenges:**\n1. Give any non-trivial lower bounds for $W(3,k)$\n2. Prove $W(3,k) < \\exp(k^c)$ for some $c < 1$\n\n**Resolution:** Both met. Current best bounds:\n$$\\exp\\left(c \\cdot \\frac{(\\log k)^2}{\\log\\log k}\\right) \\leq W(3,k) \\leq \\exp\\left(C \\cdot (\\log k)^9\\right)$$",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatizes W(3,k) as a function ℕ → ℕ with basic properties (existence, monotonicity, known values). Graham's polynomial conjecture is defined and stated to be false. The four key results are axiomatized: Green's and Hunter's lower bounds, Schoen's and Bloom-Sisask's upper bounds. The deep connection to 3-AP-free sets is formalized through Roth density bounds, Behrend's construction, and the Kelley-Meka density result. Three summary theorems combine the axioms into the main conclusions.",

(2) Subexponential upper bounds proved by Schoen (2021) and improved to W(3,k) ≤ exp(C(log k)^9) by Bloom-Sisask (2023). Graham's polynomial conjecture was disproved.",
