In particular, give any non-trivial lower bounds for $W(3,k)$ and prove that $W(3,k) < \\exp(k^c)$ for some constant $c<1$.\n\n\n\nWhile we do not have a full understanding of the growth of $W(3,k)$, both of the specific challenges of Erd\\H{o}s have been met.\nGreen \\cite{Gr22} established the superpolynomial lower bound\\[W(3,k) \\geq \\exp\\left( c\\frac{(\\log k)^{4/3}}{(\\log\\log k)\n^{1/3}}\\right)\\]for some constant $c>0$ (in particular disproving a conjecture of Graham that $W(3,k)\\ll k^2$). Hunter \\cite{Hu22} improved this to\\[W(3,k) \\geq \\exp\\left( c\\frac{(\\log k)^{2}}{\\log\\log k}\\right).\\]The first to show that $W(3,k) < \\exp(k^c)$ for some $c<1$ was Schoen \\cite{Sc21}. The best upper bound currently known is\\[W(3,k) \\ll \\exp\\left( O((\\log k)^9)\\right),\\]which follows from the best bounds known for sets without three-term arithmetic progressions (see \\cite{BlSi23} which improves slightly on the bounds due to Kelley and Meka \\cite{KeMe23}).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BlSi23] T.
