    "historicalContext": "Erdős (1990) asked for the precise asymptotic of F(n, α), the largest k such that some 2-colouring of K_n has every ≥k-vertex induced subgraph with > α fraction of edges of each colour. The probabilistic method gives c₁ log n < F < c₂ log n, but the exact constant c_α is unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove that F(n, α) ~ c_α log n for some constant c_α depending on α.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines edge 2-colourings, α-balanced subgraphs, and axiomatises F(n, α). The logarithmic bounds from the probabilistic method are stated. The main conjecture asserts convergence of F(n,α)/log n to a constant.",

      "The conjecture asks for the existence of the limit c_α = lim F(n,α)/log n",
