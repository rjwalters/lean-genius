    "historicalContext": "Bollobás, Erdős, and Szemerédi (1975) conjectured that in r-partite graphs with n vertices per part, minimum degree ≥ (r-3/2-o(1))n forces a K_r. They also showed this threshold is best possible. Haxell (2001) proved the conjecture using connections to list coloring. Haxell and Szabó (2006) determined the exact sharp threshold: (r-1)n - ⌈sn/(2s-1)⌉ where s = ⌊r/2⌋.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet G be an r-partite graph with n vertices in each part.\n\n**Question:** If G has minimum degree ≥ (r - 3/2 - o(1))n, must G contain K_r?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Haxell 2001)\n\n**Sharp Threshold:** (r-1)n - ⌈sn/(2s-1)⌉ where s = ⌊r/2⌋ (Haxell-Szabó 2006)\n\n**Best Possible:** r - 3/2 cannot be improved (BES 1975)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines r-partite graphs as structures with r parts of equal size. The BES conjecture is stated precisely, and Haxell's theorem is axiomatized as its proof. The Haxell-Szabó sharp threshold is formalized. Special cases (r=2,3,4) are computed, and the connection to independent transversals is explored.",
