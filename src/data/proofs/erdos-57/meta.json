  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Conjectured by Erdős and Hajnal in 1966, this problem connects chromatic number to the structure of odd cycles. Erdős later asked (1981) whether the odd cycle lengths must have positive upper density, and speculated (1995-96) it might be at least 1/2. Liu and Montgomery solved the original conjecture in 2020.",
    "problemStatement": "If G is a graph with infinite chromatic number and a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ are the lengths of the odd cycles of G, then ∑ 1/aᵢ = ∞.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization uses Mathlib's SimpleGraph and Walk.IsCycle. The main result is stated as an axiom, with a corollary proving infinite chromatic number implies infinitely many odd cycle lengths. Related open questions about density are also formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Infinite chromatic number forces divergent reciprocal sum of odd cycle lengths",
      "This implies infinitely many distinct odd cycle lengths",
      "Bipartite graphs have no odd cycles (χ ≤ 2)",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #57, solved by Liu and Montgomery in 2020. The result shows that graphs with infinite chromatic number must have 'many' odd cycles in a precise sense: the reciprocal sum of their lengths diverges.",
