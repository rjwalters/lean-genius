In \\cite{Er81} Erd\\H{o}s asks whether the $a_i$ must in fact have positive upper density, and in \\cite{Er95d} and \\cite{Er96} he speculates whether the upper density (or even upper logarithmic density) must be $\\geq 1/2$.\n\nThe lower density of the set can be $0$ since there are graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number and girth.\n\nSee also [65].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the combinatorial problems which I would most like to see solved.
