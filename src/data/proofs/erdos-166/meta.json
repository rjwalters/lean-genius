  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős offered $250 for proving that R(4,k) grows like k³ up to polylogarithmic factors. For 43 years (1980-2023), the gap between Spencer's lower bound (k log k)^{5/2} and the Ajtai-Komlós-Szemerédi upper bound k³/(log k)² remained open. This was finally resolved by Mattheus and Verstraete in 2023 using algebraic constructions from finite geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove that R(4,k) >> k³/(log k)^O(1), where R(4,k) is the Ramsey number representing the minimum N such that any 2-coloring of K_N contains either a monochromatic K_4 or a monochromatic K_k.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Ramsey numbers R(s,t) as the minimum N guaranteeing monochromatic cliques in 2-colorings. We prove basic properties (symmetry, R(1,t)=1, R(2,t)=t) and state the historical bounds. The main result follows from the Mattheus-Verstraete theorem establishing R(4,k) ≥ c·k³/(log k)⁴.",
