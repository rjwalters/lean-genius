When P = {2,3}, these are the 3-smooth numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, ...\n\nThe series sums reciprocals of successive LCMs of these numbers.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet P be a finite set of primes with |P| >= 2.\nLet {a_1 < a_2 < ...} be the set of positive integers whose prime divisors are all in P.\nLet L_n = [a_1, ..., a_n] be the LCM of the first n such integers.\n\n**Question:** Is the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{L_n}$ irrational?\n\n**Status:**\n- Finite P: OPEN\n- Infinite P: SOLVED (always irrational, 'simple exercise' per Erdos)\n- Finite P, distinct terms only: SOLVED (irrational)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **P-smooth Numbers:** Define IsPSmooth P n predicate\n\n2. **Enumeration:** Define smoothSeq P as the sequence of P-smooth numbers\n\n3. **Partial LCM:** Define L_n = lcm(a_0, ..., a_{n-1})\n\n4. **The Series:** Define lcmSeries P = sum of 1/L_n\n\n5. **Main Conjecture:** State erdos_269 as axiom for finite P\n\n6. **Infinite Case:** State erdos_269_infinite as axiom (SOLVED)\n\n7. **P-adic Analysis:** Key to understanding LCM growth patterns\n\n8. **Examples:** Work through P = {2,3} case explicitly",
