    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #686 from [Er79d] asks whether all integers N ≥ 2 can be expressed as ratios of products of consecutive integers. Products of k consecutive integers equal k! * C(n+k, k), connecting to factorials and binomial coefficients. Related to Problem #677.",
    "problemStatement": "Can every integer N ≥ 2 be written as ∏_{i=1}^k (m+i) / ∏_{i=1}^k (n+i) for some k ≥ 2 and m ≥ n + k? The constraints ensure non-trivial non-overlapping ranges with ratio > 1. OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines consecutiveProduct, ratioExpression (over Q), IsRepresentable, Representable, and ErdosConjecture686. Structural properties (numerator > denominator, ratio > 1, monotonicity) and binomial connections are axiomatized. Examples verified via native_decide. Proved: erdos_686_statement (simp).",

      "P(n,k) = (n+k)!/n! = k! * C(n+k, k)",

      "k ≥ 2 excludes trivial single-factor case",
      "The ratio C(m+k,k)/C(n+k,k) must be an integer — subtle divisibility",
      "For fixed n, k, the representable set is infinite (ratio increases with m)"
