(Tenenbaum has told me that they received \\$650 for their solution.)\n\nIn \\cite{Er64h} claimed a proof that the set of integers $n$ with divisors\\[d_1<d_2<d_1(1+(\\log n)^{-\\beta})\\]has density $1$ if $\\beta<\\log 3-1$, but this claim was retracted in \\cite{ErHa79}. Erd\\H{o}s and Hall \\cite{ErHa79} proved that this set has density $0$ if $\\beta >\\log 3-1$ (in a stronger quantitative form). The proof of Maier and Tenenbaum \\cite{MaTe84} proves that the density is $1$ if $\\beta<\\log 3-1$.\n\nThis is discussed in problem E3 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\nSee also [449] and [884].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er64h] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On some applications of probability to analysis and number\ntheory.
