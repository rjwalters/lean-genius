  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the 'propinquity' (closeness) of divisors. Erdős posed it in 1979, asking whether almost all integers have two divisors within a factor of 2 of each other. He initially claimed a proof in 1964 but retracted it in 1979 with Hall. The complete solution came from Maier and Tenenbaum in 1984, who also established the precise threshold β* = log 3 - 1 for the refined version. Tenenbaum reported receiving $650, more than the advertised $250 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove that the density of integers n which have two divisors d₁, d₂ with d₁ < d₂ < 2d₁ exists and equals 1. The stronger version asks for any constant c > 1 instead of 2.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization captures the main theorem by Maier-Tenenbaum and the phase transition at β* = log 3 - 1. For β < β*, almost all integers have (β)-close divisors; for β > β*, almost none do. The proof uses probabilistic number theory, divisor distribution theory, and moment calculations.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Prime powers have no close divisors (consecutive divisors differ by factor p ≥ 2)",
      "Most integers have many prime factors, causing divisors to cluster",
      "The critical threshold β* = log 3 - 1 ≈ 0.0986 governs the phase transition",
      "Erdős's 1964 proof was flawed but the conjecture was correct",
      "The Erdős-Kac theorem (normal distribution of prime factors) underlies the result"
