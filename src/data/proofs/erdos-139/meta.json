Prove that $r_k(N)=o(N)$.\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s and Tur\\'{a}n. Proved by Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{Sz75}. The best known bounds are due to Kelley and Meka \\cite{KeMe23} for $k=3$ (with further slight improvements in \\cite{BlSi23}), Green and Tao \\cite{GrTa17} for $k=4$, and Leng, Sah, and Sawhney \\cite{LSS24} for $k\\geq 5$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er80} Erd\\H{o}s reports that Rothe-Ille was given the problem of estimating $r_k(n)$ by Schur in the 1930s, and so 'perhaps Schur conjectured $r_k(N)=o(N)$ before Tur\\'{a}n and myself'.\n\nSee also [3].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BlSi23] T.
