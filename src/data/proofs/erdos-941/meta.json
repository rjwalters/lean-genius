    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #941 (Sums of Three Powerful Numbers)**\n\n**Origin:**\nErdős and Ivić posed this problem in 1986 at Oberwolfach: Are all sufficiently large integers the sum of at most three powerful numbers?\n\n**Powerful Numbers:**\nA number n is powerful (or squarefull) if every prime dividing n divides it at least twice: p | n → p² | n. Equivalently, n = a²b³ for some a, b ≥ 1.\n\n**Heath-Brown's Proof (1988):**\nHeath-Brown proved the affirmative answer using methods from the theory of ternary quadratic forms.\n\n**Related Problems:**\n- #940: Other variants of powerful representations\n- #1107: Generalization to r-powerful numbers (p | n → p^r | n)",
