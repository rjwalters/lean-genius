A theorem of Sylvester and Schur says that for any $1\\leq i\\leq n/2$ there exists some prime $p>i$ which divides $\\binom{n}{i}$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Szekeres further conjectured that $p\\geq i$ can be improved to $p>i$ except in a few special cases. In particular this fails when $i=2$ and $n$ being some particular powers of $2$. They also found some counterexamples when $i=3$, but only one counterexample when $i\\geq 4$:\\[\\textrm{gcd}\\left(\\binom{28}{5},\\binom{28}{14}\\right)=2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5.\\]This is mentioned in problem B31 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
