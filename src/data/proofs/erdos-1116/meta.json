    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1116**\n\nThis problem explores extreme behavior in the value distribution of entire functions, a fundamental topic in complex analysis.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Problem 1.25 in Hayman [Ha74], attributed to Erdős\n- Gol'dberg [Go78]: \"Counting functions of sequences of a-points for entire functions\" - constructed entire functions with extreme value distribution\n- Toppila [To76]: \"On the counting function for the a-values of a meromorphic function\" - independent construction\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- n(r, a) = number of solutions to f(z) = a in |z| < r\n- Question: Can n(r, a)/n(r, b) be unbounded for ALL pairs a ≠ b?\n- Surprising because Nevanlinna theory says values are typically taken with equal frequency on average",

    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Meromorphic Functions:** Define IsMeromorphic and IsEntire\n\n2. **Counting Function:** Define aPoints and countingFunction n(r, a)\n\n3. **Extreme Property:** Define HasUnboundedRatio and HasExtremeValueDistribution\n\n4. **Main Result:** Axiomatize Gol'dberg-Toppila existence theorem\n\n5. **Nevanlinna Context:** Define characteristic, integratedCounting, deficiency\n\n6. **Key Insight:** Axiomatize oscillation behavior (n vs N)\n\n7. **Construction Tools:** Define IsLacunarySeries, WeierstrassProduct\n\n8. **Non-examples:** Show exponential and polynomials don't have this property",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1116 asks whether there exists an entire function f such that for every a ≠ b, the ratio n(r,a)/n(r,b) is unbounded. Gol'dberg (1978) and Toppila (1976) proved YES by constructing such functions. This is surprising because Nevanlinna theory says values are typically taken with roughly equal frequency on average. The key insight is that the pointwise counting function n(r,a) can oscillate wildly while the integrated function N(r,a) remains bounded.",
    "implications": "**Complex Analysis Connections**\n\n1. **Nevanlinna Theory:** The deficiency sum ∑δ(a) ≤ 2 controls average behavior but not oscillations\n\n2. **Value Distribution:** Entire functions can have extremely irregular value distribution despite global constraints\n\n3. **Pointwise vs Average:** The difference between n(r,a) and N(r,a) = ∫n/t dt allows for wild oscillations\n\n4. **Construction Techniques:** Lacunary series and Weierstrass products are powerful tools for building pathological examples\n\n5. **Zeros vs a-Points:** The structure of a-points {z : f(z) = a} can differ dramatically for different a",
