(i.e. such that deleting any element creates infinitely many $n\\not\\in A+A$)\n\nWhat if $1_A\\ast 1_A(n) >\\epsilon \\log n$ (for all large $n$, for arbitrary fixed $\\epsilon>0$)?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Nathanson \\cite{ErNa79}, who proved that this is true if $1_A\\ast 1_A(n) > (\\log \\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\\log n$ for all large $n$.\n\nH\\\"{a}rtter \\cite{Ha56} and Nathanson \\cite{Na74} proved that there exist additive bases which do not contain any minimal additive bases.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Nathanson \\cite{ErNa89} proved that, for any $t$, there exists $A$ such that $1_A\\ast 1_A(n)\\geq t$ for all large $n$ and yet $A$ does not contain a minimal asymptotic basis of order $2$.\n\nSee also [870].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErNa79] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Nathanson, Melvyn B., Systems of distinct representatives and minimal bases in\nadditive number theory.
