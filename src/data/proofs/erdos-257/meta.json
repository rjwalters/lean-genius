Is\\[\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{2^n-1}\\]irrational?\n\n\n\nIf $A=\\mathbb{N}$ then this series is $\\sum_{n}\\frac{d(n)}{2^n}$, where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$, which Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er48} proved is irrational. In general, if $f_A(n)$ counts the number of divisors of $n$ which are elements of $A$ then\\[\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{2^n-1}=\\sum_n \\frac{f_A(n)}{2^n}.\\]The case when $A$ is the set of primes is [69]. This case (and when $A$ is the set of prime powers) was settled in the affirmative by Tao and Ter\\\"{a}v\\\"{a}inen \\cite{TaTe25}.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er68d} proved this sum is irrational whenever $(a,b)=1$ for all $a\\neq b\\in A$ and $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}<\\infty$ (and thought that the condition $(a,b)=1$ could be dropped by complicating his proof).\n\nThere is nothing special about $2$ here, and this sum is likely irrational with $2$ replaced by any integer $t\\geq 2$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er88c} Erd\\H{o}s goes further and speculates that $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{2^n-t_n}$ is irrational for every infinite set $A$ and bounded sequence $t_n$ (presumably of integers, and presumably excluding the case when $t_n=0$ for all $n$). This was disproved by Kova\\v{c} and Tao \\cite{KoTa24}, and in the comments Kova\\v{c} has sketched a proof that there exists some choice of $t_n$ with $1\\leq t_n\\leq 6$ such that this sum is rational.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er48] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On arithmetical properties of Lambert series.
