  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and has remained open for decades. The concept of cluster primes captures when the primes up to p are 'dense enough' that their pairwise differences cover all small even numbers.\n\nThe prize of $97 cleverly matches the first non-cluster prime. Blecksmith, Erdős, and Selfridge (1999) established strong upper bounds showing cluster primes are very sparse, and Elsholtz (2003) further improved these bounds. Terence Tao has identified this problem as 'difficult'.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition**: A prime p is a **cluster prime** if every even positive integer n with 2 ≤ n ≤ p-3 can be written as a difference of two primes q₁ - q₂ where q₁, q₂ ≤ p.\n\n**Question**: Are there infinitely many cluster primes?\n\n**Example**: 7 is a cluster prime because:\n- Primes ≤ 7: {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- Even numbers to cover: {2, 4}\n- 2 = 5 - 3 and 4 = 7 - 3\n\n**First failure**: 97 is the smallest non-cluster prime.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cluster primes using Finset operations to construct the set of prime differences. Key results axiomatized:\n\n1. **Concrete Examples**: Verified that small primes (2, 3, 5, 7) are cluster primes\n2. **First Non-Cluster**: 97 is the minimal non-cluster prime\n3. **Upper Bounds**:\n   - Blecksmith-Erdős-Selfridge: count ≪ x/(log x)^A for all A > 0\n   - Elsholtz: count ≪ x·exp(-c(log log x)²) for c < 1/8\n4. **Density Results**: Cluster primes have density 0 among all primes",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #17 remains OPEN. It asks whether there are infinitely many cluster primes - primes p where every even n ≤ p-3 is a difference of primes ≤ p. The first non-cluster prime is 97. Strong upper bounds show cluster primes are very sparse, but sparsity doesn't imply finiteness.",
    "implications": "**Mathematical Significance:**\n\n1. **Prime Distribution**: Cluster primes measure how 'well-distributed' primes are locally\n\n2. **Collective vs Individual**: Unlike twin primes (gaps), this concerns ALL prime differences simultaneously\n\n3. **Computational Limits**: Cannot be resolved by checking finite cases - requires structural insight\n\n4. **Related Problems**: Connected to Goldbach conjecture, twin primes, and prime gap questions",
