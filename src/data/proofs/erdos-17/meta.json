    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that every even number $n\\leq p-3$ can be written as a difference of primes $n=q_1-q_2$ where $q_1,q_2\\leq p$? The first prime without this property is $97$. The sequence of such primes is A038133 in the OEIS. These are called cluster primes. Blecksmith, Erdős, and Selfridge [BES99] proved that the number of such primes is\\[\\ll_A \\frac{x}{(\\log x)^A}\\]for every $A>0$, and Elsholtz [El03] improved this to\\[\\ll x\\exp(-c(\\log\\log x)^2)\\]for every $c View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 December 2025.",
