  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Practical numbers were introduced by Srinivasan (1948). Stewart and Sierpiński (1954-55) gave a complete characterization via prime factorization. Erdős showed h(n!) < n, and Vose (1985) proved infinitely many m have h(m) = O(√log m). The question of whether h(n!) is subpolynomial remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "A positive integer m is practical if every integer 1 ≤ k < m can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of m. Let h(m) be the minimum number of divisors needed. Is h(n!) < n^ε for all ε > 0 (subpolynomial)? Or even h(n!) < (log n)^O(1) (polylogarithmic)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines practical numbers, proves small cases (1, 2 verified), and axiomatizes key theorems: Stewart-Sierpiński characterization, Erdős's bound h(n!) < n, Vose's polylog bound for special m. Also includes practical Goldbach (proven!) and practical twins (infinite!).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Practical numbers were used by Fibonacci (1202) for Egyptian fractions",
      "All factorials and primorials are practical (closure under multiplication)",
      "Practical Goldbach is PROVEN: every even n is sum of two practical numbers",
      "Practical twin conjecture is PROVEN: infinitely many (p, p+2) both practical",
      "Density of practical numbers is 0, but computing h(m) is hard",
      "Gap between known bounds: h(n!) < n (Erdős) vs h(m) = O(√log m) for some m (Vose)"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #18 remains OPEN with a $250 prize. The formalization covers practical number theory including the Stewart-Sierpiński characterization, Erdős's bound h(n!) < n, Vose's polylog construction, and proven analogs of Goldbach and twin prime conjectures for practical numbers.",
    "implications": "Resolving whether h(n!) is subpolynomial requires understanding the fine structure of factorial divisors. The problem connects number theory, combinatorial optimization (subset sums), and extremal set theory.",
