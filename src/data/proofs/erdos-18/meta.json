  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Practical numbers were introduced by Srinivasan in 1948. The name reflects their 'practical' use: if m is practical, any weight k < m can be measured using denominations 1, d_2, d_3, ... where each d_i divides m. Stewart (1954) and Sierpinski (1955) independently characterized practical numbers via prime factorization: m is practical iff m=1 or m=2^a * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_k^{a_k} where each prime p_i <= sigma(m/p_i^{a_i})+1.\n\nErdos studied practical numbers extensively, proving their density is 0 and showing h(n!) < n. Vose (1985) improved this for special numbers, showing infinitely many m have h(m) = O(sqrt(log m)). The main conjecture asks whether h(n!) can be subpolynomial in n.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition:** A positive integer m is **practical** if every integer 1 <= k < m can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of m.\n\n**Function h(m):** The minimum number of divisors of m needed so that every k < m is representable.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Are there infinitely many practical m where h(m) < (log log m)^{O(1)}?\n2. Is h(n!) < n^{o(1)}? (Prize: $250)\n3. Even stronger: is h(n!) < (log n)^{O(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. **Core definitions:** IsPractical, IsRepresentable, h(m), PracticalNumbers\n2. **Small examples:** Prove 1, 2 are practical; axiomatize 4, 6, 12, powers of 2\n3. **Non-examples:** 3 and 5 are not practical\n4. **Characterization:** Stewart-Sierpinski theorem (simplified)\n5. **Bounds:** Erdos's h(n!) < n, Vose's h(m) <= C*sqrt(log m)\n6. **Main conjectures:** Both weak and strong forms\n7. **Related results:** Practical Goldbach, practical twins, density bounds\n8. **Egyptian fractions:** Fibonacci's historical connection",
