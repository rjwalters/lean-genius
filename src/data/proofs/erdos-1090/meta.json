Does there exist a finite set $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ such that, in any $2$-colouring of $A$, there exists a line which contains at least $k$ points from $A$, and all the points of $A$ on the line have the same colour?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75f} says Graham and Selfridge proved the answer is yes when $k=3$.\n\nHunter has observed that, for sufficiently large $n$, a generic projection of $[k]^n$ into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has this property, by the Hales-Jewett theorem.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er75f] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, On some problems of elementary and combinatorial geometry.
