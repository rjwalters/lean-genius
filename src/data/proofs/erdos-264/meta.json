  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem explores the concept of 'irrationality sequences' — sequences so robust that perturbing them by any bounded amount still yields irrational sums. Erdős and Graham introduced this concept in 1980.\n\nErdős asked specifically about 2ⁿ and n!, and initially speculated that polynomial-growth sequences might work. He later retracted this, noting irrationality sequences must grow at least exponentially.\n\nIn 2024, Vjekoslav Kovač and Terence Tao made breakthrough progress, proving 2ⁿ is NOT an irrationality sequence and establishing precise criteria for when sequences can or cannot be irrationality sequences. Their paper unified many related Erdős problems about irrationality.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition**: A sequence $a_n$ is an **irrationality sequence** if for every bounded integer sequence $b_n$ (with $a_n + b_n \\neq 0$ and $b_n \\neq 0$), the sum\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{a_n + b_n}$$\nis irrational.\n\n**Questions**:\n1. Is $a_n = 2^n$ an irrationality sequence? **NO** (Kovač-Tao 2024)\n2. Is $a_n = n!$ an irrationality sequence? **OPEN**\n\n**Known Example**: $a_n = 2^{2^n}$ IS an irrationality sequence.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. **The definition**: IsIrrationalitySequence captures the universal quantification over bounded perturbations\n\n2. **Kovač-Tao negative criterion**: If aₙ is strictly increasing with convergent ∑1/aₙ and positive liminf condition, then NOT an irrationality sequence. This shows 2ⁿ fails.\n\n3. **Kovač-Tao positive criterion**: For any F with F(n+1)/F(n) → ∞, irrationality sequences exist at that growth rate.\n\n4. **Known example**: 2^(2ⁿ) is an irrationality sequence.\n\nThe criteria are stated as axioms since their proofs require sophisticated analysis.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Robustness condition**: An irrationality sequence must stay irrational under ALL bounded perturbations. This is much stronger than just being irrational for the original sequence.",
      "**Growth rate boundary**: The Kovač-Tao criteria show the boundary is superexponential. Bounded ratio (like 2ⁿ) ⟹ fails. Ratio → ∞ (like 2^(2ⁿ)) ⟹ can succeed.",
      "**Why 2ⁿ fails**: There exists a bounded bₙ making ∑ 1/(2ⁿ + bₙ) rational. The construction uses the negative criterion's liminf condition.",
      "**Why n! is borderline**: The ratio (n+1)!/n! = n+1 grows, but not fast enough to apply the positive criterion. It also doesn't satisfy the negative criterion's conditions cleanly.",
      "**Connection to Ahmes series**: Kovač-Tao's paper addresses multiple Erdős problems about 'Ahmes series' (Egyptian fractions), showing deep connections between irrationality questions."
