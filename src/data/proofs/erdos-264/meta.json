Are $a_n=2^n$ or $a_n=n!$ examples of such a sequence?\n\n\n\nA possible definition of an 'irrationality sequence' (see also [262] and [263]). One example is $a_n=2^{2^n}$. In \\cite{ErGr80} they also ask whether such a sequence can have polynomial growth, but Erd\\H{o}s later retracted this in \\cite{Er88c}, claiming 'It is not hard to show that it cannot increase slower than exponentially'.\n\nKova\\v{c} and Tao \\cite{KoTa24} have proved that $2^n$ is not such an irrationality sequence. More generally, they prove that any strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that $\\sum\\frac{1}{a_n}$ converges and\\[\\liminf \\left(a_n^2\\sum_{k>n}\\frac{1}{a_k^2}\\right) >0 \\]is not such an irrationality sequence. In particular, any strictly increasing sequence with $\\limsup a_{n+1}/a_n <\\infty$ is not such an irrationality sequence.\n\nOn the other hand, Kova\\v{c} and Tao do prove that for any function $F$ with $\\lim F(n+1)/F(n)=\\infty$ there exists such an irrationality sequence with $a_n\\sim F(n)$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er88c] Erd\\\"{o}s, P., On the irrationality of certain series: problems and results.
