    "problemStatement": "We say that $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ is an essential component if $d_s(A+B)>d_s(B)$ for every $B\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ with $00$ such that $\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\geq (\\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$. Furthermore, Ruzsa proves that this is best possible, in that for any $c>0$ there exists an essential component $A$ for which $\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\leq (\\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$. In [Ru99] Ruzsa states \"The simplest set with a chance to be an essential component is the collection of numbers in the form $2^m3^n$ and Erdős often asked whether it is an essential component or not; I do not even have a plausible guess.\" View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 05 October 2025.",
