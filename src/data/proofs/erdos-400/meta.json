  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980, p. 77) studied g_k(n), the maximum excess of a₁ + ⋯ + aₖ over n subject to a₁!⋯aₖ! | n!. They proved g_k(n) = O(log n) but the precise asymptotics remain unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "For k ≥ 2, let g_k(n) = max{(a₁+⋯+aₖ) - n : a₁!⋯aₖ! ∣ n!}. (a) Is Σ_{n≤x} g_k(n) ~ cₖ · x · log x? (b) Is g_k(n) = cₖ · log x + o(log x) for almost all n ≤ x?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define FactorialDivides (the divisibility condition), sumExcess, and gExcess (the maximization). ErdosProblem400a states the average growth conjecture and ErdosProblem400b the concentration conjecture. The upper bound g_k(n) ≪ log n is axiomatized. The k = 2 case is developed with its binomial coefficient connection.",
