  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Posed by Erdős in 1971, with a generalization in 1992. The problem asks how close triangle-free graphs are to being bipartite, measured by edge deletions. The blow-up of C₅ shows n² deletions can be necessary; the conjecture is that n² always suffices.",
    "problemStatement": "Can every triangle-free graph on $5n$ vertices be made bipartite by deleting at most $n^2$ edges? The blow-up of $C_5$ shows this bound would be tight if true.",
    "proofStrategy": "Current approaches use regularity lemma techniques, flag algebras, and probabilistic methods. Balogh-Clemen-Lidický (2021) achieved the best known bound of 1.064n² using flag algebra computations.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Triangle-freeness (no 3-cycles) is local; bipartiteness (no odd cycles) is global",
      "The blow-up of C₅ is the extremal example showing n² is necessary",
      "The gap between n² (conjectured) and 1.064n² (proved) remains open",
      "Generalized conjecture: odd girth ≥ 2k+1 on (2k+1)n vertices needs ≤ n² deletions",
      "Problem is falsifiable: could be disproved by finite counterexample"

    "implications": "The problem quantifies the relationship between triangle-freeness and bipartiteness, with applications to graph partitioning and extremal graph theory.",
