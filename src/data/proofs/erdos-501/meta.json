  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects combinatorics with set theory and measure theory. Erdős and Hajnal (1960) proved arbitrarily large finite independent sets exist. Remarkably, the infinite case depends on set-theoretic axioms: Hechler (1972) showed NO under CH, while Newelski-Pawlikowski-Seredyński (1987) showed YES for closed sets.",
    "problemStatement": "For every x ∈ ℝ, let A_x ⊂ ℝ be a bounded set with outer measure < 1. A set X is 'independent' if x ∉ A_y for all distinct x, y ∈ X. Must infinite independent sets exist?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the set family and independence definitions, state the Erdős-Hajnal theorem for finite independent sets, and capture the set-theoretic independence via Hechler's CH result and the NPS theorem for closed sets.",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #501, a remarkable example where the answer depends on set-theoretic axioms beyond ZFC. The Erdős-Hajnal theorem guarantees arbitrarily large finite independent sets, but infinite independence is false under CH (Hechler) yet true for closed families (NPS).",
