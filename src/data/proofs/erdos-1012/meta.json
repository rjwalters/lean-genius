    "historicalContext": "**Hamiltonian Cycle Extensions**\n\nA fundamental question in graph theory asks: how many edges guarantee a Hamiltonian cycle? Ore's theorem (1961) gives a sufficient condition. This problem generalizes to (n-k)-cycles.\n\n**The Edge Threshold**: The critical edge count C(n-k-1, 2) + C(k+2, 2) + 1 arises from extremal constructions. Below this threshold, graphs avoiding (n-k)-cycles exist; above it, they cannot.\n\n**Historical Development**:\n- Erdős (1962) proved f(k) exists for all k\n- Ore (1961): f(0) = 1 (Hamiltonian cycle case)\n- Bondy (1971): f(1) = 1\n- Woodall (1972): Complete solution showing f(k) ≤ 2k+3\n\n**The Pancyclic Surprise**: Woodall proved more than asked - dense graphs have cycles of ALL lengths from 3 to n-k, not just length n-k.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet k ≥ 0. Define f(k) as the minimum n₀ such that every graph on n ≥ n₀ vertices with at least:\n$$\\binom{n-k-1}{2} + \\binom{k+2}{2} + 1$$\nedges contains a cycle on n-k vertices.\n\n**Question**: Determine or estimate f(k).\n\n**Status**: SOLVED (Woodall 1972)\n\n**Answer**: f(k) ≤ 2k+3, and such graphs are pancyclic from 3 to n-k (have cycles of all intermediate lengths).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Solution Approach**\n\n1. **Base Cases**:\n   - k=0: Ore's Hamiltonian cycle theorem\n   - k=1: Bondy's extension to (n-1)-cycles\n\n2. **General Case (Woodall)**:\n   - Analyze the structure of graphs with many edges\n   - Use induction on k with careful edge counting\n   - Show such graphs are 'pancyclic' - they have cycles of all lengths\n\n3. **Extremal Examples**:\n   - Construct graphs with threshold-1 edges avoiding (n-k)-cycles\n   - These show the threshold is tight\n\n**Key Insight**: Dense graphs are highly connected, forcing not just one long cycle but a complete spectrum of cycle lengths.",
