Let $f(k)$ be such that every graph on $n\\geq f(k)$ vertices with at least $\\binom{n-k-1}{2}+\\binom{k+2}{2}+1$ edges contains a cycle on $n-k$ vertices. Determine or estimate $f(k)$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er62e} proved that $f(k)$ exists for all $k\\geq 0$; this is not immediately stated in \\cite{Er62e}, but Cambie has in the comments explained why the existence of $f(k)$ follows from the result of \\cite{Er62e}.\n\nOre \\cite{Or61} proved that $f(0)=1$, in other words, every graph on $n\\geq 1$ vertices with at least $\\binom{n-1}{2}+2$ edges contains a Hamiltonian cycle on $n$ vertices.\n\nBondy \\cite{Bo71b} proved that $f(1)=1$.\n\nWoodall \\cite{Wo72} proved that every graph on $n\\geq 2k+3$ vertices with at least $\\binom{n-k-1}{2}+\\binom{k+2}{2}+1$ edges contains a cycle on $l$ vertices for all $3\\leq l\\leq n-k$. This settles this question completely.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bo71b] Bondy, J. A., Large cycles in graphs. Discrete Math.
