More generally, S\\'{a}ndor shows that for any $n\\geq 2$ there exists a finite set $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}\\backslash\\{1\\}$ with $\\sum_{k\\in A}\\frac{1}{k}<n$ and no partition into $n$ parts each of which has $\\sum_{k\\in A_i}\\frac{1}{k}<1$.\n\nThe minimal counterexample is $\\{2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15\\}$, found by Tom Stobart.\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Sa97] S\\'{a}ndor, Csaba, On a problem of Erd\\H{o}s.
