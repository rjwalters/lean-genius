  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in 1971, motivated by the Turán problem. The Turán number ex(n, K₃) = ⌊n²/4⌋ is the maximum edges in a triangle-free graph. If we exceed this by k edges, we must have triangles—but can we find nearly k edge-disjoint ones? Erdős initially believed f(c) = 0 for all c, but Sauer's counterexample showed otherwise. Györi's 1988 solution gave the optimal bound f(c) ≪ c².",
    "problemStatement": "For every c > 0, does there exist f(c) such that every graph on n vertices with at least ⌊n²/4⌋ + k edges (where k < cn) contains at least k - f(c) edge-disjoint triangles?",
    "proofStrategy": "Györi's proof shows that excess edges beyond Turán bound 'must' form triangles that are nearly disjoint. The key insight is that in dense graphs, the extra edges cannot all concentrate in shared triangles—they must spread out. For small c, the graphs are close enough to the Turán graph that f(c) = 0 works. For larger c, Sauer's complete tripartite construction shows some loss is unavoidable.",
