At first Erd\\H{o}s thought $f(c)=0$ for larger values of $c$ but this is false: an example of Sauer proves that $f(2)\\geq 1$.\n\nSauer gave an example of a graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+2n-6$ many edges which contains only $2n-7$ many edge disjoint triangles: if $n=2r+4$ then $G$ is the complete tripartite graph on $[r]\\times [r]\\times [4]$, with a $K_4$ on the $[4]$ vertices also.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Gy\\\"{o}ri \\cite{Gy88} who proved that this is true with $f(c)\\ll c^2$, and also that $f(c)=0$ if $c<2$ for odd $n$ or $c<3/2$ for even $n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gy88] Gy\\H{o}ri, E., On the number of edge-disjoint triangles in graphs of given\nsize.
