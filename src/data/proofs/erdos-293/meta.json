  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Egyptian fractions (sums of distinct unit fractions) have been studied since antiquity. Erdős asked how fast v(k) grows - the smallest denominator that never appears in a k-term decomposition of 1. Recent work by van Doorn and Tang (2025) significantly improved the lower bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 1 and let v(k) be the minimal integer not appearing in any solution to 1 = 1/n₁ + ... + 1/nₖ with distinct n₁ < ... < nₖ. Estimate the growth of v(k).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Egyptian fraction decompositions, the function v(k), and the Vardi sequence. Both lower bounds (factorial, then e^{k²}) and upper bounds (doubly exponential) are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Vardi sequence uₙ = uₙ₋₁(uₙ₋₁ + 1) controls the upper bound",
      "The Vardi constant c₀ ≈ 1.26408 appears in the asymptotic bound",
      "Van Doorn-Tang (2025) improved the lower bound from k! to e^{ck²}",
      "The gap between bounds (e^{k²} vs e^{2^k}) is enormous"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #293 is OPEN. The function v(k) counts the smallest missing denominator in k-term Egyptian fraction decompositions of 1. Current best bounds: e^{ck²} ≤ v(k) ≤ k·c₀^{2^k}, with an enormous gap between them.",
    "implications": "Understanding v(k) requires deep insight into which denominators can participate in Egyptian fraction decompositions. The connection to Problem 304 suggests the true growth may be doubly exponential.",
