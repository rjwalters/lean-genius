    "historicalContext": "**Partitioning Edges into Cliques**\n\nA chordal graph is one with no induced cycles of length greater than 3 - equivalently, every cycle of length ≥ 4 has a 'chord' (edge connecting non-adjacent cycle vertices). These graphs arise naturally in sparse matrix computations, database theory, and phylogenetics.\n\n**The Question**: How efficiently can we partition the edges of a chordal graph into cliques? The trivial bound is that each edge is its own clique, giving O(n²) cliques. Can we always do better - specifically, n²/6 + O(n) cliques?\n\n**The Extremal Example**: Consider n/3 vertices forming a complete graph K_{n/3}, and 2n/3 isolated vertices. Connect every vertex in the clique to every isolated vertex. This graph is chordal (it's actually a split graph), and any clique partition requires ≈ n²/6 cliques.\n\n**Known Bounds**: Erdős, Ordman, and Zalcstein proved (1/4 - ε)n² suffices for some small ε > 0, but the gap to n²/6 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet G be a chordal graph on n vertices (no induced cycles of length > 3). Can the edges of G be partitioned into n²/6 + O(n) many cliques?\n\n**Key Definitions**:\n- **Chordal graph**: Every cycle of length ≥ 4 has a chord\n- **Clique partition**: Partition of edges into complete subgraphs\n- **Split graph**: Vertices partition into a clique and independent set (special case of chordal)\n\n**Known Results**:\n- Lower bound: n²/6 + O(n) is sometimes necessary (extremal construction)\n- Upper bound: (1/4 - ε)n² cliques suffice (Erdős-Ordman-Zalcstein)\n- Split graphs: 3n²/16 + O(n) cliques suffice (Chen-Erdős-Ordman)\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach and Known Techniques**\n\n**Upper Bound Strategy**:\n1. Use the perfect elimination ordering (chordal graphs have one)\n2. Greedily form cliques around simplicial vertices\n3. Analyze how edges distribute across formed cliques\n\n**Lower Bound Construction**:\n1. Take K_{n/3} (complete graph on n/3 vertices)\n2. Add 2n/3 isolated vertices\n3. Connect all K_{n/3} vertices to all isolated vertices\n4. This split graph requires ≈ (n/3)(2n/3)/2 = n²/9 cliques for bipartite edges plus O(n) for K_{n/3}\n\n**The Gap**: Current upper bound (1/4 - ε)n² vs conjectured n²/6. Closing this gap requires either:\n- Better analysis of clique partitions in chordal graphs, or\n- A counterexample achieving > n²/6 + O(n) cliques",
