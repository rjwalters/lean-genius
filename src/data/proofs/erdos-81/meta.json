Can the edges of $G$ be partitioned into $n^2/6+O(n)$ many cliques?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s, Ordman, and Zalcstein \\cite{EOZ93}, who proved an upper bound of $(1/4-\\epsilon)n^2$ many cliques (for some very small $\\epsilon>0$). The example of all edges between a complete graph on $n/3$ vertices and an empty graph on $2n/3$ vertices show that $n^2/6+O(n)$ is sometimes necessary.\n\nA split graph is one where the vertices can be split into a clique and an independent set. Every split graph is chordal. Chen, Erd\\H{o}s, and Ordman \\cite{CEO94} have shown that any split graph can be partitioned into $\\frac{3}{16}n^2+O(n)$ many cliques.\n\nSee also [1017].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CEO94] Chen, Guan-Tao and Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Ordman, Edward T., Clique partitions of split graphs.
