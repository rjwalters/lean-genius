    "historicalContext": "**Partitioning Edges into Cliques**\n\nA chordal graph is one with no induced cycles of length greater than 3 — equivalently, every cycle of length ≥ 4 has a 'chord' (edge connecting non-adjacent cycle vertices). These graphs arise naturally in sparse matrix computations (Gaussian elimination), database theory (acyclic schemas), and phylogenetics (perfect phylogeny).\n\n**The Question**: How efficiently can we partition the edges of a chordal graph into cliques? The trivial upper bound assigns each edge its own clique, giving O(n²). Can we always achieve n²/6 + O(n)?\n\n**The Extremal Example**: Take K_{n/3} (complete graph on n/3 vertices) and 2n/3 isolated vertices. Connect every K_{n/3} vertex to every isolated vertex. This split graph has (n/3 choose 2) + (n/3)(2n/3) ≈ n²/6 + 2n²/9 edges. The bipartite edges between K_{n/3} and the isolated vertices cannot be efficiently grouped, requiring ≈ n²/6 cliques.\n\n**Known Bounds**: Erdős, Ordman, and Zalcstein (1993) proved (1/4 − ε)n² suffices for some small ε > 0. Chen, Erdős, and Ordman (1994) improved this to 3n²/16 + O(n) for the special case of split graphs. The gap between 1/6 ≈ 0.167 and 1/4 ≈ 0.25 remains open.\n\n**Structural Insight**: Chordal graphs are characterized by having a perfect elimination ordering (Dirac 1961, Fulkerson-Gross 1965) — vertices can be removed one at a time such that each removed vertex's remaining neighbors form a clique. This gives a polynomial-time recognition algorithm and a greedy clique partition, but the greedy approach is only a 2-approximation.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet G be a chordal graph on n vertices (no induced cycles of length > 3). Can the edges of G be partitioned into n²/6 + O(n) many cliques?\n\n**Key Definitions**:\n- **Chordal graph**: Every cycle of length ≥ 4 has a chord\n- **Clique partition**: Partition of edges into complete subgraphs\n- **Split graph**: Vertices partition into a clique and independent set (special case of chordal)\n\n**Known Results**:\n- Lower bound: n²/6 + O(n) is sometimes necessary (extremal construction)\n- Upper bound: (1/4 − ε)n² cliques suffice (Erdős-Ordman-Zalcstein)\n- Split graphs: 3n²/16 + O(n) cliques suffice (Chen-Erdős-Ordman)\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach and Known Techniques**\n\n**Upper Bound Strategy** (lines 153–167):\n1. Use the perfect elimination ordering (chordal ↔ PEO, line 246)\n2. The PEO-based greedy algorithm gives a 2-approximation (line 259)\n3. The Erdős-Ordman-Zalcstein bound of (1/4 − ε)n² (line 158) uses structural analysis beyond greedy\n\n**Lower Bound Construction** (lines 129–147):\n1. Take K_{n/3} (complete graph on n/3 vertices)\n2. Add 2n/3 isolated vertices and connect all K_{n/3} vertices to all isolated vertices\n3. This split graph (line 132) requires ≈ n²/6 cliques\n4. The `lower_bound` theorem (line 140) derives the chordal lower bound from the split graph construction via `split_is_chordal`\n\n**The Gap** (lines 190–206):\nCurrent upper bound coefficient 1/4 vs conjectured 1/6, a factor of 3/2. Closing this requires either:\n- Better structural analysis of chordal clique partitions, or\n- A counterexample exceeding n²/6 + O(n)\n\n**Main Theorems** (lines 309–333):\n- `erdos_81_summary`: combines the lower bound and gap analysis\n- `erdos_81`: combines the upper bound and PEO 2-approximation for any chordal graph",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #81 asks whether every chordal graph on n vertices can have its edges partitioned into n²/6 + O(n) cliques. The extremal split graph K_{n/3} + 2n/3 isolated vertices achieves the lower bound n²/6. The Erdős-Ordman-Zalcstein upper bound is (1/4 − ε)n², leaving a gap factor of ~1.5 in the leading coefficient. The Chen-Erdős-Ordman bound of 3n²/16 for split graphs is a partial result. The problem remains OPEN.",
    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance**\n\n1. **Structural Graph Theory**: Connects chordal graph structure to edge partition complexity; a resolution would reveal which structural property of chordal graphs limits clique partition efficiency\n\n2. **Split Graphs as Extremal**: The 3n²/16 result for split graphs and the fact that the extremal construction is split suggest these are the hardest case\n\n3. **Perfect Elimination**: The PEO characterization of chordal graphs is central — the 2-approximation via greedy PEO shows the structure helps, but optimal exploitation remains open\n\n4. **Applications**: Chordal graphs appear in sparse matrix factorization (fill-in minimization), constraint satisfaction (arc consistency), and database theory (acyclic schemas)",
