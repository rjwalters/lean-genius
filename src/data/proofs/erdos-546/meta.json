  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1984, asking whether the Ramsey number of a graph G with m edges is at most exponential in √m. Sudakov proved this in 2011. Earlier, Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (2003) proved the bipartite case. The multi-color version (≥3 colors) remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph with no isolated vertices and m edges. Is R(G) ≤ 2^{O(√m)}? This asks whether the Ramsey number grows at most exponentially in the square root of the edge count.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the Ramsey number definition, Sudakov's theorem, the bipartite case (AKS 2003), the multi-color generalization (open), and specific graph classes (paths, cycles, complete bipartite). We also formalize the connection to Problem #545.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #546 on Ramsey numbers and edge count. Sudakov (2011) proved R(G) ≤ 2^{O(√m)}, solving the 2-color case. The bipartite case was proved earlier by AKS (2003). The analogous question for ≥3 colors remains open.",
    "implications": "This result connects graph structure (edge count) to Ramsey-theoretic complexity. It shows that graphs with few edges have relatively small Ramsey numbers, which has applications in extremal graph theory.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does R_r(G) ≤ 2^{O(√m)} hold for r ≥ 3 colors?",
      "What is the precise constant in Sudakov's bound?",
      "Can the bound be improved for specific graph families?"
