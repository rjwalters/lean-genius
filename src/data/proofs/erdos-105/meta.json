    "historicalContext": "**Rich Lines Avoiding Obstacles**\n\nThis problem asks about finding 'rich' lines (containing multiple points from a set A) that avoid a set of obstacles B. It connects to the classical Szemerédi-Trotter theorem on point-line incidences.\n\n**The Conjecture (Erdős-Purdy 1995)**: Given n points A (not all collinear) and n-3 obstacle points B, there should exist a line containing ≥2 points of A and no points of B.\n\n**The Disproof**: Xichuan found three explicit counterexamples, disproving the conjecture. The $50 prize was for proof OR disproof.\n\n**Earlier Results**:\n- Hickerson: Conjecture fails with n-2 obstacles (showing n-3 is best possible if true)\n- Beck (1983) & Szemerédi-Trotter (1983): True with cn obstacles for some c > 0\n\n**Remaining Questions**: Does the conjecture hold with n-4 obstacles? Or with (1-o(1))n?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet A, B ⊂ ℝ² be disjoint sets with |A| = n, |B| = n-3, and A not contained on a single line. Must there exist a line containing at least two points from A and no points from B?\n\n**Answer**: NO (DISPROVED)\n\n**Counterexamples**: Xichuan provided three explicit counterexamples.\n\n**Prize**: $50 (awarded for disproof)\n\n**Bounds History**:\n- n-2 obstacles: FALSE (Hickerson construction)\n- n-3 obstacles: FALSE (Xichuan counterexamples)\n- cn obstacles: TRUE for some c > 0 (Beck, Szemerédi-Trotter)\n\n**Open**: What is the largest f(n) such that the statement holds with f(n) obstacles?",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Counterexamples**\n\nXichuan's disproof constructs specific point configurations where:\n1. A has n points, not all collinear\n2. B has n-3 points\n3. Every line through 2+ points of A also contains a point of B\n\n**Why Counterexamples Work**:\n- Carefully place B points on all 'rich' lines of A\n- The n-3 budget is just enough to block all such lines\n- Requires A to have few rich lines relative to its size\n\n**Beck-Szemerédi-Trotter Positive Result**:\n- Uses incidence bounds to show many rich lines exist\n- With only cn obstacles (c small), some rich line must be unblocked\n- The constant c is not optimized\n\n**Hickerson's n-2 Construction**:\n- Shows the conjecture fails at n-2\n- Xichuan extended this to n-3",
