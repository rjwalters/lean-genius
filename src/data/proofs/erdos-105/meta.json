    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $A,B\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be disjoint sets of size $n$ and $n-3$ respectively, with not all of $A$ contained on a single line. Is there a line which contains at least two points from $A$ and no points from $B$?\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy \\cite{ErPu95} (the prize is for a proof or disproof). A construction of Hickerson shows that this fails with $n-2$. A result independently proved by Beck \\cite{Be83} and Szemer\\'{e}di and Trotter \\cite{SzTr83} (see [211]) implies it is true with $n-3$ replaced by $cn$ for some constant $c>0$.\n\nThis has been disproved by Xichuan in the comments, who has found three explicit counterexamples. It remains possible that this holds with $n-4$ (or in general with $n-O(1)$ or $(1-o(1))n$).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Be83] Beck, J\\'{o}zsef, On the lattice property of the plane and some problems of Dirac, Motzkin and Erd\\H{o}s in combinatorial geometry.
