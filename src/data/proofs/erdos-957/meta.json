Let $f(d)$ be the number of times the distance $d$ is determined. Is it true that\\[f(d_1)f(d_k) \\leq (\\tfrac{9}{8}+o(1))n^2?\\]\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Pach \\cite{ErPa90}, who write that an 'easy' unpublished construction of Makai shows that this would be the best possible, and that it is 'not difficult' to prove\\[f(d_1)+f(d_k) \\leq 3n -c\\sqrt{n}+o(\\sqrt{n})\\]for some $c>0$, and ask what the best possible value of $c$ is.\n\nA stronger version of this problem (which implies the inequality in the problem statement) is that\\[f(d_1)\\leq 3n-2m+o(\\sqrt{n}),\\]where $m$ is the number of vertices of the convex hull of $A$.\n\nThe odd regular polygon shows that it is possible for $f(d_i)\\geq n$ for all $i$.\n\nThe original problem was solved by Dumitrescu \\cite{Du19}, who proved that\\[f(d_1)f(d_k)\\leq \\frac{9}{8}n^2+O(n).\\]See also [132] and [756].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Du19] Dumitrescu, Adrian, A product inequality for extreme distances.
