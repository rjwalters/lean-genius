  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, originally posed by Moon (1966), asks about efficiently partitioning the edges of a 2-colored complete graph using monochromatic cliques. Moon proved f(3) = 4 for n ≥ 8, meaning when partitioning 2-colored Kₙ into monochromatic triangles, at most 4 vertices remain uncovered. Erdős noted f(t) ≪ 4^t by comparison with Ramsey numbers, and asked whether f(t)^{1/t} → 1 or f(t) ≪ t.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(t) be minimal such that, in any two-coloring of the edges of Kₙ, the edges can be partitioned into vertex-disjoint monochromatic copies of Kₜ (not necessarily the same color) with at most f(t) vertices remaining. Estimate f(t). Is f(t)^{1/t} → 1? Is f(t) ≪ t?",
    "proofStrategy": "Burr, Erdős, and Spencer (1975) proved an exact formula: for n sufficiently large depending on t, f(t) = R(t, t-1) + x(t,n) where 0 ≤ x(t,n) < t and n + 1 ≡ R(t,t-1) + x (mod t). This shows f(t) ≈ R(t, t-1), which grows like 4^t/√t, answering both questions negatively.",

      "f(t) depends on the Ramsey number R(t, t-1), not just t",
      "Moon's f(3) = 4 is the first non-trivial case",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Burr, Erdős, and Spencer completely resolved this problem in 1975 by proving an exact formula: f(t) = R(t, t-1) + x(t,n) where the correction term x depends on n mod t. This shows f(t) grows like the Ramsey number R(t, t-1) ≈ 4^t/√t.",
    "implications": "The result answers both of Erdős's questions negatively: f(t)^{1/t} → 4 (not 1), and f(t) grows exponentially (not linearly). This connects the clique partition problem directly to Ramsey theory.",
