In particular, is it true that $f(t)^{1/t}\\to 1$? Is it true that $f(t)\\ll t$?\n\n\n\nA question of Moon \\cite{Mo66b}, who proved that $f(3)=4$, at least for $n\\geq 8$.\n\nPresumably Erd\\H{o}s intended to only ask this question for $n$ sufficiently large depending on $t$. Erd\\H{o}s notes that $f(t)\\ll 4^t$, by comparing to the Ramsey number $R(t)$.\n\nBurr, Erd\\H{o}s, and Spencer \\cite{BES75} proved that, for $n$ sufficiently large depending on $t$,\\[f(t)=R(t,t-1)+x(t,n),\\]where $0\\leq x(t,n)<t$ is such that $n+1\\equiv R(t,t-1)+x\\pmod{t}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BES75] Burr, S.
