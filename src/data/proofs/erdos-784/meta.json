Does there exist a $c>0$ (depending on $C$) such that, for all sufficiently large $x$, if $A\\subseteq [1,x]$ has $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}\\leq C$ then\\[\\#\\{ m\\leq x : a\\nmid m\\textrm{ for all }a\\in A\\}\\gg\\frac{x}{(\\log x)^c}?\\]\n\n\n\nAn example of Schinzel and Szekeres \\cite{ScSz59} shows that this would be best possible (up to the value of $c$).\n\nSee also [542].\n\nIn the comments jif has noted that the answer is trivially no for every $C\\geq 1$ with $A=\\{1\\}$. Presumably (as is usual in these kind of questions) the assumption that $1\\not\\in A$ is intended. jif also notes that a lower bound of $(1-C)x$ is trivial by the union bound if $0<C<1$.\n\nLet $H_C(x)$ be the minimum value of\\[\\#\\{ m\\leq x : a\\nmid m\\textrm{ for all }a\\in A\\}\\]as $A$ ranges over all subsets of $\\{2,\\ldots,\\lfloor x\\rfloor\\}$ with $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}\\leq C$, so that this question asks whether\\[H_C(x)\\gg \\frac{x}{(\\log x)^{O_C(1)}}\\]for all $C>0$.\n\nFor $C=1$ it is known that\\[H_1(x)\\asymp \\frac{x}{\\log x}.\\]The lower bound is due to Ruzsa \\cite{Ru82}, and the upper bound is due to Saias \\cite{Sa98}. More precise estimates (including a conjectured asymptotic formula of $\\sim c\\frac{x}{\\log x}$ for an explicit $c\\approx 0.878$) are given by Weingartner \\cite{We25}.\n\nFor fixed $C>1$ Ruzsa answered this question in the negative, and in fact\\[H_C(x)=x^{e^{1-C}+o(1)}.\\]This was improved by Weingartner \\cite{We25} who proved (for any fixed $C>1$)\\[H_C(x)\\asymp \\frac{x^{e^{1-C}}}{\\log x}.\\]Together these answer the given question (positively for $0<C\\leq 1$ and negatively for $C>1$).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ru82] Ruzsa, Imre Z., On the small sieve. {II}. {S}ifting by composite numbers.
