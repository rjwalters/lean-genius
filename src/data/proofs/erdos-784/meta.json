  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem studies the interplay between reciprocal sums and sieving. Schinzel-Szekeres (1959) showed the polynomial bound is best possible. Ruzsa (1982) established the C = 1 lower bound and showed the answer is NO for C > 1. Saias (1998) proved the matching upper bound for C = 1. Weingartner (2025) gave precise asymptotics for all C, completing the picture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let C > 0. Does there exist c > 0 (depending on C) such that, for all sufficiently large x, if A ⊆ [1,x] has Σ_{n∈A} 1/n ≤ C then #{m ≤ x : a ∤ m for all a ∈ A} ≫ x/(log x)^c?",
    "proofStrategy": "The answer depends critically on whether C ≤ 1 or C > 1. For C ≤ 1, the reciprocal sum constraint is strong enough that a polynomial-in-log bound holds. For C = 1 specifically, H₁(x) ≍ x/log x. For C > 1, the constraint is too weak: H_C(x) ≍ x^{e^{1-C}}/log x, which is sublinear and doesn't satisfy any polynomial-log bound.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The transition point is C = 1—a sharp phase transition in sieving behavior",
      "For C < 1, the union bound gives a linear lower bound (1-C)x, so any c works",
      "For C = 1, H₁(x) ≍ x/log x is the tight asymptotic (Ruzsa lower, Saias upper)",
      "For C > 1, H_C(x) ≍ x^{α}/log x where α = e^{1-C} < 1—sublinear growth",
      "The exponent α = e^{1-C} comes from analyzing optimal sieving sets",
      "Schinzel-Szekeres showed x/(log x)^c bound is best possible for C = 1"
