  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether the primes form the largest subset of {1,…,N} with strictly increasing Euler totient values. Since φ(p) = p-1 for primes, the primes naturally form such a set of size π(N). Tao resolved this in 2023, proving |A| ≤ (1 + O((log log x)⁵/log x))π(x).",

    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines increasing totient sets, the maximum size function, and the prime counting function. Tao's theorem is axiomatised: for every ε > 0, the maximum increasing totient set size is at most (1+ε)π(N) for large N.",
