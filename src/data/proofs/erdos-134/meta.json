Let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $<n^{1/2-\\epsilon}$.\n\nCan $G$ be made into a triangle-free graph with diameter $2$ by adding at most $\\delta n^2$ edges?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, who proved that this is the case when $G$ has maximum degree $\\ll \\log n/\\log\\log n$. A construction of Simonovits shows that this conjecture is false if we just have maximum degree $\\leq Cn^{1/2}$, for some large enough $C$.\n\nIn this note Alon solves this problem in a strong form, in particular proving that a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $<n^{1/2-\\epsilon}$ can be made into a triangle-free graph with diameter $2$ by adding at most $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ edges.\n\nSee also [618].\n\n\nBack to the problem",
