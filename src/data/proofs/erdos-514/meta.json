  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #514 asks three questions about the growth of transcendental entire functions along paths to infinity. Part 1 (existence of a path where |f(z)/z^n| → ∞ for all n) was proved by Boas (unpublished). Parts 2 (path length estimates) and 3 (faster than M(r)^ε growth) remain open. The formalization defines entire functions, transcendental functions, paths to infinity, and the relevant growth conditions, then axiomatizes Boas's result.",
    "implications": "**Complex Analysis Connections**\n\n1. **Maximum Modulus Principle:** M(r) is non-decreasing, relating to the geometry of level curves\n\n2. **Wiman-Valiron Theory:** The behavior of f near its maximum modulus points explains why super-polynomial paths exist\n\n3. **Growth Orders:** The order ρ = lim sup (log log M(r))/(log r) classifies entire functions by growth rate\n\n4. **Path Selection:** The existence proof is non-constructive; explicit path constructions would be valuable\n\n5. **Geometric Measure:** Part 2 connects function theory to curve lengths, a rare interface",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Can the path length in Part 2 be bounded by a function of M(r)?",
      "Does a path exist with |f(z)| growing faster than M(r)^ε (Part 3)?",
      "Can Boas's path be made explicit for specific functions like e^z?",
      "What is the relationship between path selection and the order of f?",
      "How does the central index ν(r) determine optimal path properties?"
