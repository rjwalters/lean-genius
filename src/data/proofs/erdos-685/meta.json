    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked about the precise count of distinct prime divisors of binomial coefficients C(n,k) in the range n^ε < k ≤ n^{1-ε}. A trivial lower bound is log C(n,k)/log n, which is tight near k = n. The conjecture gives an asymptotic formula involving the prime reciprocal sum.",

    "proofStrategy": "We define omega as the prime factors count, primeSumInRange for the prime reciprocal sum, and state the main conjecture as an asymptotic equality. The trivial lower bound and its tightness for k near n are axioms. Basic properties of omega are proved.",
