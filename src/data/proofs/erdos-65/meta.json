Is it true that\\[\\sum\\frac{1}{a_i}\\gg \\log k?\\]Is the sum $\\sum\\frac{1}{a_i}$ minimised when $G$ is a complete bipartite graph?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal.\n\nGy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Koml\\'{o}s, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{GKS84} have proved that this sum is $\\gg \\log k$, so that only the second question remains.
