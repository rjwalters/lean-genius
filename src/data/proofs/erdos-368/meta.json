P\\'{o}lya \\cite{Po18} proved that $F(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to\\infty$. Mahler \\cite{Ma35} showed that $F(n)\\gg \\log\\log n$. Schinzel \\cite{Sc67b} observed that for infinitely many $n$ we have $F(n)\\leq n^{O(1/\\log\\log\\log n)}$.\n\nThe truth is probably $F(n)\\gg (\\log n)^2$ for all $n$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er76d} conjectured that, for every $\\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $F(n) <(\\log n)^{2+\\epsilon}$.\n\nPasten \\cite{Pa24b} has proved that\\[F(n) \\gg \\frac{(\\log\\log n)^2}{\\log\\log\\log n}.\\]The largest prime factors of $n(n+1)$ are listed as A074399 in the OEIS.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er76d] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Problems and results on number theoretic properties of consecutive integers and related questions.
