  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Cayley-Hamilton theorem is named after Arthur Cayley (1821-1895) and William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865). Hamilton first proved a version for quaternions in 1853, while Cayley stated the theorem for matrices in 1858, though he only verified specific cases. The first complete proof for arbitrary matrices was given by Ferdinand Frobenius in 1878.\n\nThe theorem is fundamental to linear algebra and has applications in control theory, differential equations, and quantum mechanics. It shows that every matrix is a root of a polynomial of bounded degree, which has profound implications for computing matrix functions.",
    "problemStatement": "Theorem (Cayley-Hamilton): If A is an n×n matrix over a commutative ring, and p(λ) = det(λI - A) is its characteristic polynomial, then:\n\n$$p(A) = A^n - c_{n-1}A^{n-1} - \\cdots - c_1A - c_0I = 0$$\n\nwhere the c_i are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof in Mathlib uses a clever algebraic approach. The key insight is the identity relating the adjugate matrix to the determinant:\n\n$$A \\cdot \\text{adj}(A) = \\det(A) \\cdot I$$\n\nBy working with matrices over the polynomial ring and carefully manipulating the adjugate of (XI - A), the proof shows that evaluating the characteristic polynomial at A yields zero.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it's purely algebraic and works over any commutative ring, not just fields.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The characteristic polynomial encodes all eigenvalues (with multiplicity) as its roots",
      "Cayley-Hamilton implies that A^n can be expressed as a linear combination of I, A, A², ..., A^(n-1)",
      "When det(A) ≠ 0, the inverse A⁻¹ can be written as a polynomial in A",
      "For 2×2 matrices: A² - trace(A)·A + det(A)·I = 0, giving the explicit inverse formula",
      "The minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, so its degree is at most n"
