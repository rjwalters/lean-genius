  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The study of perfect numbers (σ(n) = 2n) dates to Euclid. Multiperfect numbers (σ(n) = kn for k ≥ 3) have been studied since the Renaissance. Erdős asked about the growth rate of k relative to n: Gronwall's 1913 theorem shows σ(n)/n can reach ~e^γ · log log n, so k = O(log log n) is the natural scale. The question is whether k-perfect numbers are constrained to k = o(log log n).",
    "problemStatement": "If n is k-perfect (σ(n) = k·n), must k = o(log log n)? That is, does the multiplicative perfection ratio grow strictly slower than log log n?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the sum-of-divisors function, define k-perfect numbers, state known examples for k ≤ 11, present Gronwall's upper bound and Robin's conditional inequality, and state the main o(log log n) conjecture alongside Guy's finiteness conjecture.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1053 asks whether k-perfect numbers must satisfy k = o(log log n). Robin's inequality gives k = O(log log n) conditionally on RH. Guy conjectures the stronger statement that each k ≥ 3 has only finitely many k-perfect numbers. The problem connects to the Riemann Hypothesis via Robin's criterion.",
    "implications": "A resolution would shed light on the extremal behavior of the sum-of-divisors function and the structure of highly composite numbers. The connection to Robin's inequality means progress could relate to the Riemann Hypothesis.",
