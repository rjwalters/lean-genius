    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $g(n)$ be minimal such that for any $A\\subseteq [2,\\infty)\\cap \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\lvert A\\rvert =n$ and any set $I$ of $\\max(A)$ consecutive integers there exists some $B\\subseteq I$ with $\\lvert B\\rvert=g(n)$ such that\\[\\prod_{a\\in A} a \\mid \\prod_{b\\in B}b.\\]Is it true that\\[g(n) \\leq (2+o(1))n?\\]Or perhaps even $g(n)\\leq 2n$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Sur\\'{a}nyi \\cite{ErSu59}, who proved that $g(n) \\geq (2-o(1))n$, and that $g(3)=4$. Their lower bound construction takes $A$ as the set of $p_ip_j$ for $i\\neq j$, where $p_1<\\cdots <p_\\ell$ is some set of primes such that $2p_1^2>p_\\ell^2$.\n\nGallai was the first to consider problems of this type, and observed that $g(2)=2$ and $g(3)\\geq 4$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er92c} Erd\\H{o}s offers '100 dollars or 1000 rupees', whichever is more, for a proof or disproof. (In 1992 1000 rupees was worth approximately \\$38.60.)\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Sur\\'{a}nyi similarly asked what is the smallest $c_n\\geq 1$ such that in any interval $I\\subset [0,\\infty)$ of length $c_n\\max(A)$ there exists some $B\\subseteq I\\cap \\mathbb{N}$ with $\\lvert B\\rvert=n$ such that\\[\\prod_{a\\in A} a \\mid \\prod_{b\\in B}b.\\]They prove $c_2=1$ and $c_3=\\sqrt{2}$, but have no good upper or lower bounds in general.\n\n\nSee also [709].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er92c] Erd\\\"{o}s, P., Some of my forgotten problems in number theory.
