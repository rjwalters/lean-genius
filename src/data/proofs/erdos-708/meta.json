    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #708**\n\nThis problem about divisibility of products has a rich history spanning decades.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Gallai: First considered such problems, established g(2) = 2 and g(3) ≥ 4\n- Erdős-Surányi (1959): Proved g(n) ≥ (2 - o(1))n and computed g(3) = 4\n- Erdős (1992): Offered \"$100 or 1000 rupees, whichever is more\" for proof/disproof\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe problem asks: given n arbitrary integers ≥ 2, how many consecutive integers are needed to guarantee their product is divisible by the product of the n integers? The answer is the function g(n).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $g(n)$ be minimal such that for any $A \\subseteq [2,\\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{N}$ with $|A| = n$ and any set $I$ of $\\max(A)$ consecutive integers, there exists $B \\subseteq I$ with $|B| = g(n)$ such that:\n$$\\prod_{a \\in A} a \\mid \\prod_{b \\in B} b$$\n\n**Question:** Is $g(n) \\leq (2 + o(1))n$? Or perhaps even $g(n) \\leq 2n$?\n\n**Known:**\n- $g(2) = 2$ (Gallai)\n- $g(3) = 4$ (Erdős-Surányi)\n- $g(n) \\geq (2 - o(1))n$ (lower bound)\n\n**Prize:** $100 (offered by Erdős)",

The problem asks whether g(n) ≤ (2 + o(1))n, where g(n) is the minimum number of consecutive integers needed to guarantee divisibility. Erdős-Surányi proved g(n) ≥ (2 - o(1))n, so if the conjecture is true, g(n) = (2 + o(1))n exactly.",
