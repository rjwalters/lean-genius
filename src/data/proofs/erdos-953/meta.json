  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #953**\n\nThis is a joint problem of Erdős and Sárközi concerning the maximum size of a 'distance-avoiding' set. The question asks: how large (in measure) can a subset of a disk be if no two points are at integer distance?\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős noted that 'Sárközi has the sharpest results, but nothing has been published yet'\n- Kovač adapted Sárközy's methods from problem #466 to establish lower bounds\n- The problem connects to broader questions about forbidden distance graphs\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nWe work in the Euclidean plane ℝ² with Lebesgue measure. The constraint is purely metric: for any distinct a, b ∈ A, we require |a - b| ∉ ℤ.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet A ⊂ {x ∈ ℝ² : |x| < r} be a measurable set with no integer distances—that is, |a - b| ∉ ℤ for any distinct a, b ∈ A.\n\n**Question:** What is the maximum possible measure of A?\n\nDefine M(r) = sup{μ(A) : A ⊆ B(0,r) avoids integer distances}. What is the asymptotic behavior of M(r)?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Distance Predicates:**\n   - IsIntegerDistance: dist(a,b) ∈ ℤ\n   - AvoidsIntegerDistances: no pair has integer distance\n\n2. **Geometric Setup:**\n   - openDisk(r): the ball of radius r\n   - maxMeasure(r): supremum over valid sets\n\n3. **Bounds:**\n   - Upper bound O(r) from geometric arguments\n   - Lower bound r^{0.26} from Kovač's construction\n\n4. **Constructions:**\n   - Thin annuli avoiding integer distances\n   - Connection to general forbidden distance problems\n\n5. **Related Problems:**\n   - Erdős #465 (upper bounds)\n   - Erdős #466 (lower bounds)",
