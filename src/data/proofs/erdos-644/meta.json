    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Fon-Der-Flaass, Kostochka, and Tuza (1992) studied the function f(k,r): the minimum covering set size for k-uniform set families with the r-wise pair intersection property. They determined exact values for r = 3, 4, 5, 6, showing a decreasing sequence of coefficients.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(k,r) be minimal such that if A₁, A₂, ... is a family of k-sets where every r sets share a common pair {x,y} intersecting all of them, then some set of size f(k,r) intersects all Aᵢ.

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the r-wise pair intersection property, the covering function f(k,r), known exact values from EFKT92, monotonicity properties, extremal constructions, sunflower connections, and the two main open questions about asymptotic behavior.",
