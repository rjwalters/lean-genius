  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The divisor function τ(n) counts how many positive integers divide n. Erdős Problem #975 asks whether the sum Σ_{n≤x} τ(f(n)) for an irreducible polynomial f has a precise asymptotic formula of the form c·x·log(x) for some constant c > 0.\n\nVan der Corput (1939) established the lower bound, showing the sum grows at least as fast as x log x. Erdős (1952) proved the matching upper bound using elementary methods, establishing that the growth is Θ(x log x).\n\nChristopher Hooley (1963) resolved the problem for irreducible quadratic polynomials, showing that an asymptotic formula exists with an explicit (though complicated) constant. The general case for higher-degree polynomials remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f \\in \\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible non-constant polynomial with $f(n) \\geq 1$ for all sufficiently large $n$. Does there exist a constant $c = c(f) > 0$ such that\n$$\\sum_{n \\leq x} \\tau(f(n)) \\sim c \\cdot x \\cdot \\log x$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the divisor counting function?\n\n**Status**:\n- **OPEN** for general polynomials\n- **SOLVED** for irreducible quadratics (Hooley, 1963)\n- **Known**: $x \\log x \\ll \\sum \\tau(f(n)) \\ll x \\log x$",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. The divisor sum function over polynomial values\n2. Van der Corput's lower bound (1939) as an axiom\n3. Erdős's upper bound (1952) as an axiom\n4. The main conjecture as an axiom (open problem)\n5. Hooley's theorem for quadratics as an axiom\n6. The famous n² + 1 example with constant 3/π\n\nThe deep analytic methods required for these results are beyond current Mathlib formalization. We verify basic properties of the divisor function computationally.",

      "**Divisor function τ(n)**: Counts divisors of n. For prime p, τ(p) = 2. Highly multiplicative: τ(mn) relates to τ(m)τ(n) when gcd(m,n)=1.",
      "**Why x log x?**: The average value of τ(n) for n ≤ x is approximately log x (Dirichlet). Summing over x terms gives x log x growth.",
      "**The n² + 1 constant**: Σ τ(n² + 1) ~ (3/π) x log x. The constant 3/π ≈ 0.9549 arises from the distribution of primes dividing values of n² + 1.",
      "**Hooley's breakthrough**: For quadratics, the constant c involves class numbers and the discriminant of the polynomial. McKee later gave more explicit formulas.",
      "**Why is the general case hard?**: Higher-degree polynomials have more complicated prime factorization patterns. The analytic methods don't extend easily."
