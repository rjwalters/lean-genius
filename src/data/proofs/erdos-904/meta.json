  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was conjectured by Béla Bollobás and Paul Erdős as a strengthening of Turán's theorem. While Turán's theorem guarantees that a graph with more than n²/4 edges must contain a triangle, the Bollobás-Erdős conjecture asked whether such a graph must contain a triangle whose vertices have high combined degree. C.S. Edwards proved the conjecture in 1978, showing that not only does a triangle exist, but we can find one where the sum of degrees is at least (3/2)n.",
    "problemStatement": "If G is a graph with n vertices and more than n²/4 edges, then G contains a triangle on vertices x, y, z such that d(x) + d(y) + d(z) ≥ (3/2)n, where d(v) denotes the degree of vertex v.",
    "proofStrategy": "Edwards' proof uses a careful analysis of the degree sequence and greedy selection of high-degree vertices. The key insight is that dense graphs must have many vertices of high degree, and these high-degree vertices are likely to form triangles among themselves. The proof combines degree counting arguments with structural properties of dense graphs.",
