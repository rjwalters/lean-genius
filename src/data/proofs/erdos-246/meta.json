The set $\\{a^kb^l: k,l\\geq 0\\}$ is complete - that is, every large integer is the sum of distinct integers of the form $a^kb^l$ with $k,l\\geq 0$.\n\n\n\nProved by Birch \\cite{Bi59}. This also follows from a later more general result of Cassels \\cite{Ca60} (see [254]).\n\nDavenport observed in \\cite{Bi59} that this is still true even with $l\\ll_{a,b}1$. Hegyv\\'{a}ri \\cite{He00b} gave an explicit upper bound for this threshold (which is quadruple exponential in $a$ and $b$). This was improved to triply exponential by Fang and Chen \\cite{FaCh17}.\n\nYu \\cite{Yu24} showed that one can write any large $n$ as the sum of distinct integers of this form, all of which are $> n/(\\log n)^{1+o(1)}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Bi59] Birch, B.
