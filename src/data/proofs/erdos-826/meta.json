  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #826 was posed by Paul Erdős in 1974 (referenced as [Er74b]). It asks a fundamental question about the growth of the divisor function τ(n) = σ₀(n) along arithmetic shifts: can we find infinitely many starting points n where τ(n+k) grows at most linearly in k? The problem is described as a stronger form of Erdős Problem #248.\n\nThe divisor function τ(n) counts the number of positive divisors of n. Its average order is log(n), established by Dirichlet's divisor problem, while its maximum order is much larger — roughly 2^{log(n)/log(log(n))} — achieved by highly composite numbers. The interplay between typical and extremal behavior is central to understanding this problem.\n\nTerence Tao has noted that Problem #826 appears difficult. The challenge lies in simultaneously controlling divisor counts across all shifts k ≥ 1 from a single starting point. While the constraint becomes easier for large k (since Ck grows), the constraint at k = 1 is extremely restrictive: it requires τ(n+1) ≤ C, meaning n+1 must have very few divisors. Standard sieve methods and analytic number theory techniques have not yet yielded a resolution.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many $n$ such that, for all $k \\geq 1$,\n$$\\tau(n + k) \\ll k?$$\n\nEquivalently: does there exist $C > 0$ such that the set\n$$S(C) = \\{n \\in \\mathbb{N} : \\tau(n+k) \\leq Ck \\text{ for all } k \\geq 1\\}$$\nis infinite?\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization builds a comprehensive framework for Problem #826 in ten parts:\n\n1. **Divisor function:** Define τ via Mathlib's σ 0 with examples and growth bounds.\n\n2. **Growth theory:** Axiomatize the average order (~ log n) and maximum order of τ.\n\n3. **Core condition:** Define linearBoundCondition and goodStartingPoints — the central objects.\n\n4. **Formal conjecture:** State the problem as ∃ C > 0, S(C) is infinite.\n\n5. **Relations:** Show #826 implies the weaker Problem #248.\n\n6. **Observations:** Analyze the constraint at small k and the role of primes.\n\n7. **Heuristics and smooth numbers:** Explain why the conjecture is plausible but hard to prove.\n\n8. **Difficulty analysis:** Document Tao's assessment and the structural challenges.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Linear Control:** The condition τ(n+k) ≤ Ck is strong — it requires simultaneous control at all shifts, with the tightest constraint at k = 1.",
      "**Primes Help:** If n+1 is prime, τ(n+1) = 2, easily satisfying the k=1 bound. But we need control at all k simultaneously.",
      "**Average vs. Extremal:** While τ(m) averages to log(m), individual values can be much larger, making uniform bounds hard.",
      "**Critical Range:** For large k (k ≫ log(n)/C), the bound is automatic. The difficulty is small k where divisor counts must be unusually low.",
      "**Stronger than #248:** This is a strengthening of Erdős Problem #248, making it at least as difficult."
