    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #824** asks about the density of coprime pairs sharing the same sum of divisors. The sum of divisors function σ(n) = Σ_{d|n} d is one of the most classical functions in number theory, studied since antiquity in connection with perfect and amicable numbers.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1974 (Erdős):** Proved limsup h(x)/x = ∞, showing infinitely many coprime σ-equal pairs exist with density exceeding any linear bound.\n- **2016 (Pollack-Pomerance):** Strengthened to h(x)/x → ∞, meaning the ratio grows without bound (not just unbounded limsup).\n\nThe question asks whether h(x) grows nearly as fast as the trivial upper bound x², which would mean coprime σ-equal pairs are remarkably common.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $h(x)$ count the number of pairs $(a, b)$ with $1 \\leq a < b < x$ such that $\\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and $\\sigma(a) = \\sigma(b)$.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that $h(x) > x^{2-o(1)}$?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- $h(x)/x \\to \\infty$ (Pollack-Pomerance 2016)\n- $h(x) \\leq x^2$ (trivial upper bound)\n\n**Gap:** We don't even know $h(x) > x^{1.01}$ for large $x$. The conjecture would imply nearly quadratic growth.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:** Define the sum-of-divisors function σ and the counting function h(x) for coprime σ-equal pairs.\n\n2. **Key Properties:** Prove basic facts about σ (σ(1) = 1, σ(n) ≥ n+1 for n > 1).\n\n3. **Known Results:** Axiomatize Erdős's 1974 result and the Pollack-Pomerance 2016 strengthening.\n\n4. **The Conjecture:** State the strong conjecture h(x) > x^{2-ε} precisely.\n\n5. **Variants:** Include the squarefree variant and Weisenberg's stronger condition.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #824 asks whether coprime pairs with equal sum of divisors are nearly as common as all pairs. The counting function h(x) is known to grow faster than linear (Pollack-Pomerance 2016), but the strong conjecture h(x) > x^{2-o(1)} remains open. The gap between known and conjectured bounds is enormous.",
