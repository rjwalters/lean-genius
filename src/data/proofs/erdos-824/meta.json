A complete proof that $h(x)/x\\to \\infty$ was provided by Pollack and Pomerance \\cite{PoPo16}.\n\nA similar question can be asked if we replace the condition $(a,b)=1$ with the condition that $a$ and $b$ are squarefree. Weisenberg suggests another variant, with the condition that there are no proper factors $u\\mid a$ and $v\\mid b$ such that $\\sigma(u)=\\sigma(v)$ and $(u,a/u)=(v,b/v)=1$, which is the weakest restriction one can impose that is still strong enough to eliminate trivial duplicates.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er74b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Remarks on some problems in number theory.
