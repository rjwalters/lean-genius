In other words, does the Cayley graph defined on $\\mathbb{Z}$ by a lacunary sequence have a finite chromatic number?\n\nKatznelson observed that a positive solution to the problem follows from the answer to [464], which yields an irrational $\\theta$ and $\\delta>0$ such that $\\inf_k \\| \\theta n_k\\|>\\delta$.\n\nIndeed, given such a $\\theta$ a colouring of $\\mathbb{N}$ using $\\ll \\delta^{-1}$ colours lacking any solution to $a-b\\in A$ can be produced by dividing $\\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ into disjoint intervals of length $\\leq \\delta$ and then colouring $n$ according to which interval $\\| \\theta n\\|$ belongs to.\n\nIn particular, the solution to [464] implies the answer to this question is yes, with the best known quantitative bound, due to Peres and Schlag \\cite{PeSc10}, being that there is a colouring with no solutions using at most\\[\\ll \\epsilon^{-1}\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\]colours.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ka01] Katznelson, Y., Chromatic numbers of Cayley graphs on {$\\Bbb Z$} and\nrecurrence.
