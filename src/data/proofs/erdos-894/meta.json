  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #894 asks whether Cayley graphs on ℤ defined by lacunary sequences have finite chromatic number. A sequence A = {n₁ < n₂ < ...} is lacunary if n_{k+1} ≥ (1+ε)n_k for some ε > 0. Katznelson (2001) connected this to Diophantine approximation (Problem #464). Peres and Schlag (2010) resolved both problems simultaneously, proving O(ε⁻¹ log(1/ε)) colors suffice.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A = {n₁ < n₂ < ...} ⊂ ℕ be a lacunary sequence with n_{k+1} ≥ (1+ε)n_k. Does there exist a finite coloring of ℕ with no monochromatic solutions to a - b ∈ A? Equivalently, does the Cayley graph on ℤ with connection set A have finite chromatic number? SOLVED: YES.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsLacunary, proves exponential growth, constructs Katznelson's coloring via circle intervals of length δ (from Problem #464's irrational θ), and derives the main theorem lacunary_finitely_colorable. Quantitative bounds from Peres-Schlag (2010) are axiomatized. Special cases (powers of 2 and 3) are proved from the main theorem.",
