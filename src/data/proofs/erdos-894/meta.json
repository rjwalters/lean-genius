  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**The Chromatic Number Question (1987)**\n\nErdős asked in 1987 whether Cayley graphs on ℤ defined by lacunary sequences have finite chromatic number. A sequence A = {n₁ < n₂ < ...} is lacunary if n_{k+1} ≥ (1+ε)n_k for some ε > 0. The question is whether ℕ can be finitely colored so that no two integers differing by an element of A share the same color.\n\n**Katznelson's Connection (2001)**\n\nYitzhak Katznelson made a crucial observation connecting this problem to Diophantine approximation (Problem #464). He showed that if there exists an irrational θ with inf_k ||θn_k|| > δ > 0 (where ||·|| is distance to nearest integer), then one can color using O(1/δ) colors by dividing the circle into intervals of length δ.\n\n**Peres-Schlag Resolution (2010)**\n\nYuval Peres and Wilhelm Schlag resolved both problems simultaneously in their paper 'Two Erdős problems on lacunary sequences.' They proved that O(ε⁻¹ log(1/ε)) colors suffice for a lacunary sequence with ratio (1+ε). This bound is essentially optimal.",
