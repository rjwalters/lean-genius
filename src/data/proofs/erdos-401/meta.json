Comparing to previous problems such as [728] and [729] it seems most likely that they intended to ask the formulation in the problem statement.\n\nSothanaphan, using ChatGPT, has found a disproof of the alternative statement with 'for all large $n$' instead: take $n=p_{r+1}^k-1$ for arbitrary $k$, whence the divisibility condition forces $a_1+a_2\\leq n+2p_{r+1}$.\n\nBarreto and Leeham have used ChatGPT to provide a proof of the stated problem (in fact essentially the same construction as their solution to [729]).\n\nSee also [400] and [729] (arguably this problem is a more precisely stated form of the latter).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
