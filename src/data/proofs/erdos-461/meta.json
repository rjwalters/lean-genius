  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from Erdős and Graham's 1980 monograph. They introduced the t-smooth component of an integer and asked whether the number of distinct smooth components in a short interval of length t is linear in t. They proved the weaker bound t/log t.",
    "problemStatement": "Define sₜ(n) as the largest divisor of n all of whose prime factors are less than t. Let f(n,t) = |{sₜ(m) : n < m ≤ n+t}|. Is f(n,t) ≫ t uniformly in n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the smooth component via filtering prime factors, states the main conjecture as a linear lower bound, and records the Erdős–Graham bound f(n,t) ≫ t/log t as an axiom.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The t-smooth component captures the 'smooth part' of an integer — the product of all small prime power divisors",
      "Erdős–Graham proved f(n,t) ≫ t/log t, falling short of the conjectured linear bound by a logarithmic factor",
      "The conjecture asks whether distinct smooth components are as numerous as possible in short intervals",
      "The upper bound f(n,t) ≤ t is immediate since only t integers are sampled"
