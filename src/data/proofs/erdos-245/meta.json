Is it true that\\[\\limsup_{N\\to \\infty}\\frac{\\lvert (A+A)\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}\\geq 3?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s writes it is 'easy to see' that this holds with $3$ replaced by $2$, and that $3$ would be best possible here. We do not see an easy argument that this holds with $2$, but this follows e.g. from the main result of Mann \\cite{Ma60}.\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by Freiman \\cite{Fr73}.\n\nSee also [899] for the difference set analogue.\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Fr73] Fre\\u{\\i}man, G.
