Does there exist some $c_k>0$ such that $G$ must contain an induced subgraph on at most $(1-c_k)n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$?\n\n\n\nThe case $k=3$ was a problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal \\cite{Er91}. The question for general $k$ was a conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp \\cite{EFRS90}, who proved that such a subgraph exists with at most $n-c_k\\sqrt{n}$ vertices. Mousset, Noever, and Skori\\'{c} \\cite{MNS17} improved this to\\[n-c_k\\frac{n}{\\log n}.\\]The full conjecture was proved by Sauermann \\cite{Sa19}, who proved this with $c_k \\gg 1/k^3$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EFRS90] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Faudree, R.
