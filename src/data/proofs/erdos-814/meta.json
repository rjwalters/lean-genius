    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #814: Minimum Degree Subgraphs**\n\nThis problem concerns a fundamental question in extremal graph theory: given a dense graph, can we always find a small induced subgraph with high minimum degree?\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős and Hajnal [Er91]: Studied the case k=3 as a standalone problem\n- Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, Schelp (1990): Formulated the general conjecture and proved the first quantitative bound of n - cₖ√n vertices\n- Mousset, Noever, Skorić (2017): Improved to n - cₖ·n/log(n) vertices\n- Sauermann (2019): Fully resolved the conjecture with cₖ ≫ 1/k³\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe edge threshold (k-1)(n-k+2) + C(k-2,2) + 1 is precisely chosen. Graphs with fewer edges can be constructed to avoid the desired subgraph, showing the bound is tight. The conjecture asks whether exceeding this threshold by even one edge forces a small minimum-degree-k subgraph.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nLet $k \\geq 2$ and $G$ be a graph with $n \\geq k-1$ vertices and\n$$(k-1)(n-k+2) + \\binom{k-2}{2} + 1$$\nedges. Does there exist some $c_k > 0$ such that $G$ must contain an induced subgraph on at most $(1-c_k)n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nSauermann (2019) proved the conjecture with $c_k \\gg 1/k^3$. This means for any $k$, there exists a constant $c_k$ of order at least $1/k^3$ such that every sufficiently dense graph contains a proper induced subgraph with minimum degree $k$.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Edge Threshold:** Define the critical edge count using binomial coefficients from Mathlib\n\n2. **Key Axioms:**\n   - sauermann_constant: Existence of cₖ with the right asymptotic behavior\n   - sauermann_theorem: The main result about induced subgraphs\n   - Historical bounds: efrs_original_bound and mns_bound\n\n3. **Main Theorem:** erdos_814 states that for every k ≥ 2, the desired constant exists\n\n4. **Special Cases:** Explicit analysis of k=2 and k=3 cases\n\n5. **Auxiliary Results:** Handshaking lemma and degree averaging arguments",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Edge Threshold Significance:** The formula (k-1)(n-k+2) + C(k-2,2) + 1 is tight - graphs with one fewer edge can avoid the conclusion",
      "**Progressive Improvement:** The savings went from √n (1990) to n/log(n) (2017) to cn (2019)",
      "**Constant Bounds:** Sauermann showed cₖ ≫ 1/k³, meaning the subgraph can be a constant fraction smaller",
      "**k=3 Origin:** The case k=3 (minimum degree 3 subgraphs) was the original Erdős-Hajnal problem",
      "**Extremal Constructions:** The tightness comes from explicit graph constructions that barely avoid the property"
