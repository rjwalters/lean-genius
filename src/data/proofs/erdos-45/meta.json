    "problemStatement": "Let $k\\geq 2$. Is there an integer $n_k$ such that, if $D=\\{ 11$ (simply taking $n_k$ to be the lowest common multiple of some interval $[1,C^k]$). Sawhney has observed that there is also a doubly exponential lower bound, and hence this bound is essentially sharp. Indeed, we must trivially have $\\sum_{d|n_k}1/d \\geq k$, or else there is a greedy colouring as a counterexample. Since $\\prod_{p}(1+1/p^2)$ is finite we must have $\\prod_{p|n_k}(1+1/p)\\gg k$. To achieve the minimal $\\prod_{p|n_k}p$ we take the product of primes up to $T$ where $\\prod_{p\\leq T}(1+1/p)\\gg k$; by Mertens theorems this implies $T\\geq C^{k}$ for some constant $C>1$, and hence $n_k\\geq \\prod_{p\\mid n_k}p\\geq \\exp(cC^k)$ for some $c>0$. The existence of such an $n_k$ is mentioned in problem B2 of Guy's collection [Gu04]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 September 2025.",
