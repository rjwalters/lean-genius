  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects Egyptian fractions (unit fraction representations) with Ramsey theory. Erdős asked whether highly composite numbers force monochromatic Egyptian representations under any coloring. Croot (2003) proved existence using probabilistic methods. Sawhney established tight doubly exponential bounds.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 2. Is there an integer n_k such that for D = {d : 1 < d < n_k, d | n_k}, any k-coloring of D contains a monochromatic subset D' ⊆ D with Σ_{d ∈ D'} 1/d = 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize proper divisors, k-colorings, monochromatic subsets, reciprocal sums, and the k-Egyptian property. Key results include Croot's existence theorem and Sawhney's doubly exponential bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The answer is YES - such n_k exists for all k ≥ 2 (Croot)",
      "Upper bound: n_k ≤ exp(C^k) using LCM of [1, C^k]",
      "Lower bound: n_k ≥ exp(cC^k) from divisor sum constraints",
      "Necessity: Σ_{d|n_k} 1/d ≥ k required, else greedy counterexample",
      "Mertens theorem: minimal prime product requires primes up to C^k"

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #45 on monochromatic Egyptian fractions. For any k-coloring of proper divisors of sufficiently large n_k, there exists a monochromatic subset with reciprocal sum 1. The bound is doubly exponential.",
