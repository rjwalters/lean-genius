  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The fact that a set with n elements has 2^n subsets is one of the most fundamental results in combinatorics. It appears in:\n\n- **Set Theory**: The power set P(S) has cardinality 2^|S|\n- **Probability Theory**: Sample spaces often have 2^n outcomes\n- **Computer Science**: n bits can represent 2^n states\n- **Algebra**: Boolean algebras have 2^n elements\n\nThe connection to binary representations makes this result essential for discrete mathematics and computer science.",
    "problemStatement": "**The Number of Subsets Theorem** (Wiedijk #52):\n\nFor any finite set $S$ with $n$ elements:\n$$|\\mathcal{P}(S)| = 2^n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{P}(S)$ denotes the power set (set of all subsets) of $S$.\n\nEquivalently, the number of ways to choose a subset of an n-element set is $2^n$.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses a **bijection with binary strings**:\n\n1. **Characteristic function**: Each subset $T \\subseteq S$ corresponds to a function $\\chi_T : S \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ where:\n   - $\\chi_T(x) = 1$ if $x \\in T$\n   - $\\chi_T(x) = 0$ if $x \\notin T$\n\n2. **Binary counting**: With $n$ elements, each making an independent binary choice (in or out), we get:\n   $$2 \\times 2 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 = 2^n$$\n\n3. **Mathlib formalization**: The theorem `Finset.card_powerset` directly provides this result for finite sets represented as `Finset`.",
