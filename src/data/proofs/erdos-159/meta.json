  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks whether the Ramsey number R(C₄, Kₙ) admits a power saving over the trivial n² bound. Szemerédi established the upper bound n²/(log n)² and Spencer proved the lower bound n^{3/2}/(log n)^{3/2}. The gap between exponents 3/2 and 2 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist c > 0 such that R(C₄, Kₙ) ≤ C · n^{2-c} for some constant C and all sufficiently large n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines C₄ containment and clique containment for simple graphs, axiomatises R(C₄, Kₙ) with its Ramsey threshold property, and states the known upper (Szemerédi) and lower (Spencer) bounds. The conjecture asks for a power saving in the exponent.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "R(C₄, Kₙ) asks: every graph on N vertices either contains C₄ or has independence number ≥ n",

      "Spencer's lower bound: R(C₄, Kₙ) ≫ n^{3/2}/(log n)^{3/2}",
      "The conjecture asks whether the exponent 2 can be reduced to 2-c for some c > 0"
