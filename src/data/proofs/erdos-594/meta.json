    "summary": "Erdős Problem #594 is SOLVED. Every graph with chromatic number ≥ ℵ₁ contains all sufficiently large odd cycles. This was proved by Erdős, Hajnal, and Shelah in 1974, improving their earlier result for ℵ₂. The threshold ℵ₁ is optimal - graphs with countable chromatic number need not have this property.",
