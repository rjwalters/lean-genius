  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Cantor posed the Continuum Hypothesis in 1878. Hilbert listed it as Problem #1 in 1900. Godel (1940) proved CH is consistent with ZFC using the constructible universe L. Cohen (1963) proved not-CH is consistent using forcing, earning the Fields Medal in 1966.",
    "problemStatement": "**Continuum Hypothesis**: There is no set with cardinality strictly between aleph_0 (countable infinity) and 2^(aleph_0) (the continuum).\n\nEquivalently: |R| = aleph_1.\n\n**Independence**: CH can neither be proved nor disproved from ZFC axioms.",
    "proofStrategy": "Model-theoretic: Godel's constructible universe L is a model of ZFC where CH holds. Cohen's forcing constructs a model where CH fails. Since both are consistent with ZFC, CH is independent.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The constructible universe L satisfies V = L and implies GCH",
      "Forcing allows construction of models with almost any cardinal arithmetic",
      "Independence means ZFC doesn't determine the size of the continuum",
      "New axioms (large cardinals, forcing axioms) may decide CH"

    "summary": "The independence of CH resolved Hilbert's first problem, but not in the way expected. It revealed fundamental limitations of ZFC and opened new research directions in set theory, including forcing axioms and the set-theoretic multiverse.",
