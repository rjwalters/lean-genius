    "historicalContext": "**Unit Distance Graphs and Independence**\n\nA unit distance graph has vertices as points in the plane and edges between points at distance exactly 1. This problem asks for the minimum possible independence number (largest set with no edges) across all n-point configurations.\n\n**The Density Approach**: Larman and Rogers (1972) connected this to the maximum density m₁ of measurable sets avoiding unit distances: f(n) ≥ m₁·n.\n\n**Key Results**:\n- Croft (1967): m₁ ≥ 0.22936, giving f(n) ≥ 0.22936n\n- Moser spindle: A 7-vertex graph with independence 2, giving f(n) ≤ (2/7)n\n- ACMVZ (2023): m₁ ≤ 0.247, showing density methods cannot achieve n/4\n\n**Connection to Hadwiger-Nelson**: Since ω·χ ≥ n for independence number ω and chromatic number χ, we have f(n) ≥ n/χ. With 5 ≤ χ ≤ 7, this gives f(n) ≥ n/7.",

    "proofStrategy": "**Approaches and Results**\n\n**Lower Bound (Density Method)**:\n1. Define m₁ = sup density of unit-distance-free measurable sets\n2. Larman-Rogers: f(n) ≥ m₁·n\n3. Croft: m₁ ≥ 0.22936\n4. Combined: f(n) ≥ 0.22936n\n\n**Upper Bound (Moser Spindle)**:\n1. The Moser spindle is a 7-vertex unit distance graph\n2. Its independence number is 2\n3. Copying this graph shows f(n) ≤ (2/7)n\n\n**The n/4 Barrier**:\n- ACMVZ (2023) proved m₁ ≤ 0.247\n- Since 0.247 < 0.25 = 1/4, density methods alone cannot prove f(n) ≥ n/4\n- New techniques would be needed to close the gap",
