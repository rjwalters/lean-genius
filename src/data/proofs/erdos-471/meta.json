  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Ulam and appears in Erdős-Graham (1980). The connection to Vinogradov's theorem was observed by Mrazović-Kovač and independently by Alon, resolving the problem affirmatively.",
    "problemStatement": "Given a finite set of primes Q₀, define a sequence Qᵢ where Qᵢ₊₁ consists of Qᵢ plus all primes that are sums of three distinct elements of Qᵢ. Is there an initial Q₀ such that the sequence grows without bound?\n\nAnswer: YES. Taking Q₀ = {primes ≤ N} for Vinogradov's constant N ensures all primes appear.",
    "proofStrategy": "By Vinogradov's theorem, every sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three primes. This means every large prime can be written as a sum of three smaller primes. Starting with Q₀ containing all primes up to Vinogradov's threshold ensures all larger primes are eventually added.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Vinogradov's theorem provides the key: large primes are sums of three smaller primes",
      "Taking Q₀ = {primes ≤ N} for large N ensures all primes eventually appear",
      "The sequence is monotone: Qᵢ ⊆ Qᵢ₊₁",
      "The special case Q₀ = {3,5,7,11} likely also works (computational question)"
