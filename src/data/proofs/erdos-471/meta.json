Is there some initial choice of $Q$ such that the $Q_i$ become arbitrarily large?\n\n\n\nA problem of Ulam. In particular, what about $Q=\\{3,5,7,11\\}$?\n\nMrazovi\\'{c} and Kova\\v{c}, and independently Alon, have observed that the existence of some valid choice of $Q$ follows easily from Vinogradov's theorem that every large odd integer is the sum of three distinct primes. In particular, there exists some $N$ such that every prime $>N$ is the sum of three distinct (smaller) primes. We may then take $Q_0$ to be the set of all primes $\\leq N$ (in which case all primes are eventually in some $Q_i$).\n\n\n\nBack to the problem",
