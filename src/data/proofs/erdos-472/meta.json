  "description": "Given an initial finite sequence of primes, extend by taking q_{n+1} as the smallest prime of the form q_n + q_i − 1. Does there exist a seed making the sequence infinite? Starting with 3, 5 gives 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, …",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem is due to Ulam and appears in Erdős–Graham (1980). It asks whether a greedy prime extension process, where each new prime is the smallest of the form q_n + q_i − 1, can produce an infinite sequence from some finite seed.",
    "problemStatement": "Given primes q₁ < … < qₘ, define q_{n+1} as the smallest prime of the form qₙ + qᵢ − 1 for i ≤ n. Does there exist a seed such that the sequence never terminates?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsCandidateNext for the extension rule, IsUlamPrimeSeq for the full sequence properties (seed matching, primality, monotonicity, minimality), and states the existence conjecture. The candidate seed [3, 5] is recorded.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The extension rule q_{n+1} = min prime of form q_n + q_i − 1 is a greedy process",
      "Starting with [3, 5] gives 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, … which appears infinite",
      "The sequence can terminate if no q_n + q_i − 1 is prime for any i",
      "Consecutive differences are at least 2 since all terms are prime"
