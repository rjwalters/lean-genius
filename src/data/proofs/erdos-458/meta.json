Is it true that, for all $k\\geq 1$,\\[[1,\\ldots,p_{k+1}-1]< p_k[1,\\ldots,p_k]?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham write this is 'almost certainly' true, but the proof is beyond our ability, for (at least) two reasons:\n{UL}\n{LI}Firstly, one has to rule out the possibility of many primes $q$ such that $p_k<q^2<p_{k+1}$. There should be at most one such $q$, which would follow from $p_{k+1}-p_k<p_k^{1/2}$, which is essentially the notorious Legendre's conjecture.{/LI}\n{LI} The small primes also cause trouble.{/LI}\n{/UL}\n\n\nBack to the problem",
