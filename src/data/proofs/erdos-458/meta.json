  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem explores the growth rate of the LCM function between consecutive primes. The LCM function lcm(1,...,n) is closely related to Chebyshev's ψ function, with log(lcm(1,...,n)) ~ n. The conjecture asks whether the growth between primes p_k and p_{k+1} is bounded by multiplication by p_k. Erdős and Graham described this as 'almost certainly' true, but noted the proof requires controlling prime gaps - essentially requiring Legendre's conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let [1,...,n] denote the least common multiple of {1,...,n}. Let p_k be the k-th prime. Is it true that for all k ≥ 1: lcm(1,...,p_{k+1}-1) < p_k · lcm(1,...,p_k)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define lcm_upto using Finset.lcm and the nth prime using Nat.nth. The main conjecture is expressed as a Prop. We verify small cases (k=1,2) computationally. The connection to Legendre's conjecture is formalized: we need to control primes q with p_k < q² < p_{k+1}.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Between consecutive primes, LCM only grows by composite factors (powers of smaller primes)",
      "The key obstacle is controlling primes q where p_k < q² < p_{k+1}",
      "Legendre's conjecture would imply at most one such q exists",
      "Chebyshev's bounds give log(lcm(1,...,n)) ~ n asymptotically"
