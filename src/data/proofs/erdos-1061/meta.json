    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #1061**\n\nThis problem appears as Problem B15 in Richard Guy's celebrated collection \"Unsolved Problems in Number Theory\" (2004 edition), attributed to Erdos.\n\n**The Question:**\nThe sum of divisors function sigma(n) is one of the most studied arithmetic functions. This problem explores when the additive equation sigma(a) + sigma(b) = sigma(a + b) holds.\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nUnlike many arithmetic functions, sigma is neither subadditive nor superadditive in general. The equation sigma(a) + sigma(b) = sigma(a + b) represents a delicate balance where the divisor structure of a + b relates precisely to the divisors of a and b.\n\n**Current Status:**\nThis problem remains OPEN. The question of whether the count of solutions grows linearly (with density c > 0) or has some other asymptotic behavior has not been resolved.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet S(x) count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) of positive integers with:\n1. a + b <= x\n2. sigma(a) + sigma(b) = sigma(a + b)\n\nwhere sigma is the sum of divisors function.\n\n**Question:** Is S(x) ~ c * x for some constant c > 0?\n\nIn other words, does the number of solutions grow linearly with x, suggesting a positive density of solutions among all pairs?\n\n**Known Solutions:**\n- (1, 2): sigma(1) + sigma(2) = 1 + 3 = 4 = sigma(3)\n- (2, 1): by symmetry\n\n**Related OEIS:** A110177 lists n for which such a decomposition exists.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Arithmetic Functions:** Define sigma(n) as the sum over n.divisors\n\n2. **Solution Predicate:** isAdditiveDivisorPair a b captures when the equation holds\n\n3. **Counting Function:** S(x) counts pairs via Finset.filter\n\n4. **Verified Examples:** Use native_decide to check small cases\n\n5. **Asymptotic Question:** Formalize hasLinearGrowth using Filter.Tendsto\n\n6. **Open Problem:** Mark erdos_1061_open as an axiom placeholder\n\nSince this is an open problem, we cannot prove the main conjecture, but we establish the framework and verify known facts.",
