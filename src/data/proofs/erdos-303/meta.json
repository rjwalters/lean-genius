  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem combines Ramsey theory with the arithmetic of unit fractions. The equation 1/a = 1/b + 1/c, also known as the 'Egyptian fraction equation' (since Egyptians preferred writing fractions as sums of unit fractions), has been studied since antiquity.\n\nErdős asked whether any finite colouring of the integers must contain three integers of the same colour satisfying this equation. This is a Ramsey-theoretic question: no matter how you partition the integers into finitely many classes, some class contains a 'pattern' (here, a unit fraction triple).\n\nBrown and Rödl proved the affirmative answer in 1991 using Ramsey-theoretic techniques. The related density version (Erdős #302) asks whether sets of positive density contain such solutions.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem (Erdős)**: Is it true that in any finite colouring of the integers there exists a monochromatic solution to\n$$\\frac{1}{a} = \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}$$\nwith distinct $a, b, c$?\n\n**Answer**: YES\n\n**Proved by**: Brown and Rödl (1991)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem and the solution:\n\n1. **Unit Fraction Equation**: Define UnitFractionEq a b c as (1/a : ℝ) = 1/b + 1/c. Prove equivalence with the algebraic form bc = a(b+c).\n\n2. **Verified Examples**: Prove concrete instances like 1/2 = 1/3 + 1/6 and 1/3 = 1/4 + 1/12 using norm_num.\n\n3. **Colourings**: Define IsFiniteColouring and Monochromatic. Prove two equivalent definitions of monochromaticity.\n\n4. **Main Theorem**: State Brown-Rödl's theorem as an axiom: in any finite colouring, a monochromatic valid solution exists.\n\n5. **Infinite Solutions**: Prove infinitely many solutions exist of the form 1/n = 1/(n+1) + 1/(n(n+1)).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Unit fraction identity**: 1/n = 1/(n+1) + 1/(n(n+1)) for all n ≥ 2, providing infinitely many solutions.",
      "**Algebraic reformulation**: 1/a = 1/b + 1/c is equivalent to bc = a(b+c), avoiding division.",
      "**Ramsey principle**: No matter how you colour ℤ with finitely many colours, some colour class contains a unit fraction triple.",
      "**Density connection**: The colouring version (this problem) is the Ramsey analog of the density version (Erdős #302)."
