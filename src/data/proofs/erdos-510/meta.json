  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Chowla posed the cosine problem, which Erdős publicized. It asks whether every large finite set of positive integers has a large negative cosine sum. Bourgain (1986) gave the first non-trivial bound, Ruzsa (2004) improved it, and Bedert (2025) achieved the first polynomial bound N^{1/7}.",
    "problemStatement": "For finite A ⊂ ℕ⁺ of size N, does there exist c > 0 and θ such that ∑_{n ∈ A} cos(nθ) < −c√N?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define the cosine sum function, state the √N conjecture, record the best known N^{1/7} bound (Bedert 2025), and prove optimality via Sidon sets.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The conjectured bound √N is optimal: Sidon difference sets achieve it",
      "Bedert (2025) proved the first polynomial bound: −cN^{1/7}",
      "The gap between N^{1/7} and N^{1/2} remains open",
      "The problem connects harmonic analysis with additive combinatorics",
      "Appears as Problem 81 on Green's open problems list"

  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Chowla's cosine problem asks whether every finite set of N positive integers has a cosine sum below −c√N. The best known bound is −cN^{1/7} (Bedert 2025), far from the conjectured √N. The problem sits at the intersection of harmonic analysis and additive combinatorics.",
    "implications": "Resolving Chowla's conjecture would strengthen understanding of exponential sum bounds and have applications to discrepancy theory, Diophantine approximation, and the distribution of arithmetic sequences.",
