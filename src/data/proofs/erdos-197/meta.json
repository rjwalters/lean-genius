    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #197**\n\nThis problem originates from Erdős and Graham's foundational work on arithmetic progressions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, documented in [ErGr79] and [ErGr80].\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős and Graham posed the original question about partitioning ℕ\n- The three-set version was proved solvable by Erdős-Graham\n- The two-set version remains open and cannot be resolved by finite computation\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nA monotone 3-term arithmetic progression (3-AP) in a sequence f is a triple (i, j, k) with i < j < k where f(i), f(j), f(k) form an arithmetic progression. The question asks whether ℕ can be split into two parts, each rearrangeable to avoid such patterns.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nCan ℕ be partitioned into two sets, each of which can be permuted to avoid monotone 3-term arithmetic progressions?\n\n**Formal Statement:**\nDoes there exist A, B ⊆ ℕ with A ∩ B = ∅ and A ∪ B = ℕ such that both A and B admit enumerations f: ℕ → A and g: ℕ → B with no i < j < k satisfying f(i) + f(k) = 2f(j) or g(i) + g(k) = 2g(j)?\n\n**Answer: UNKNOWN**\n\nThe three-set version is solvable (Erdős-Graham), indicating a threshold phenomenon.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Arithmetic Progressions:** Define isArithmeticProgression and monotone 3-AP detection\n\n2. **Sequence Properties:** Define hasMonotone3AP and avoids3AP predicates\n\n3. **Set Permutations:** Define when a set can be permuted to avoid 3-APs\n\n4. **Partition Definitions:** isTwoPartition and isThreePartition\n\n5. **Main Results:**\n   - Axiomatize the open conjecture\n   - Axiomatize Erdős-Graham's three-set result\n   - Prove supporting properties\n\n6. **Examples:** Powers of 2, identity sequence, Stanley sequence",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #197 asks whether ℕ can be partitioned into two sets, each permutable to avoid monotone 3-term arithmetic progressions. The answer is UNKNOWN. We do know that three sets suffice (Erdős-Graham) and that the problem cannot be resolved by finite computation. The formalization captures the open conjecture as an axiom representing the disjunction of the two possible answers.",
