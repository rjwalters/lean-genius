  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1961 about the density regularity of multiples of a finite set. The 1961 version had a likely typo (a ∤ n instead of a | n), corrected in 1966. The constant 2 is shown to be optimal by the singleton example A = {a} with n = 2a-1, m = 2a.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be a finite set of integers ≥ 2 and B = {n ≥ 1 : a | n for some a ∈ A}. Is |B ∩ [1,m]|/m < 2·|B ∩ [1,n]|/n for all m > n ≥ max(A)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the multiples set B(A), the counting function and density ratio, and states the conjecture as a universal inequality. The optimality of constant 2 is axiomatised via the singleton example.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "B(A) is the set of positive multiples of elements of A",
      "The density ratio |B ∩ [1,N]|/N stabilises as N grows",
      "The constant 2 is optimal: A = {a}, n = 2a-1, m = 2a gives ratio approaching 2",
      "The 1961 version had a ∤ n (typo), corrected to a | n in 1966"
