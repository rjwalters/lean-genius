    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #819 was studied by Erdős and Freud in 1991. They established that for sets A ⊆ [1,N] of size √N, the maximum size of the restricted sumset (A+A) ∩ [1,N] lies between (3/8 - o(1))N and (1/2 + o(1))N. The problem is closely connected to quasi-Sidon sets (Problem #840).",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(N) be maximal such that there exists A ⊆ {1,...,N} with |A| = ⌊√N⌋ such that |(A+A) ∩ [1,N]| = f(N). Estimate f(N).\n\nErdős and Freud proved: (3/8 - o(1))N ≤ f(N) ≤ (1/2 + o(1))N",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the key definitions (sumsets, restricted sumsets, admissible sets) and state the Erdős-Freud bounds as axioms. The proof explores the gap between 0.375N and 0.5N that remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "√N is a critical threshold - sets of this size have non-trivial sumset structure",
      "The lower bound 3N/8 is achieved by carefully constructed sets avoiding too much additive structure",
      "The upper bound N/2 comes from the constraint that sums must land in [1,N]",
      "Connection to quasi-Sidon sets provides structural insight"
