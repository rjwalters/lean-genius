    "historicalContext": "**The Erdős-Simonovits Conjecture**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős and Simonovits (1984) as a fundamental question connecting extremal graph theory with rational number theory.\n\n**The extremal number ex(n;G):** What is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that contains no copy of G? For bipartite G, ex(n;G) = o(n²), making precise growth rates meaningful.\n\n**Turán Exponents:** A rational α ∈ [1,2) is a Turán exponent if some bipartite G has ex(n;G) ≍ n^α. The conjecture asks: is every such α achievable?\n\n**Major Progress:**\n- Bukh-Conlon (2018): Solved the finite family variant\n- Conlon-Janzer (2022): Covered exponents near 2\n- Jiang-Qiu (2023): Made progress on low exponents\n\n**Current Status:** OPEN. Exponents close to 1 remain the hardest cases.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nShow that for any rational $\\alpha \\in [1,2)$ there exists a bipartite graph $G$ such that $\\text{ex}(n;G) \\asymp n^\\alpha$.\n\n**Notation:**\n- $\\text{ex}(n;G)$: maximum edges in n-vertex G-free graph\n- $\\asymp$: asymptotic equivalence (both $O$ and $\\Omega$)\n- Turán exponent: a rational $\\alpha$ achievable this way\n\n**Known Results:**\n- Exponents near 2: well-covered by Conlon-Janzer\n- Specific families: $3/2 - 1/(2s)$, $4/3 - 1/(3s)$, $1 + a/b$ (with conditions)\n- Finite families: Bukh-Conlon proved every $\\alpha$ works for graph families",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Foundations:**\n   - Graph structure with adjacency relation\n   - IsBipartite: vertex 2-partition property\n   - ContainsCopy, IsFree: subgraph relations\n   - edgeCount: cardinality of edge set\n\n2. **Extremal Theory:**\n   - extremalNumber: ex(n;G) definition\n   - Asymptotic notation: AsymptoticEquiv (≍), IsBigO, IsBigOmega\n\n3. **Turán Exponents:**\n   - IsTuranExponent: rational α with witness bipartite G\n   - erdos_571_conjecture: all rationals in [1,2) are Turán exponents\n\n4. **Known Results (Axiomatized):**\n   - Conlon-Janzer-Lee, Jiang-Qiu, Jiang-Ma-Yepremyan families\n   - Bukh-Conlon finite family theorem\n   - Kővári-Sós-Turán upper bounds\n\n5. **Classical Examples:**\n   - Paths: ex(n; P_k) = Θ(n)\n   - Even cycles: ex(n; C_{2k}) related to 1 + 1/k",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Interval [1,2):** For bipartite G, ex(n;G) is between linear and quadratic - all exponents must lie in [1,2)",
      "**Finite Family Version:** Bukh-Conlon (2018) proved every rational works for families, but single graphs remain open",
      "**Accumulation Near 2:** Known constructions naturally produce exponents clustering near 2",
      "**Hard Cases Near 1:** Exponents like 1.01 require fundamentally new techniques",
      "**Jiang-Qiu Progress:** 1 + a/b with b > a² covers infinitely many low exponents",
      "**Conlon-Janzer Coverage:** Exponents ≥ 7/4 are well-understood via 2 - a/b constructions"
