  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Simonovits as a fundamental question connecting extremal graph theory with rational number theory. The extremal number ex(n;G) asks: what is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that contains no copy of G? For bipartite graphs, ex(n;G) is known to be o(n²) but the exact growth rates achievable form a rich structure.",
    "problemStatement": "Show that for any rational α ∈ [1,2) there exists a bipartite graph G such that ex(n;G) ≍ n^α. Here ≍ means asymptotic equivalence: both O(n^α) and Ω(n^α). A rational α for which this holds is called a Turán exponent.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization captures: (1) Basic graph definitions including bipartiteness and extremal numbers. (2) The definition of Turán exponent and the main conjecture. (3) Extensive known families of Turán exponents from recent research. (4) The Bukh-Conlon theorem for finite families. (5) Classical results like Kővári-Sós-Turán. (6) Specific examples including paths and even cycles.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Turán exponents form a subset of [1,2) ∩ ℚ; the conjecture asks if this subset is all of [1,2) ∩ ℚ",
      "Bukh-Conlon (2018) proved the weaker version: every rational is achievable for a FINITE FAMILY of bipartite graphs",
      "Known Turán exponents accumulate near 2: results like Conlon-Janzer cover exponents ≥ 7/4 well",
      "The hardest cases are exponents close to 1, where constructions are scarce",
      "Recent progress by Jiang-Qiu (2023) gives exponents 1 + a/b with b > a², partially addressing low exponents"
