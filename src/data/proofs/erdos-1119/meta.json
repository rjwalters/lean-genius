Let $\\{f_\\alpha\\}$ be a family of entire functions such that, for every $z_0\\in \\mathbb{C}$, there are at most $\\mathfrak{m}$ distinct values of $f_\\alpha(z_0)$. Must $\\{f_\\alpha\\}$ have cardinality at most $\\mathfrak{m}$?\n\n\n\nThis is Problem 2.46 in \\cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64g} proved (answering a question of Wetzel) that if there are only countably many distinct values for each $f_\\alpha(z_0)$ then, if $\\mathfrak{c}>\\aleph_1$, the family $\\{f_\\alpha\\}$ is itself countable, and also showed this is false if $\\mathfrak{c}=\\aleph_1$.\n\nIn \\cite{Ha74} it is written that it is 'easy to see' the answer is yes if $\\mathfrak{m}^+<\\mathfrak{c}$, and also that it is possible that the question is undecidable.\n\nIndeed, it has been shown that this is undecidable if $\\mathfrak{m}^+=\\mathfrak{c}$: Kumar and Shelah \\cite{KuSh17} have shown that there is a model in which $\\mathfrak{c}=\\aleph_2$ such that the answer is yes (with $\\mathfrak{m}=\\aleph_1$), while Schilhan and Weinert \\cite{ScWe24} have shown the answer can be no, in a different model with $\\mathfrak{c}=\\aleph_2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er64g] Erd\\H{o}s, P., An interpolation problem associated with the continuum\nhypothesis.
