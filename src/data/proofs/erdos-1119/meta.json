  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This generalizes Wetzel's 1963 problem, which Erdős solved in 1964. The original problem asked about countable values (𝔪 = ℵ₀), and Erdős showed the answer depends on the Continuum Hypothesis. This problem extends to intermediate cardinals 𝔪 with ℵ₀ < 𝔪 < 𝔠. Hayman (1974) noted the easy case 𝔪⁺ < 𝔠. Kumar-Shelah (2017) and Schilhan-Weinert (2024) showed the case 𝔪⁺ = 𝔠 is undecidable.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 𝔪 be an infinite cardinal with ℵ₀ < 𝔪 < 𝔠 = 2^{ℵ₀}. Let {f_α} be a family of entire functions such that, for every z₀ ∈ ℂ, there are at most 𝔪 distinct values of f_α(z₀). Must {f_α} have cardinality at most 𝔪?",
    "proofStrategy": "The answer splits into two cases based on whether 𝔪⁺ < 𝔠 or 𝔪⁺ = 𝔠. In the first case, the answer is YES (provable in ZFC). In the second case, the problem is undecidable in ZFC: Kumar-Shelah constructed a model where YES holds, while Schilhan-Weinert constructed a model where NO holds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The problem generalizes Wetzel's question from ℵ₀ to arbitrary intermediate cardinals 𝔪",
      "If 𝔪⁺ < 𝔠, the answer is YES—the family size is bounded by the local multiplicity",
      "If 𝔪⁺ = 𝔠 (e.g., 𝔪 = ℵ₁, 𝔠 = ℵ₂), the answer is independent of ZFC",
      "Kumar-Shelah (2017) showed YES is consistent with ZFC in this case",
      "Schilhan-Weinert (2024) showed NO is also consistent with ZFC",
      "The identity theorem for entire functions is key: distinct entire functions agree on at most countably many points"
