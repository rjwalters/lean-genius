    "historicalContext": "**Ramsey Size Linearity**\n\nThe Ramsey number R(G,H) is the minimum n such that any 2-coloring of K_n contains a red copy of G or a blue copy of H. This problem studies graphs G for which R(G,H) grows linearly in the size of H.\n\n**The Definition**: A graph G is *Ramsey size linear* if R(G,H) = O(m) for all graphs H with m edges and no isolated vertices. Intuitively, the 'difficulty' of avoiding G doesn't compound with the size of H.\n\n**The Mystery of K₄**: The complete graph K₄ is known to NOT be Ramsey size linear, but every proper subgraph of K₄ (triangles, paths, matchings) IS Ramsey size linear. This makes K₄ 'minimally non-Ramsey-size-linear'.\n\n**The Question**: Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1993) asked whether K₄ is the only such graph, or if infinitely many exist.\n\n**Resolution**: Wigderson's 2024 breakthrough proved infinitely many such graphs exist, though the proof is non-constructive. K₄ remains the only explicit example!",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nWe say G is *Ramsey size linear* if R(G,H) ≪ m for all graphs H with m edges and no isolated vertices.\n\nAre there infinitely many graphs G which are NOT Ramsey size linear but such that all proper subgraphs of G ARE Ramsey size linear?\n\n**Terminology**: Such graphs are called *minimally non-Ramsey-size-linear* or *minimally Ramsey size superlinear*.\n\n**Known Examples**: Only K₄ (the complete graph on 4 vertices) is explicitly known.\n\n**Answer**: YES, infinitely many exist (Wigderson 2024), but constructing explicit examples beyond K₄ remains open.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach (Wigderson 2024)**\n\nWigderson's non-constructive proof uses probabilistic and extremal methods:\n\n1. **Hereditary Property Analysis**: Study the class of Ramsey size linear graphs and its closure properties under taking subgraphs.\n\n2. **Forbidden Subgraph Characterization**: Show that minimally non-Ramsey-size-linear graphs form an infinite antichain in the subgraph ordering.\n\n3. **Probabilistic Existence**: Use probabilistic arguments to show that avoiding all minimal obstructions is impossible in certain graph families.\n\n4. **Counting Arguments**: Derive a contradiction from assuming only finitely many minimal examples exist.\n\n**Key Difficulty**: The proof establishes existence without providing a construction. Finding the 'next' example after K₄ requires new techniques.",
