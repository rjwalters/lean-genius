  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Edwards (1973) proved that every graph with m edges contains a bipartite subgraph with at least m/2 + (√(8m+1) - 1)/8 edges, and that this is tight for complete graphs. Erdős, Kohayakawa, and Gyárfás asked whether the excess f(m) beyond this bound tends to infinity along some subsequence. Alon (1996) solved this affirmatively.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(m) be the maximum value such that every graph with m edges contains a bipartite subgraph with at least m/2 + (√(8m+1) - 1)/8 + f(m) edges. Is there an infinite sequence mᵢ with f(mᵢ) → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize maxBipartiteEdges and excessF, define edwardsBound as the Edwards formula. ErdosProblem127 asks for a subsequence with divergent excess. Alon's lower bound f(n²/2) ≫ √n and upper bound f(m) ≪ m^{1/4} are both axiomatized. Complete graph tightness f(C(n,2)) = 0 is included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Edwards' bound m/2 + (√(8m+1)-1)/8 is the baseline for bipartite subgraph guarantees",
      "Complete graphs K_n show tightness: f(C(n,2)) = 0",
      "Alon proved f(n²/2) ≫ n^{1/2}, answering the conjecture affirmatively",
      "The upper bound f(m) ≪ m^{1/4} constrains how fast f can grow"
