Is there some set $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ of density $>1-\\epsilon$ such that $a_1\\cdots a_r=b_1\\cdots b_s$ with $a_i,b_j\\in A$ can only hold when $r=s$?\n\nSimilarly, can one always find a set $A\\subset\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ with this property of size $\\geq (1-o(1))N$?\n\n\n\nAn example of such a set with density $1/4$ is given by the integers $\\equiv 2\\pmod{4}$.\n\nSelfridge constructed such a set with density $1/e-\\epsilon$ for any $\\epsilon>0$: let $p_1<\\cdots<p_k$ be a sequence of large consecutive primes such that\\[\\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{1}{p_i}<1<\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1}\\frac{1}{p_i},\\]and let $A$ be those integers divisible by exactly one of $p_1,\\ldots,p_k$.\n\nFor the second question the set of integers with a prime factor $>N^{1/2}$ give an example of a set with size $\\geq (\\log 2)N$. Erd\\H{o}s could improve this constant slightly.\n\nIn \\cite{Er65} Erd\\H{o}s reports that Ruzsa proved the maximal size of such an $A$ is $\\leq (1-c)N$ for some constant $c>0$ for large $N$, but the proof 'is not yet published'. As far as I know, no such proof was ever published.\n\nSee also [421] and [795].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er65] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Extremal problems in number theory. Proc. Sympos.
