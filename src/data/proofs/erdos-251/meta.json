    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #251 asks a deceptively simple question: is the sum Σ pₙ/2ⁿ irrational? Here pₙ denotes the nth prime: p₁ = 2, p₂ = 3, p₃ = 5, and so on.\n\nThe sum converges absolutely (since pₙ ~ n ln n by the prime number theorem and Σ n ln n / 2ⁿ converges). Its decimal expansion begins 3.59686... and is catalogued as OEIS A098990.\n\nErdős himself proved the related result that Σ pₙᵏ/n! is irrational for all k ≥ 1 (the factorial denominators make the problem tractable). He conjectured that Σ pₙᵏ/2ⁿ is also irrational for all k ≥ 1, which includes Problem #251 as the case k = 1.\n\nErdős also formulated a more general conjecture: if gₙ ≥ 2 for all n and gₙ = o(pₙ), then Σ pₙ/(g₁·g₂·...·gₙ) is irrational.",
    "problemStatement": "Is the sum $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{p_n}{2^n}$ irrational, where $p_n$ is the $n$th prime?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**The Sum**: $\\frac{2}{2} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{5}{8} + \\frac{7}{16} + \\frac{11}{32} + \\cdots \\approx 3.59686...$\n\n**Related Solved Result**: Erdős proved $\\sum \\frac{p_n^k}{n!}$ is irrational for all $k \\geq 1$.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem and related results:\n\n1. **Define the sum**: Using Mathlib's `Nat.nth Nat.Prime` to enumerate primes\n2. **State convergence**: The sum converges by comparison with Σ n ln n / 2ⁿ (axiom)\n3. **State the conjecture**: `erdos_251_conjecture := Irrational erdosSum`\n4. **State related results**: Erdős's factorial irrationality theorem as an axiom\n5. **Verify partial sums**: Prove first 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 terms sum to 1, 7/4, 19/8, 45/16, 101/32\n\nThe actual irrationality proof is unknown and cannot be formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Why this is hard**: Proving irrationality of explicit series is notoriously difficult. Even whether e + π is irrational remains open! The irregularity of the prime sequence adds further complexity.",
      "**The OEIS constant**: The sum ≈ 3.59686... (OEIS A098990). It's well-defined, but its arithmetic nature is unknown.",
      "**Factorial vs exponential**: Erdős could prove Σ pₙᵏ/n! irrational because n! grows much faster than 2ⁿ, allowing tail analysis. The 2ⁿ case is harder.",
      "**General conjecture**: Erdős conjectured that for any slowly-growing sequence gₙ ≥ 2 with gₙ = o(pₙ), the sum Σ pₙ/(g₁·...·gₙ) is irrational.",
      "**Computational evidence**: The first 5 terms sum to 101/32 ≈ 3.15625, already within 0.5 of the limit."
