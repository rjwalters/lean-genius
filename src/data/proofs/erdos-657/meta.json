In \\cite{Er97e} he does not mention Davis, but says this problem was investigated by himself, F\\\"{u}redi, Ruzsa, and Pach.\n\nIn \\cite{Er73} Erd\\H{o}s says it is not even known in $\\mathbb{R}$ whether $f(n)\\to \\infty$. Sarosh Adenwalla has observed that this is equivalent to minimising the number of distinct differences in a set $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ of size $n$ without three-term arithmetic progressions. Dumitrescu \\cite{Du08} proved that, in these terms,\\[(\\log n)^c \\leq f(n) \\leq 2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nHunter observed in the comments that a result of Ruzsa coupled with standard tools of additive combinatorics (with details given by Alfaiz and Tang) allow recent progress on the size of subsets without three-term arithmetic progression (see \\cite{BlSi23} which improves slightly on the bounds due to Kelley and Meka \\cite{KeMe23}) yield\\[2^{c(\\log n)^{1/9}}\\leq f(n)\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nStraus has observed that if $2^k\\geq n$ then there exist $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ which contain no isosceles triangle and determine at most $n-1$ distances.\n\nSee also [135].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BlSi23] T.
