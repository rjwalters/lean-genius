    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #657 (Isosceles-Free Point Sets and Distinct Distances)**\n\n**Origin:**\nErdős and Davies formulated this problem in [Er73] (1973), asking about the relationship between avoiding isosceles triangles and forcing many distinct distances. The problem was later investigated by Erdős, Füredi, Ruzsa, and Pach.\n\n**The Setup:**\nA point set A ⊂ ℝ² is *isosceles-free* if every triple of points determines three distinct distances. The question is whether such sets must have many distances: at least f(n)·n for some f(n) → ∞.\n\n**Key Breakthrough:**\nDumitrescu (2008) established: (log n)^c ≤ f(n) ≤ 2^{O(√log n)}. The lower bound shows f(n) → ∞ (answering Erdős's question affirmatively), while the upper bound gives a construction.\n\n**Recent Progress:**\nKelley-Meka (2023) and Bloom-Sisask improved the lower bound to 2^{c(log n)^{1/9}} using advances in 3-term arithmetic progression bounds.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Solved)**\n\nIf A ⊂ ℝ² is a set of n points such that every subset of 3 points determines 3 distinct distances (i.e., A has no isosceles triangles), then A must determine at least f(n)·n distinct distances, for some f(n) → ∞?\n\n**Answer: YES** (f(n) → ∞ is confirmed)\n\n**Current Bounds:**\n- Lower: 2^{c(log n)^{1/9}} ≤ f(n) (Kelley-Meka/Bloom-Sisask 2023)\n- Upper: f(n) ≤ 2^{O(√log n)} (Dumitrescu 2008)\n\nThe exact growth rate of f(n) remains unknown.",
