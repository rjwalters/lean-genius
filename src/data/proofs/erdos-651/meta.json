    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #651**\n\nThis problem concerns the Ramsey-type function f_k(n), which measures how many points in general position in k-dimensional space are needed to guarantee n points in convex position.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős-Szekeres (1935): Introduced f_2(n) for the plane, proving exponential bounds\n- Erdős [Er97e]: Asked whether exponential growth persists in all dimensions\n- Pohoata-Zakharov (2022): Disproved the conjecture by showing f_3(n) ≤ 2^{o(n)}\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nThe planar case (k=2) is the famous Erdős-Klein-Szekeres problem (Erdős #107), where the exact value of f_2(n) remains open. For k=2, exponential growth is guaranteed: f_2(n) ≥ 2^{n-2} + 1. The question asked whether this exponential behavior extends to higher dimensions.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet f_k(n) denote the smallest integer such that any f_k(n) points in general position in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ contain n points determining a convex polyhedron.\n\nIs it true that $f_k(n) > (1 + c_k)^n$ for some constant $c_k > 0$?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\nPohoata and Zakharov (2022) proved that $f_3(n) \\leq 2^{o(n)}$, showing that the exponential lower bound fails already in 3 dimensions. By monotonicity ($f_k(n) \\leq f_3(n)$ for $k \\geq 3$), it fails for all $k \\geq 3$.\n\nRemarkably, the conjecture IS true for k=2 (the plane).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Abstract Function:** Define convexPositionFn as an axiomatized function representing f_k(n)\n\n2. **Growth Definitions:**\n   - hasExponentialLowerBound: ∃ c > 0 such that f_k(n) > (1+c)^n\n   - hasSubexponentialGrowth: ∀ ε > 0, eventually f(n) < (1+ε)^n\n\n3. **Key Axioms:**\n   - pohoata_zakharov_2022: f_3 has subexponential growth\n   - exponential_holds_k2: f_2 has exponential growth (Erdős-Szekeres)\n   - Monotonicity in k: f_{k+1}(n) ≤ f_k(n)\n\n4. **Main Theorem:** Derive the disproof from the axioms",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #651 asked whether the convex position function f_k(n) grows exponentially in all dimensions k ≥ 2. Pohoata and Zakharov (2022) showed the answer is NO: f_3(n) ≤ 2^{o(n)}, which is subexponential. By monotonicity, this extends to all k ≥ 3. However, the conjecture IS true for k = 2, where Erdős-Szekeres shows f_2(n) ≥ 2^{n-2} + 1.",
