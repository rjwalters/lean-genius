It is clear that, for the set of odd numbers in $\\{1,\\ldots,2N\\}$, no such $b_i$ exist, whence $g_k(N)\\geq 0$ always. Choi, Erd\\H{o}s, and Szemer\\'{e}di proved that $g_3(N)=2$ and $g_4(N) \\ll 1$. van Doorn has shown that $g_4(N)\\leq 2032$.\n\nChoi, Erd\\H{o}s, and Szemer\\'{e}di also proved that\\[g_5(N)\\asymp \\log N\\]and\\[g_6(N)\\asymp N^{1/2}.\\]In general they proved that\\[g_k(N) \\ll_k N^{1-2^{-k}}\\]and for every $\\epsilon>0$ if $k$ is sufficiently large then\\[g_k(N) > N^{1-\\epsilon}.\\]As an example, taking $A$ to be the set of all odd integers and the powers of $2$ shows that $g_5(N)\\gg \\log N$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
