  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Chinese Remainder Theorem first appeared in the Sunzi Suanjing ('The Mathematical Classic of Sun Zi'), a Chinese treatise from the 3rd-5th century CE. The classic problem asks:\n\n'Find a number that leaves remainder 2 when divided by 3, remainder 3 when divided by 5, and remainder 2 when divided by 7.'\n\nThe answer is 23, unique modulo 105 = 3 * 5 * 7. The theorem was rediscovered independently by Euler and fully developed by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801).",
    "problemStatement": "**Chinese Remainder Theorem**: Given pairwise coprime moduli m1, m2, ..., mk and any integers a1, a2, ..., ak, there exists a unique x (mod m1*m2*...*mk) such that:\n\nx = a1 (mod m1)\nx = a2 (mod m2)\n...\nx = ak (mod mk)\n\n**Constructive Formula**: For two moduli m, n with gcd(m,n) = 1, find u, v with mu + nv = 1 (Bezout). Then:\nx = a*n*v + b*m*u\nsatisfies x = a (mod m) and x = b (mod n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses Mathlib's `Nat.chineseRemainder` for the core result.\n\n**Existence**: Bezout's identity gives coefficients u, v with mu + nv = 1. The solution x = a*n*v + b*m*u works because:\n- x = a*n*v + b*m*u = a*(1-mu) + b*m*u = a + m*(bu-au) = a (mod m)\n- Similarly x = b (mod n)\n\n**Uniqueness**: If x1 = x2 = a (mod m) and x1 = x2 = b (mod n), then m | (x1-x2) and n | (x1-x2). Since gcd(m,n)=1, we have m*n | (x1-x2).",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization provides a complete treatment of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, from the abstract existence/uniqueness results to concrete computational examples. The Sunzi problem (23 mod 105) serves as the iconic example.\n\nThe constructive approach using Bezout coefficients gives explicit formulas for solutions, making the theorem practical for computation. The extension to three moduli demonstrates the iterative nature of the algorithm.",
    "implications": "**Applications in Cryptography**\n\nCRT is fundamental to modern cryptography:\n\n1. **RSA**: CRT-based decryption is ~4x faster than naive exponentiation\n2. **Secret Sharing**: Shamir's scheme uses polynomial interpolation over finite fields\n\n**Residue Number Systems**\n\nAny x < m1*m2*...*mk is uniquely determined by its residues (x mod m1, x mod m2, ...). This allows:\n- Parallel arithmetic: add/multiply componentwise\n- Fault tolerance: losing one residue can be recovered\n\n**Calendar Calculations**\n\nFinding when multiple cycles align (e.g., days of week + phases of moon + ...) is a CRT problem.",
