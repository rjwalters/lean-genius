Is it true that\\[F(n)=(c+o(1))\\log\\log\\log n\\]for some constant $c$? Is the first pattern which fails to appear always\\[\\phi(m+1)>\\phi(m+2)>\\cdots \\phi(m+k)?\\]Is it true that 'natural' ordering which mimics what happens to $\\phi(1),\\ldots,\\phi(k)$ is the most likely to appear?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er36b} proved that\\[F(n)\\asymp \\log\\log\\log n,\\]and similarly if we replace $\\phi$ with $\\sigma$ or $\\tau$ or $\\nu$ or any 'decent' additive or multiplicative function.\n\nWeisenberg has observed that the same questions could be asked for ordering patterns which allow equality (indeed, the final problem only makes sense if we allow equality).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er36b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On a problem of Chowla and some related problems.
