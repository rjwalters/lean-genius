  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the growth rate of the diagonal Ramsey numbers R(n), fundamental objects in combinatorics. Ramsey proved their existence in 1930, Erdős-Szekeres established upper bounds in 1935, and Erdős introduced probabilistic lower bounds in 1947. Despite nearly a century of study, exact growth rates remain mysterious. Even R(5) is unknown (43 ≤ R(5) ≤ 48). This problem asks whether consecutive Ramsey numbers grow by at least a constant ratio or by at least quadratic differences.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that R(n+1)/R(n) ≥ 1 + c for some constant c > 0 and all large n? Is it true that R(n+1) - R(n) ≫ n²?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the Ramsey function R(n), states the two main conjectures, and presents the known results. The BEFS theorem gives a linear lower bound on differences. The connection to Problem #165 shows that two-step differences are almost quadratic. The gap between one-step and two-step bounds is highlighted.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The linear bound R(n+1) - R(n) ≥ 4n - 8 is best known",
      "Two-step differences R(n+2) - R(n) ≫ n^{2-o(1)} are much larger",
      "Cannot be resolved by finite computation - needs asymptotic arguments",
      "Ramsey numbers have mysterious growth between 2^{n/2} and 4^n",
