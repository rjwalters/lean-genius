Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er76d} believed the answer to this question is no, and in fact if $n_k$ is the $k$th powerful number then\\[n_{k+2}-n_k > n_k^c\\]for some constant $c>0$. The abc conjecture implies there are only finitely many such triples.\n\nIt is trivial that there are no quadruples of consecutive powerful numbers since one must be $2\\pmod{4}$.\n\nChan \\cite{Ch25} has shown there are no triples $n-1,n,n+1$ of powerful numbers with $n$ a cube.\n\nBy OEIS A060355 there are no such $n$ for $n<10^{22}$.\n\nSee also [137], [365], and [938].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ch25] Chan, Tsz Ho, A note on three consecutive powerful numbers.
