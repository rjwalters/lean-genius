  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Powerful numbers were introduced by Solomon W. Golomb in 1970. A positive integer n is powerful if for every prime p dividing n, we also have p² | n. Equivalently, n can be written as a²b³ for some integers a, b ≥ 1. The sequence begins 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, ...\n\nIn 1976, Erdős asked Mahler whether infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers exist. Mahler immediately observed that yes—the Pell equation x² = 8y² + 1 has infinitely many solutions, and each gives a pair: (8, 9), (288, 289), (9800, 9801), etc. This is because 8y² is always powerful (divisible by 2³·y²) and x² = 8y² + 1 makes x² powerful too.\n\nErdős then asked the natural follow-up: can there be three consecutive powerful numbers? He believed no, and conjectured more strongly that if nₖ is the k-th powerful number, then nₖ₊₂ - nₖ > nₖᶜ for some c > 0. The abc conjecture would imply only finitely many triples exist.\n\nChan (2025) proved a partial result: no triple n-1, n, n+1 exists when n is a perfect cube. Computational searches have verified no triple exists for n < 10²².",
    "problemStatement": "A positive integer $n$ is **powerful** if for every prime $p$ dividing $n$, we have $p^2 \\mid n$.\n\n**Question**: Do there exist three consecutive powerful numbers $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$?\n\n**Status**: OPEN (conjectured to be NO)\n\n**Known Results**:\n- Pairs (n, n+1) exist infinitely often (Mahler, via Pell equation)\n- Quadruples are impossible (one of four consecutive integers is ≡ 2 (mod 4))\n- No triple found for $n < 10^{22}$ (OEIS A060355)\n- abc conjecture implies finitely many triples\n- No triple with middle term a cube (Chan 2025)",
    "proofStrategy": "Our formalization proves the quadruple impossibility constructively and states the triple conjecture as an axiom.\n\n**For the quadruple result**: Among any four consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2, n+3, exactly one is congruent to 2 (mod 4). But a number ≡ 2 (mod 4) cannot be powerful: it is divisible by 2 but not by 4 = 2². This contradiction rules out all quadruples.\n\n**For the triple conjecture**: Since this remains open, we state it as an axiom with full historical context. We also include Chan's 2025 partial result and Erdős's stronger gap conjecture.\n\n**Examples**: We verify 1, 4, 8, 9 are powerful using interval_cases to check all primes up to the value, combined with decidability of divisibility and primality.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Powerful numbers**: If every prime dividing n also has its square divide n, then n is powerful. The characterization n = a²b³ connects to the structure of prime factorizations.",
      "**Mod 4 obstruction**: Numbers ≡ 2 (mod 4) are exactly divisible by 2 but not 4, so they can never be powerful. This simple observation kills the quadruple case immediately.",
      "**Pell equation connection**: The identity 8y² + 1 = x² from Pell theory gives infinitely many consecutive pairs, since 8y² = 2³·y² is powerful when y is powerful.",
      "**abc conjecture implications**: If the abc conjecture holds, then for coprime a + b = c, we have c < K·rad(abc)^{1+ε}. Applied to powerful triples, this limits how close they can be.",
      "**The gap problem**: Erdős believed gaps between powerful numbers grow polynomially—if true, this is much stronger than just ruling out triples."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalized Erdős Problem #364 on consecutive powerful numbers. The quadruple impossibility follows from the simple observation that one of every four consecutive integers is ≡ 2 (mod 4), hence divisible by 2 but not 4. The triple case remains one of the classic open problems in combinatorial number theory, with computational searches to 10²² and connections to the abc conjecture.",
    "implications": "This problem illustrates how local obstructions (mod 4) can settle one case completely while leaving closely related cases wide open. The techniques connect prime factorization, modular arithmetic, and Diophantine equations (Pell theory).",
