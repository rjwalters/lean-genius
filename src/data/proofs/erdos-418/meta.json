Numbers not of the form we call non-cototients. It follows from the Goldbach conjecture that every odd number can be written as $n-\\phi(n)$. What happens for even numbers?\n\nBrowkin and Schinzel \\cite{BrSc95} provided an affirmative answer to this question, proving that any integer of the shape $2^{k}\\cdot 509203$ for $k\\geq 1$ is a non-cototient. It is open whether the set of non-cototients has positive density.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er73b} has shown that a positive density set of natural numbers cannot be written as $\\sigma(n)-n$ (numbers not of this form are called nonaliquot, or sometimes untouchable). Banks and Luca \\cite{BaLu05} have proved that the set of nonaliquots has lower density $\\geq 1/48$. This bound was improved to $0.06$ by Chen and Zhao \\cite{ChZh11}. Pollack and Pomerance \\cite{PoPo16} give a heuristic that predicts the density exactly (with a value of $\\approx 0.17$).\n\nThis is discussed in problem B36 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaLu05] Banks, William D. and Luca, Florian, Nonaliquots and {R}obbins numbers.
