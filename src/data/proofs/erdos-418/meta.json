  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdos Problem #418 was posed by Erdos and Sierpinski. It asks whether there are infinitely many 'non-cototients' - positive integers that cannot be expressed as n - phi(n) for any n, where phi is Euler's totient function.\n\nThe cototient of n is n - phi(n), which counts the integers from 1 to n that share a common factor with n. Numbers not in the range of this function are called non-cototients.\n\nBrowkin and Schinzel provided an affirmative answer in 1995, proving that any integer of the form 2^k * 509203 (for k >= 1) is a non-cototient. The mysterious number 509203 has special properties related to covering systems.\n\nIt remains open whether non-cototients have positive density. The Browkin-Schinzel construction gives a sparse set (powers of 2 times a constant). A related problem about nonaliquots (numbers not of the form sigma(n) - n) was shown by Erdos to have positive density.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many positive integers not of the form $n - \\phi(n)$?\n\n**Definition**: The cototient of $n$ is $n - \\phi(n)$. A **non-cototient** is a number that is not a cototient value for any $n$.\n\n**Answer**: YES\n\n**Proof**: Browkin and Schinzel (1995) showed that $2^k \\cdot 509203$ is a non-cototient for all $k \\geq 1$.\n\n**Status**: SOLVED",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining:\n\n1. **cototient(n)** = n - phi(n), the count of non-coprime integers\n2. **IsCototientValue(m)**: there exists n with cototient(n) = m\n3. **IsNonCototient(m)**: m > 0 and not a cototient value\n4. **NonCototients**: the set of all non-cototients\n\nWe verify cototient values for small n (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all cototients). The smallest non-cototient is 10.\n\nThe main theorem is stated as an axiom: NonCototients is infinite. The Browkin-Schinzel witness sequence 2^(k+1) * 509203 provides infinitely many examples.\n\nWe also formalize the conditional result that, assuming strengthened Goldbach, every odd number is a cototient.",
