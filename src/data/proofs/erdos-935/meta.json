  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked about the growth of the powerful part Q₂(n(n+1)⋯(n+ℓ)), the product of prime powers p^{kₚ} with kₚ ≥ 2 in the factorisation. Mahler proved lim sup Q₂/n² ≥ 1. All three questions remain open. Erdős remarked the problem 'seems very difficult to prove.'",
    "problemStatement": "For ℓ ≥ 1: (1) Is Q₂(n(n+1)⋯(n+ℓ)) < n^{2+ε} for large n? (2) For ℓ ≥ 2, is lim sup Q₂/n² = ∞? (3) Does Q₂/n^{ℓ+1} → 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatises the powerful part Q₂ with its basic properties (divisibility, powerful, multiplicative). Consecutive products and their powerful parts are defined. Mahler's lower bound and all three conjectures are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Q₂(n) extracts the 'square-full' part of the prime factorisation",
      "Mahler proved lim sup Q₂(n(n+1)⋯(n+ℓ))/n² ≥ 1",
      "Part 1 asks for the upper bound n^{2+ε}, just above the Mahler threshold",
      "Parts 2 and 3 ask whether ℓ ≥ 2 consecutive factors push Q₂ beyond n² but not as far as n^{ℓ+1}"
