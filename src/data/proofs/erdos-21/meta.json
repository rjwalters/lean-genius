  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Conjectured by Erdős and Lovász in 1975. They proved (8/3)n - 3 ≤ f(n) ≤ O(n^(3/2) log n). Kahn improved the upper bound to n log n in 1992, then proved the linear bound f(n) = O(n) in 1994, resolving the conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that there exists an intersecting family $\\mathcal{F}$ of $n$-sets with $|\\mathcal{F}| = f(n)$ such that every set $S$ with $|S| \\leq n-1$ is disjoint from at least one $A \\in \\mathcal{F}$. Is $f(n) = O(n)$?",
    "proofStrategy": "Kahn's 1994 proof uses probabilistic selection from projective planes: (1) Take a projective plane of order n-1 (when n-1 is a prime power), (2) Randomly select lines, (3) Show that with positive probability O(n) lines suffice to cover all (n-1)-sets.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "An intersecting family has all pairs sharing at least one element",
      "The covering condition forces the family to be 'spread out'",
      "Projective planes provide optimal constructions when n-1 is a prime power",
      "Lower bound (8/3)n uses counting arguments",
      "The exact constant is conjectured to be 3 (i.e., f(n) = 3n + O(1))"

    "summary": "Kahn (1994) proved f(n) = O(n), resolving the Erdős-Lovász conjecture. The exact bound is conjectured to be f(n) = 3n + O(1), but the gap between the lower bound (8/3)n and this conjecture remains open.",
    "implications": "The solution demonstrates the power of probabilistic methods in combinatorics and connects intersecting families to projective geometry.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Determine the exact leading constant: is f(n) = 3n + O(1)?",
      "Compute f(6) exactly (currently 13 ≤ f(6) ≤ 18)",
      "Prove or disprove f(n) ≤ 3n for all n",
      "Extend to f_k(n) covering (n-k)-sets"
