    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that there is an intersecting family $\\mathcal{F}$ of sets of size $n$ (so $A\\cap B\\neq\\emptyset$ for all $A,B\\in \\mathcal{F}$) with $\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert=f(n)$ such that any set $S$ with $\\lvert S\\rvert \\leq n-1$ is disjoint from at least one $A\\in \\mathcal{F}$. Is it true that\\[f(n) \\ll n?\\] Conjectured by Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75], who proved that\\[\\frac{8}{3}n-3\\leq f(n) \\ll n^{3/2}\\log n\\]for all $n$. The upper bound was improved by Kahn [Ka92b] to\\[f(n) \\ll n\\log n.\\](The upper bound constructions in both cases are formed by taking a random set of lines from a projective plane of order $n-1$, assuming $n-1$ is a prime power.) This problem was solved by Kahn [Ka94] who proved the upper bound $f(n) \\ll n$. The Erdős-Lovász lower bound of $\\frac{8}{3}n-O(1)$ has not been improved, and it has been speculated (see e.g. [Ka94]) that the correct answer is $3n+O(1)$. It is trivial that $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=3$. The values $f(3)=6$ and $f(4)=9$ were established",
