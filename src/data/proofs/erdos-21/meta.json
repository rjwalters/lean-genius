    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet f(n) be minimal such that there is an intersecting family F of n-sets (so A ∩ B ≠ ∅ for all A, B ∈ F) with |F| = f(n) such that every set S with |S| ≤ n-1 is disjoint from at least one A ∈ F.\n\nIs it true that f(n) ≪ n?\n\n**Solution (Kahn 1994):**\nYES! f(n) = O(n). The proof uses probabilistic selection from projective planes.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** Define intersecting families, covering property, uniform families.\n\n2. **CoveringFamily Structure:** Combine all conditions into a structure.\n\n3. **Function f(n):** Axiomatize as the minimum family size.\n\n4. **Known Values:** Axiomatize f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=6, f(4)=9, f(5)=13.\n\n5. **Bounds:** State Erdős-Lovász lower bound and Kahn's upper bounds.\n\n6. **Main Theorem:** Kahn 1994 f(n) = O(n).\n\n7. **Projective Planes:** Define structure and role in constructions.\n\n8. **Generalizations:** f_k(n) covering (n-k)-sets.",
