Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+t$ edges contain at least $t\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ triangles?\n\n\n\nRademacher proved that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+1$ edges contains at least $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ triangles. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er62d} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+t$ edges contains at least $t\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ triangles, for all $t<cn$, for some constant $c>0$.\n\nThis is true, and was proved independently by Lov\\'{a}sz and Simonovits \\cite{LoSi76} and Nikiforov and Khadzhiivanov \\cite{NiKh81}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er62d] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On a theorem of {R}ademacher-{T}ur\\'an.
