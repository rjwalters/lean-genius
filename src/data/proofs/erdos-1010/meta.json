  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem extends the classical Turán theorem (1941), which established that a triangle-free graph on n vertices has at most ⌊n²/4⌋ edges. Rademacher proved the first supersaturation result: exceeding this threshold by one edge forces at least ⌊n/2⌋ triangles. Erdős asked in 1962 whether adding t edges over the threshold forces t·⌊n/2⌋ triangles, for all t < ⌊n/2⌋.",
    "problemStatement": "Let t < ⌊n/2⌋. Does every graph on n vertices with ⌊n²/4⌋ + t edges contain at least t·⌊n/2⌋ triangles?",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem was solved independently by Lovász-Simonovits (1976) and Nikiforov-Khadzhiivanov (1981). The Lovász-Simonovits proof introduced the influential 'stability method' in extremal graph theory: graphs close to the extremal bound must structurally resemble the extremal example (the Turán graph).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Turán graph K_{⌊n/2⌋,⌈n/2⌉} is the unique triangle-free graph with ⌊n²/4⌋ edges",
      "Supersaturation quantifies how triangles 'explode' beyond the threshold",
      "The bound t·⌊n/2⌋ is tight: adding t edges to one part of the Turán graph creates exactly this many triangles",
      "The stability method shows near-extremal graphs must be close to bipartite"
