  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #809**\n\nThis problem lies at the intersection of extremal graph theory, Ramsey theory, and edge coloring.\n\n**Historical Background:**\n- Posed by Burr, Erdos, Graham, and Sos in 1991 [Er91]\n- They proved the quadratic lower bound F_k(n) >> n^2\n- Related to Problem #810, which concerns a variant of the same question\n\n**Key Context:**\n- The edge threshold floor(n^2/4) + 1 exceeds the Turan number\n- By Turan's theorem, any graph with this many edges must contain triangles\n- For longer odd cycles C_{2k+1}, similar density guarantees apply\n- The question: how many colors suffice to make all odd cycles rainbow?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $k \\geq 3$ and define $F_k(n)$ as the minimal $r$ such that there exists a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor + 1$ edges where the edges can be $r$-colored so that every subgraph isomorphic to $C_{2k+1}$ has no repeated colors on its edges.\n\n**Conjecture:** Is it true that $F_k(n) \\sim n^2/8$?\n\n**Status: OPEN**\n\n**Known Result:** Burr, Erdos, Graham, and Sos proved $F_k(n) \\gg n^2$, establishing a quadratic lower bound.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Structures:** Use Mathlib's SimpleGraph for vertices and edges\n\n2. **Edge Coloring:** Define EdgeColoring as a function from edges to naturals\n\n3. **Odd Cycles:** Define OddCycle structure with vertices and adjacency constraints\n\n4. **Rainbow Property:** IsRainbow checks that all edges in a subgraph have distinct colors\n\n5. **The F Function:** Define as infimum over valid colorings of dense graphs\n\n6. **Known Results:** Axiomatize Turan's theorem and Burr-Erdos-Graham-Sos lower bound\n\n7. **Conjecture Statement:** Express F_k(n) ~ n^2/8 using Filter.Tendsto\n\n8. **Open Status:** Mark the problem as unresolved with supporting discussion",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Rainbow Subgraphs:** A subgraph is rainbow if each edge has a unique color - this constraint on odd cycles drives the coloring complexity",
      "**Turan Threshold:** With floor(n^2/4) + 1 edges, the graph is just barely too dense to be bipartite, forcing odd cycles",
      "**Quadratic Scaling:** Both the lower bound (known) and conjectured value are Theta(n^2), differing only in the constant",
      "**The Constant 1/8:** The conjecture claims F_k(n)/n^2 -> 1/8, exactly half the edge density n^2/4",
      "**Ramsey Connection:** This is a rainbow Ramsey problem: forcing rainbow structures via density",
      "**Open for 30+ Years:** Despite the simple statement, the exact asymptotics remain unresolved since 1991"
