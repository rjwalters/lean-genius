    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Burr, Erdős, Graham, and Sós. They proved F_k(n) ≫ n², establishing a quadratic lower bound. The conjecture that F_k(n) ~ n²/8 remains open. The problem connects Turán-type extremal graph theory with rainbow coloring theory.",
    "problemStatement": "For k ≥ 3, define F_k(n) as the minimal r such that there exists a graph G on n vertices with ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1 edges where the edges can be r-colored so that every C_{2k+1} subgraph is rainbow (no color repeats). Is F_k(n) ~ n²/8?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines graphs, edge colorings, cycles, and the rainbow property. The function F_k(n) is formalized, along with the main conjecture. The Burr-Erdős-Graham-Sós lower bound is axiomatized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "⌊n²/4⌋ + 1 edges is just above Turán's threshold for odd cycles",
      "The conjecture predicts F_k(n) ~ n²/8, exactly half of Turán threshold",
