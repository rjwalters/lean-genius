Erd\\H{o}s first offered \\$250 for a proof and \\$100 for a counterexample, but in \\cite{Er93} offered \\$500 for a counterexample.\n\nDisproved by Janzer \\cite{Ja23b} who constructed, for any $\\epsilon>0$, a $3$-regular bipartite graph $H$ such that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H)\\ll n^{\\frac{4}{3}+\\epsilon}.\\]See also [146] and [147] and the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er93] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some of my favorite solved and unsolved problems in graph\ntheory.
