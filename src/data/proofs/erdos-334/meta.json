  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős originally asked (circa 1980) whether f(n) ≤ n^{1/3} holds, where f(n) is the minimal smoothness bound needed to write n = a + b with both summands f(n)-smooth. This question was answered positively, and Balog (1989) obtained the current best bound f(n) << n^{4/(9√e)+ε} ≈ n^{0.2695} for all ε > 0. The problem asks for the true growth rate of f(n).",
    "problemStatement": "Find the best function f(n) such that every n can be written as n = a + b where both a and b are f(n)-smooth (that is, are not divisible by any prime p > f(n)).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize smooth numbers and smooth pair representations, state Balog's 1989 bound as the current best result, and express the conjectured bounds f(n) ≤ n^{o(1)} and f(n) ≤ e^{O(√log n)} as open problems. Concrete examples for small numbers demonstrate the definitions.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A number is y-smooth if all its prime factors are at most y",
      "The key question is: how small can y be while still guaranteeing n = a + b with a, b both y-smooth?",
      "Balog's exponent 4/(9√e) ≈ 0.2695 improved Erdős's original n^{1/3} bound",
      "The Dickman function ρ(u) governs the density of smooth numbers",
      "The problem connects to Goldbach-type questions about additive representations"
