This is known, and the best bound is due to Balog \\cite{Ba89} who proved that\\[f(n) \\ll_\\epsilon n^{\\frac{4}{9\\sqrt{e}}+\\epsilon}\\]for all $\\epsilon>0$. (Note $\\frac{4}{9\\sqrt{e}}=0.2695\\ldots$.)\n\nIt is likely that $f(n)\\leq n^{o(1)}$, or even $f(n)\\leq e^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$.\n\nSee also Problem 59 on Green's open problems list.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ba89] Balog, A., On additive representation of integers.
