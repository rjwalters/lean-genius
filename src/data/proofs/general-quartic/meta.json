    "historicalContext": "The quartic formula represents the culmination of Renaissance algebra. While Cardano's Ars Magna (1545) is famous for the cubic formula, it was his student Lodovico Ferrari who, at age 18, discovered how to solve the quartic by reducing it to a cubic.\n\nThe key insight is brilliant: by adding a parameter m and completing the square, the quartic can be written as a difference of squares, which factors. Finding the right m requires solving a cubic equation (the 'resolvent cubic'). This creates a tower of solutions:\n- Quadratic: Direct formula\n- Cubic: Cardano's formula\n- Quartic: Ferrari's method (uses cubic)\n- Quintic and beyond: Abel-Ruffini (1824) proves no general formula exists!\n\nThis historical sequence explains why we can solve up to degree 4 but not degree 5+: the Galois groups S2, S3, S4 are solvable, but S5 is not.",
    "problemStatement": "**Ferrari's Problem (Wiedijk #46)**:\n\nEvery quartic equation\n$$x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$$\ncan be solved by radicals using Ferrari's method:\n\n1. Reduce to depressed form $y^4 + py^2 + qy + r = 0$ via $y = x + a/4$\n2. Find auxiliary parameter $m$ from the resolvent cubic\n3. Factor as product of two quadratics\n4. Apply the quadratic formula to each factor\n\nThe resolvent cubic is:\n$$8m^3 + 20pm^2 + (16p^2 - 8r)m + (4p^3 - 4pr - q^2) = 0$$",
    "proofStrategy": "Ferrari's method proceeds as follows:\n\n**Step 1 - Depress the Quartic:**\nSubstitute $y = x + a/4$ to eliminate the cubic term, yielding $y^4 + py^2 + qy + r = 0$.\n\n**Step 2 - Complete the Square:**\nRewrite as $(y^2 + p/2)^2 = (p^2/4 - r) - qy$. Add a parameter $m$ and complete the square on the right side.\n\n**Step 3 - Find m:**\nFor the right side to be a perfect square $(\\alpha y + \\beta)^2$, its discriminant must vanish. This gives the resolvent cubic in $m$.\n\n**Step 4 - Factor:**\nWith $m$ found, we have $(y^2 + p/2 + m)^2 = (\\alpha y + \\beta)^2$, giving $y^2 + p/2 + m = \\pm(\\alpha y + \\beta)$.\n\n**Step 5 - Solve:**\nEach equation is quadratic, yielding 2 roots each, for 4 total. Subtract $a/4$ to get the original roots.",

    "summary": "Ferrari's method elegantly reduces the quartic to a cubic plus quadratics, demonstrating the power of algebraic manipulation. The resolvent cubic is the key: finding the right parameter m allows the quartic to be written as a difference of squares, which then factors.",
    "implications": "This result has profound implications:\n\n1. **Solvability Boundary**: The quartic is the last degree solvable by radicals. Abel (1824) and Ruffini proved that degree 5+ has no general formula, later explained by Galois theory.\n\n2. **Galois Groups**: The solvability of S4 (via S4 > A4 > V4 > {e}) is why Ferrari's method works. S5 contains the simple non-abelian group A5, blocking any formula.\n\n3. **Classical Geometry**: Quartic equations arise in many geometric constructions, particularly in problems involving conics.\n\n4. **Computer Algebra**: Modern CAS systems implement these formulas for exact symbolic solutions.",
