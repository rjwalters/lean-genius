    "content": "maxTerm(a, r) = sup_n |aₙ| rⁿ is the maximum term of the power series with coefficients a. maxModulus(a, r) = sup_{|z|=r} |f(z)| is the maximum modulus. termModulusRatio computes μ(r)/M(r) with a guard for M(r) = 0. IsTranscendentalEntire requires infinitely many nonzero coefficients.",
    "significance": "These definitions capture the two fundamental measures of growth for entire functions. The ratio μ/M governs how well the maximum term approximates the maximum modulus."

    "content": "Kövári (unpublished) showed that there exists a transcendental entire function for which liminf_{r→∞} μ(r)/M(r) > 1/2. This means the supremum over all such functions exceeds 1/2.",
    "significance": "This is the best known lower bound for the supremum. Improving it would narrow the gap with the Clunie–Hayman upper bound."

    "content": "Clunie and Hayman proved that for every transcendental entire function, liminf_{r→∞} μ(r)/M(r) ≤ 2/π - c for an absolute constant c > 0. In particular, the supremum is strictly less than 2/π ≈ 0.6366.",
    "significance": "This is the strongest known upper bound. The strict gap below 2/π shows the answer is not the 'natural' value 2/π."

    "title": "The Exact Supremum",
    "content": "Erdős asked for the exact value L = sup liminf_{r→∞} μ(r)/M(r) over all transcendental entire functions. The formalization asserts L exists in (1/2, 2/π) and is approached by a sequence of entire functions.",
    "significance": "Determining L would resolve a fundamental question in the Wiman–Valiron theory of entire functions, connecting the maximum term to the maximum modulus."
