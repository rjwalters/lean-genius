Must $S$ contain an abelian square: two consecutive blocks $x$ and $y$ such that $y$ is a permutation of $x$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s initially conjectured that the answer is yes for all $k\\geq 2$, but for $k=4$ this was disproved by de Bruijn and Erd\\H{o}s. At least, this is what Erd\\H{o}s writes, but gives no construction or reference, and a simple computer search produces no such counterexamples for $k=4$. Perhaps Erd\\H{o}s meant $2^k$, where indeed there is an example for $k=4$:\\[1213121412132124.\\]Erd\\H{o}s then asked if there is in fact an infinite string formed from $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ which contains no abelian squares? This is equivalent to [192], and such a string was constructed by Keränen \\cite{Ke92}. The existence of this infinite string gives a negative answer to the problem for all $k\\geq 4$.\n\nContaining no abelian squares is a stronger property than being squarefree (the existence of infinitely long squarefree strings over alphabets with $k\\geq 3$ characters was established by Thue).\n\nWe refer to a recent survey by Fici and Puzynina \\cite{FiPu23} for more background and related results.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FiPu23] Fici, Gabriele and Puzynina, Svetlana, Abelian combinatorics on words: a survey.
