  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about products of integers from multiple disjoint intervals. Erdős and Selfridge famously proved in 1975 that the product of two or more consecutive positive integers is NEVER a perfect power. This resolved the r=1 case of Problem #930.\n\nThe general case asks: for r disjoint intervals of consecutive integers, all sufficiently long, is their combined product never a perfect power? The condition that intervals be 'sufficiently long' (length at least k, where k depends on r) is necessary—without it, counterexamples exist for r=2.\n\nThe Erdős-Selfridge proof uses sophisticated arguments about prime multiplicities. The key insight is that for any product of consecutive integers, there exists a prime whose multiplicity is not divisible by any given l > 1, preventing the product from being a perfect l-th power.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that, for every $r$, there is a $k$ such that if $I_1,\\ldots,I_r$ are disjoint intervals of consecutive integers, all of length at least $k$, then\n$$\\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq r}\\prod_{m\\in I_i}m$$\nis not a perfect power?\n\n**Status**:\n- **OPEN** for general $r > 1$\n- **SOLVED** for $r = 1$ (Erdős-Selfridge, 1975)\n\n**Known**: The product of $k \\geq 2$ consecutive positive integers $(n+1)(n+2)\\cdots(n+k)$ is never a perfect power.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Defining perfect powers**: `IsPower n` holds if n = m^l for some l > 1\n\n2. **Stating the main conjecture**: For every r > 0, there exists k such that r disjoint intervals of length ≥ k have a non-power product\n\n3. **Axiomatizing the Erdős-Selfridge theorem**: The r=1 case is stated as an axiom\n\n4. **Technical lemma**: The prime multiplicity result that drives the proof\n\n5. **Verified examples**: Basic properties of perfect powers and small cases",

      "**The key technical lemma**: For k ≥ 3 and sufficiently large n, there exists a prime p ≥ k such that l ∤ ord_p((n+1)...(n+k)).",
