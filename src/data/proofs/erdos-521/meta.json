    "historicalContext": "Kac (1943) first computed expected real roots of random polynomials using an integral formula. Erdős and Offord (1956) extended this to ±1 coefficients, showing E[Rₙ] = (2/π + o(1))log n. Erdős asked whether this holds almost surely, not just in expectation. Do (2024) proved the a.s. result for roots in [-1,1], but the full problem remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (PARTIALLY SOLVED / OPEN)**\n\nLet (εₖ) be i.i.d. uniform on {-1, 1}. If Rₙ counts real roots of f_n(z) = Σ_{k=0}^n εₖ z^k, is it true that almost surely:\n  lim_{n→∞} Rₙ/log n = 2/π?\n\n**Known:** E[Rₙ] = (2/π + o(1))log n (Erdős-Offord 1956)\n\n**Partial:** A.s. lim Rₙ[-1,1]/log n = 1/π (Do 2024)\n\n**Open:** Full a.s. convergence Rₙ/log n → 2/π",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines random ±1 polynomials and the root counting functions. The Kac constant 2/π is defined. Erdős-Offord's expectation result and variance bound are axiomatized. Do's 2024 partial result for roots in [-1,1] is stated. Kac's integral formula explains the origin of 2/π.",
