    "content": "The function f(n) satisfies p(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ n/P(n) for composite n ≥ 2, where p(n) is the smallest prime factor and P(n) the largest. This follows from properties of binomial coefficients and Kummer's theorem on p-adic valuations.",

    "significance": "This conjecture connects to the distribution of prime factors and would quantify how far f(n) is from its upper bound for typical composite numbers."
