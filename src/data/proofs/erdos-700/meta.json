  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Szekeres studied the function f(n) = min_{1<k≤n/2} gcd(n, C(n,k)), which measures how divisible n is by binomial coefficients. The function is well-understood for semiprimes (f(pq) = p) but its behavior for general composite numbers is mysterious.",
    "problemStatement": "Three questions about f(n): (1) Which composite n satisfy f(n) = n/P(n)? (2) Do infinitely many composite n have f(n) > √n? (3) Is f(n) ≪_A n/(log n)^A for all A?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize f(n), state the basic sandwich f(n) ∈ [p(n), n/P(n)], record exact values for semiprimes and n=30, and formalize all three open questions.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "f(pq) = p = n/P(n) for semiprimes, providing the simplest exact computation",
      "f(p²) ≥ p = √n shows Question 2 holds for prime squares",
      "The upper bound conjecture f(n) ≪ n/(log n)^A would mean f is much smaller than n/P(n) for most n",
      "The function connects binomial coefficient divisibility to prime factorization structure",
      "n = 30 is a notable non-semiprime example with f(30) = 6 = 30/5"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #700 poses three questions about the minimum gcd of n with its binomial coefficients. The function is exactly computed for semiprimes but poorly understood in general, with all three questions remaining open.",
    "implications": "Resolution would advance the arithmetic theory of binomial coefficients, connecting to Kummer's theorem on p-adic valuations, Pascal's triangle modular patterns, and the distribution of prime factors.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Which composite n beyond semiprimes and 30 satisfy f(n) = n/P(n)?",
