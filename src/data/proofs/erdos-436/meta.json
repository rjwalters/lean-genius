  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from the 1962 paper 'On runs of residues' by D.H. Lehmer and Emma Lehmer, who introduced the function Λ(k,m) measuring consecutive kth power residues. The problem asks fundamental questions about how power residues distribute among consecutive integers. The Lehmers computed Λ(2,2)=9 using an elegant argument: 9=3² is always a quadratic residue, and if 10 isn't a QR, then either 2 or 5 must be, giving consecutive pairs. This sparked extensive computational work in the 1960s by Dunton, Bierstedt, Mills, Brillhart, and Selfridge computing exact values for small k. Hildebrand's 1991 theorem settling the m=2 case was a major breakthrough using sophisticated analytic methods.",
    "problemStatement": "For prime p and k,m ≥ 2, let r(k,m,p) be the minimal r such that r, r+1, ..., r+m-1 are all kth power residues modulo p. Define Λ(k,m) = lim sup_{p→∞} r(k,m,p). Questions: (1) Is Λ(k,2) finite for all k? (2) Is Λ(k,3) finite for all odd k? (3) How large are Λ(k,2) and Λ(k,3)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatizes the known results: Hildebrand's theorem (Λ(k,2) finite for all k), Graham's theorem (Λ(k,m)=∞ for m≥4), and the Lehmer-Lehmer result (Λ(k,3)=∞ for even k). Exact computed values are recorded as axioms. The key definitions capture kth power residues via x^k ≡ r (mod p) and consecutive runs via universal quantification over i < m.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Problem #436 is partially solved. Hildebrand's 1991 theorem resolves Question 1 affirmatively: Λ(k,2) is finite for all k. Graham's 1964 theorem shows Λ(k,m)=∞ for m≥4. The Lehmers showed Λ(k,3)=∞ for even k. Question 2 (whether Λ(k,3) is finite for odd k≥5) remains open, with only Λ(3,3)=23532 known to be finite. The growth rate of Λ(k,2) and exact asymptotic behavior remain open.",
    "implications": "The results reveal a fundamental asymmetry in power residue distribution: pairs can always be found within bounded range, but longer runs cannot. This connects to deep questions about character sums and the distribution of multiplicative characters.",
