    "historicalContext": "D.H. Lehmer and Emma Lehmer initiated this problem in 1962 with their paper 'On runs of residues'. They showed Λ(2,2)=9 with an elegant argument. Extensive computations in the 1960s by Dunton, Bierstedt, Mills, Brillhart, and Selfridge found exact values through k=7. Hildebrand's 1991 theorem using character sums and the large sieve resolved Question 1. Graham (1964) proved the m≥4 case is always infinite.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (PARTIALLY SOLVED)**\n\nFor prime p and k, m ≥ 2, let r(k,m,p) = min{r : r,...,r+m-1 are kth power residues mod p}.\nDefine Λ(k,m) = lim sup_{p→∞} r(k,m,p).\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Is Λ(k,2) finite for all k? [SOLVED: YES - Hildebrand 1991]\n2. Is Λ(k,3) finite for all odd k? [OPEN]\n3. What is the growth rate of Λ(k,m)? [PARTIAL]",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines kth power residues and consecutive runs. The Λ(k,m) function captures lim sup behavior. Hildebrand's theorem, Graham's theorem, and the Lehmer-Lehmer parity result for m=3 are axiomatized. Exact computed values are recorded.",
