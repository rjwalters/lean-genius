  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The **factor difference set** D(n) was introduced by Erdős and Rosenfeld in 1997 to study the arithmetic structure of integers through their factorizations.\n\n**Definition**: D(n) = {|a - b| : n = ab}\n\nFor example:\n- D(12) = {11, 4, 1} from factorizations 1×12, 2×6, 3×4\n- D(6) = {5, 1} from factorizations 1×6, 2×3\n\n**Timeline of Results**:\n- 1997: Erdős-Rosenfeld prove k = 2\n- 1999: Jiménez-Urroz proves k = 3\n- 2019: Bremner proves k = 4\n- 2019+: k ≥ 5 remains OPEN\n\nThe difficulty increases exponentially with k because finding integers with large D(n) intersections requires coordinating many divisibility constraints.",
    "problemStatement": "For integer $n \\geq 1$, define the **factor difference set** of $n$ by\n$$D(n) = \\{|a - b| : n = ab\\}$$\n\n**Erdős Problem #885**: Is it true that for every $k \\geq 1$, there exist integers $N_1 < \\cdots < N_k$ such that\n$$|\\bigcap_i D(N_i)| \\geq k?$$\n\n**Status by k**:\n- $k = 2$: SOLVED (Erdős-Rosenfeld 1997)\n- $k = 3$: SOLVED (Jiménez-Urroz 1999)\n- $k = 4$: SOLVED (Bremner 2019)\n- $k \\geq 5$: **OPEN**",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Factor difference set**: D(n) = {|a - b| : n = ab} as a set of natural numbers\n\n2. **k-common sets**: A Finset of k positive integers whose D(n) sets share ≥ k elements\n\n3. **Main conjecture**: For all k ≥ 1, a k-common set exists\n\n4. **Solved cases**: Axiomatize results for k = 2, 3, 4\n\n5. **Properties**: Connection to divisors, cardinality formulas, and examples\n\n6. **Verified computations**: Show specific elements in D(6) and D(12)",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**D(n) size**: |D(n)| = ⌈d(n)/2⌉ where d(n) is the number of divisors. Highly composite numbers have larger D(n).",
      "**Why finding intersections is hard**: D(n) grows slowly (logarithmically in n), so finding k integers with k common differences requires careful construction.",
      "**The role of highly composite numbers**: Numbers like 12, 24, 60, 120 with many divisors are natural candidates for building k-common sets.",
      "**Computational barrier**: For k = 4, Bremner needed sophisticated search algorithms. For k = 5+, no construction is known.",
      "**Connection to Diophantine equations**: Finding k-common sets reduces to solving systems of equations about factorizations."
