What is the largest integer not of the form\\[\\sum_{1\\leq i<n}c_i\\binom{n}{i}\\]where the $c_i\\geq 0$ are integers?\n\n\n\nIf $n=\\prod p_k^{a_k}$ then the largest integer not of this form is\\[\\sum_k \\left( \\sum_{1\\leq d\\leq a_k}\\binom{n}{p_k^d}\\right)(p_k-1)-n.\\]This was first proved by Hwang and Song \\cite{HwSo24}. Independently this was found in the comment section by Peake and Cambie.\n\nThe sequence of such thresholds is A389479 in the OEIS.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[HwSo24] W. Hwang and K.
