In particular, is $f(N)=(\\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))N$?\n\n\n\n\nThe colouring version of this is [303], which was solved by Brown and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{BrRo91}. One can take either $A$ to be all odd integers in $[1,N]$ or all integers in $[N/2,N]$ to show $f(N)\\geq (1/2+o(1))N$.\n\nWouter van Doorn has proved (see this note) that\\[f(N) \\leq (9/10+o(1))N.\\]Stijn Cambie has observed that\\[f(N)\\geq (5/8+o(1))N,\\]taking $A$ to be all odd integers $\\leq N/4$ and all integers in $[N/2,N]$.\n\nStijn Cambie has also observed that, if we allow $b=c$, then there is a solution to this equation when $\\lvert A\\rvert \\geq (\\tfrac{2}{3}+o(1))N$, since then there must exist some $n,2n\\in A$.\n\nSee also [301] and [327].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BrRo91] Brown, Tom C. and R\\\"{o}dl, Voijtech, Monochromatic solutions to equations with unit fractions.
