  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed the problem of characterizing which finite 3-uniform hypergraphs must appear in every 3-uniform hypergraph of uncountable chromatic number. For ordinary graphs, this is completely solved: the unavoidable graphs are precisely the bipartite ones. Erdős, Galvin, and Hajnal investigated the broader framework. The 3-uniform case remains wide open. From Erdős (1995), $500 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear in every 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number > ℵ₀.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define Hypergraph3, proper coloring, ChromaticNumberLE, and subhypergraph embedding. IsUnavoidable captures the central property. The solved graph case (bipartite characterization) is axiomatized. For the 3-uniform case, we state that 2-colorable hypergraphs are unavoidable and note the open characterization.",
