  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Fourier introduced his series in 1807 while studying heat conduction, publishing the full theory in 1822. The question of convergence provoked intense debate and led to major developments in analysis, including the rigorous definition of functions and integrals.",
    "problemStatement": "**Fourier Series**: A periodic function f with period 2*pi can be represented as:\n\n$$f(x) = \\frac{a_0}{2} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (a_n \\cos(nx) + b_n \\sin(nx))$$\n\nwhere the Fourier coefficients are integrals of f against the trigonometric functions.",
    "proofStrategy": "For L^2 functions, the proof uses the theory of Hilbert spaces: the trigonometric functions form an orthonormal basis for L^2([0,2*pi]). Parseval's theorem shows the series converges in L^2 norm. Pointwise convergence requires additional regularity.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "L^2 convergence holds for all square-integrable functions",
      "Pointwise convergence requires smoothness conditions",
      "The Fourier series is the best L^2 approximation by trig polynomials",
