They further note that if the roots are restricted to $[-2,2]$ then the infimum is zero, as witnessed by a small perturbation of the Chebyshev polynomials.\n\nThey further conjectured that, if the roots are restricted to $[-2,2]$, then\\[\\lvert \\{ x\\in \\mathbb{R} : \\lvert f(x)\\rvert < 1\\}\\rvert\\geq n^{-c}\\]for an absolute constant $c>0$. This was proved by Pommerenke \\cite{Po61}, who in fact showed that this set must contain an interval of width $\\gg n^{-4}$.\n\nThe current best known bounds (see the discussion in the comments) are\\[1.519\\approx 2^{4/3}-1\\leq \\inf \\leq 1.835\\cdots\\]and\\[\\sup = 2\\sqrt{2}\\approx 2.828.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHP58] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Herzog, F. and Piranian, G., Metric properties of polynomials.
