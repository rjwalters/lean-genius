  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian in their 1958 paper 'Metric properties of polynomials.' They studied the sublevel set {x ∈ ℝ : |f(x)| < 1} for monic polynomials with real roots restricted to [-1, 1].\n\nThe 1958 paper proved the upper bound sup ≤ 2√2 when roots are in {-1, 1}, and conjectured this is optimal for roots in [-1, 1]. They also showed the infimum is less than 2 using polynomials like (x+1)(x-1)³.\n\nTerence Tao resolved the supremum question in December 2025, confirming that sup = 2√2 for the full class of polynomials with roots in [-1, 1]. The exact infimum remains an open problem, with current best bounds 2^(4/3) - 1 ≈ 1.519 ≤ inf ≤ 1.835.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f \\in \\mathbb{R}[x]$ be a non-constant monic polynomial with all roots real and in $[-1,1]$. Determine:\n\n$$\\sup_f |\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |f(x)| < 1\\}| = 2\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n$$1.519 \\approx 2^{4/3} - 1 \\leq \\inf_f |\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} : |f(x)| < 1\\}| \\leq 1.835$$\n\nThe supremum was proved by Tao (2025). The exact infimum remains open.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the main results as axioms since the proofs require potential theory beyond current Mathlib:\n\n1. **Supremum axiom**: The supremum equals 2√2, achieved by polynomials approaching (x-1)(x+1) = x² - 1\n\n2. **Infimum bounds**: Lower bound via potential theory, upper bound witnessed by explicit constructions\n\n3. **Type handling**: Volume returns ℝ≥0∞ (extended non-negative reals), requiring ENNReal.ofReal for comparisons with real constants",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Sublevel sets**: For a polynomial f, the sublevel set {x : |f(x)| < 1} measures where the polynomial stays small",
      "**Monic constraint**: Requiring f to be monic (leading coefficient 1) normalizes the problem",
      "**Root constraint**: Restricting roots to [-1,1] ensures the polynomial oscillates within a bounded region",
      "**Potential theory connection**: The measure relates to logarithmic capacity and equilibrium measures",
      "**Chebyshev connection**: The problem connects to Chebyshev polynomials, which minimize sup-norm on [-1,1]"
