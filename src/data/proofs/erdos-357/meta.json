Let $f(n)$ be the maximal such $k$.\n\nHow does $f(n)$ grow? Is $f(n)=o(n)$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Harzheim. In \\cite{Er77c} Erd\\H{o}s asks about an infinite such set of integers, and whether such a set must have density $0$. He notes that a simple averaging process implies $a_k \\gg k\\log k$ for infinitely many $k$, and so the lower density is $0$. He also asks whether $\\sum\\frac{1}{a_k}$ must converge.\n\nWeisenberg in the comments observes that any set which satisfies [874] also has this property, which implies $f(n)\\geq (2+o(1))n^{1/2}$.\n\nIf $g(n)$ is the maximal $k$ such that there are $1\\leq a_1,\\ldots,a_k\\leq n$ with all consecutive sums distinct (i.e. we drop the monotonicity assumption in the definition of $f$) then Hegyv\\'{a}ri \\cite{He86} has proved that\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+o(1)\\right) n\\leq g(n)\\leq \\left(\\frac{2}{3}+o(1)\\right)n.\\]The upper bound of Coppersmith and Phillips in [867] implies\\[g(n) \\leq \\left(\\frac{2}{3}-\\frac{1}{512}+o(1)\\right)n.\\]A similar question can be asked if we replace strict monotonicity with weak monotonicity (i.e. we allow $a_i=a_j$).\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Harzheim also ask what is the least $m$ which is not a sum of the given form? Can it be much larger than $n$? Erd\\H{o}s and Harzheim can show that $\\sum_{x<a_i<x^2}\\frac{1}{a_i}\\ll 1$. Is it true that $\\sum_i \\frac{1}{a_i}\\ll 1$?\n\nSee also [34], [356], [670], and [867].
