    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $F(x)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist $n+1,\\ldots,n+k\\leq x$ with $\\tau(n+1),\\ldots,\\tau(n+k)$ all distinct (where $\\tau(m)$ counts the divisors of $m$). Estimate $F(x)$. In particular, is it true that\\[F(x) \\leq (\\log x)^{O(1)}?\\]In other words, is there a constant $C>0$ such that, for all large $x$, every interval $[x,x+(\\log x)^C]$ contains two integers with the same number of divisors?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Mirsky \\cite{ErMi52}, who proved that\\[\\frac{(\\log x)^{1/2}}{\\log\\log x}\\ll F(x) \\ll \\exp\\left(O\\left(\\frac{(\\log x)^{1/2}}{\\log\\log x}\\right)\\right).\\]Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er85e} claimed that the lower bound could be improved via their method 'with some more work' to $(\\log x)^{1-o(1)}$. Beker has improved the upper bound to\\[F(x) \\ll \\exp\\left(O\\left((\\log x)^{1/3+o(1)}\\right)\\right).\\]Cambie has observed that Cram\\'{er's conjecture} implies that $F(x) \\ll (\\log x)^2$, and furthermore if every interval in $[x,2x]$ of length $\\gg \\log x$ contains a squarefree number (see [208]) then every interval of length $\\gg (\\log x)^2$ contains two numbers with the same number of divisors, whence\\[F(x) \\ll (\\log x)^2.\\]See [1004] for the analogous problem with the Euler totient function.\n\nThis problem is discussed in problem B18 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er85e] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some problems and results in number theory.
