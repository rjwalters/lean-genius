    "problemStatement": "Let $B\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis of order $k$ with $0\\in B$. Is it true that for every $A\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}$ we have\\[d_s(A+B)\\geq \\alpha+\\frac{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)}{k},\\]where $\\alpha=d_s(A)$ and\\[d_s(A) = \\inf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N}\\]is the Schnirelmann density? Erdős [Er36c] proved this is true with $k$ replaced by $2k$ in the denominator (in a stronger form that only considers $A\\cup (A+b)$ for some $b\\in B$, see [38]). Ruzsa has observed that this follows immediately from the stronger fact proved by Plünnecke [Pl70] that (under the same assumptions)\\[d_S(A+B)\\geq \\alpha^{1-1/k}.\\] View the LaTeX source",
