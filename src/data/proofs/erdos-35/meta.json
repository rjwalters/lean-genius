    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1956 [Er56], having proved a weaker version with 2k in the denominator in 1936 [Er36c]. Plünnecke's 1970 paper [Pl70] proved the stronger inequality d_s(A+B) ≥ α^{1-1/k}, from which Ruzsa observed the original conjecture follows immediately.",
    "problemStatement": "Let B ⊆ ℕ be an additive basis of order k with 0 ∈ B. Is it true that for every A ⊆ ℕ, d_s(A+B) ≥ α + α(1-α)/k where α = d_s(A) is the Schnirelmann density?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize Schnirelmann density and additive bases, state Plünnecke's inequality as the key lemma, and show how the main theorem follows from a calculus bound on α^{1-1/k}.",

      "Schnirelmann density d_s(A) = inf_{N≥1} |A ∩ {1,...,N}| / N",

      "Plünnecke (1970) proved the stronger d_s(A+B) ≥ α^{1-1/k}",
