    "historicalContext": "Buffon's Needle Problem was posed by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1777. It is one of the earliest problems in geometric probability and was published in his 'Essai d'arithmetique morale'. The problem asks: if a needle of length l is dropped randomly onto a floor marked with parallel lines spaced distance d apart, what is the probability that the needle crosses one of the lines?\n\nThe surprising answer involves pi, providing one of the first Monte Carlo methods for estimating this constant.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Buffon, 1777)**: If a needle of length l is dropped randomly onto a floor with parallel lines spaced distance d apart (where l <= d), the probability it crosses a line is:\n\n$$P = \\frac{2\\ell}{\\pi d}$$\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #99.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Geometric Probability Setup**:\n\n1. Model the needle drop with two uniform random variables:\n   - Angle theta in [0, pi): orientation of the needle\n   - Position x in [0, d/2]: distance from center to nearest line\n2. The needle crosses a line when x <= (l/2)*sin(theta)\n3. Compute the probability as the ratio of favorable to total area:\n   - Crossing region area: integral from 0 to pi of (l/2)*sin(theta) = l\n   - Sample space area: (d/2) * pi = pi*d/2\n4. Therefore P = l / (pi*d/2) = 2l/(pi*d)",
