Does the density of integers $n$ for which $\\binom{n}{k}$ is squarefree for at least $r$ values of $1\\leq k<n$ exist? Is this density $>0$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham state they can prove that, for $k$ fixed and large, the density of $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is squarefree is $o_k(1)$. They can also prove that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is not squarefree for $1\\leq k<n$, and expect that the density of such $n$ is positive.\n\nAggarwal and Cambie have observed this problem is resolved by the results of Granville and Ramar\\'{e} \\cite{GrRa96}, who in particular show that the density of the set of those $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is squarefree for exactly $2m+2$ many values of $k$ exists. If this density is $\\eta_m$, then the density in the original question is simply\\[1-\\sum_{0\\leq m\\leq \\frac{r-1}{2}}\\eta_m.\\]This density is positive since $\\eta_{r+1}>0$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GrRa96] Granville, Andrew and Ramar\\'{e}, Olivier, Explicit bounds on exponential sums and the scarcity of\nsquarefree binomial coefficients.
