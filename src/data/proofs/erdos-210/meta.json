For any $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, not all on a line, there must be at least $f(n)$ many lines which contain exactly 2 points (called 'ordinary lines'). Does $f(n)\\to \\infty$? How fast?\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and de Bruijn. The Sylvester-Gallai theorem states that $f(n)\\geq 1$. The fact that $f(n)\\geq 1$ was conjectured by Sylvester in 1893. Erd\\H{o}s rediscovered this conjecture in 1933 and told it to Gallai who proved it.\n\nThat $f(n)\\to \\infty$ was proved by Motzkin \\cite{Mo51}. Kelly and Moser \\cite{KeMo58} proved that $f(n)\\geq\\tfrac{3}{7}n$ for all $n$. This is best possible for $n=7$. Motzkin conjectured that for $n\\geq 13$ there are at least $n/2$ such lines. Csima and Sawyer \\cite{CsSa93} proved a lower bound of $f(n)\\geq \\tfrac{6}{13}n$ when $n\\geq 8$. Green and Tao \\cite{GrTa13} proved that $f(n)\\geq n/2$ for sufficiently large $n$. (A proof that $f(n)\\geq n/2$ for large $n$ was earlier claimed by Hansen but this proof was flawed.)\n\nThe bound of $n/2$ is best possible for even $n$, since one could take $n/2$ points on a circle and $n/2$ points at infinity. Surprisingly, Green and Tao \\cite{GrTa13} show that if $n$ is odd (and sufficiently large) then $f(n)\\geq 3\\lfloor n/4\\rfloor$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CsSa93] Csima, J. and Sawyer, E.
