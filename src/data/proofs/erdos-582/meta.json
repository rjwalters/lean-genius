    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nDoes there exist a graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$, and yet any $2$-colouring of the edges produces a monochromatic $K_3$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Hajnal \\cite{ErHa67} first asked for the existence of any such graph. Existence was proved by Folkman \\cite{Fo70}, but with very poor quantitative bounds. (As a result these quantities are often called Folkman numbers.) Let this particular Folkman number be denoted by $N$.\n\nFrankl and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{FrRo86} proved $N\\leq 7\\times 10^{11}$, which Spencer \\cite{Sp88} improved to $\\leq 3\\times 10^{9}$. This resolved the challenge of Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75d} to find such a graph with less than $10^{10}$ vertices.\n\nLu \\cite{Lu07} proved $N\\leq 9697$ vertices. The current record is due to Dudek and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{DuRo08} who proved $N\\leq 941$ vertices. For further information we refer to a paper of Radziszowski and Xu \\cite{RaXu07}, who prove that $N\\geq 19$ and speculate that $N\\leq 127$.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection and [924] for the general case.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DuRo08] Dudek, Andrzej and R\\\"{o}dl, Vojt\\vEch, On the Folkman number {$f(2,3,4)$}.
