  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1946. It is one of the most famous problems in combinatorial geometry. The unit distance problem asks for the maximum number u(n) of pairs of points at distance 1 in a set of n points in the plane. Erdős offered a $500 prize for its resolution.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every set of n distinct points in ℝ² contain at most n^{1+O(1/log log n)} pairs at unit distance?",
    "proofStrategy": "Full rewrite from formal-conjectures. Defines unit distance counting via offDiag filtering, states the Spencer–Szemerédi–Trotter O(n^{4/3}) upper bound, the lattice lower bound, the main conjecture, its weak form u(n) = n^{1+o(1)}, and Valtr's metric obstruction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The trivial upper bound C(n,2) is improved to O(n^{4/3}) via the Szemerédi–Trotter incidence theorem",
      "Lattice constructions achieve n^{1+c/log log n} unit distances, matching the conjectured bound",
      "Valtr's obstruction shows the n^{4/3} barrier cannot be broken by purely combinatorial methods",
      "Any improvement must exploit specific properties of Euclidean distance"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem 90 is one of the central questions in combinatorial geometry. The gap between the n^{4/3} upper bound and the n^{1+c/log log n} lower bound has remained open since 1946. Valtr's obstruction shows that new geometric ideas are needed.",
