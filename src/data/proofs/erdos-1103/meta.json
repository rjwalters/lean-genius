  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked how fast an infinite sequence must grow if all pairwise sums are squarefree. He doubted polynomial growth could suffice. van Doorn and Tao (2025) established both upper and lower bounds, showing the growth rate is between polynomial (j^{4/3}) and subexponential (exp(5j/log j)). Konyagin provided finite-set bounds.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be an infinite set of positive integers such that a + b is squarefree for all a, b ∈ A. Must A grow at least exponentially?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define SquarefreeSumset as the condition that all pairwise sums are squarefree, axiomatize an increasing enumeration enumSet, and state the conjecture as exponential lower bound on enumSet. Known bounds by van Doorn–Tao and Konyagin are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The squarefree sumset condition links additive combinatorics to multiplicative number theory",
      "van Doorn–Tao's polynomial lower bound j^{4/3} falls short of the conjectured exponential growth",
      "The upper bound exp(5j/log j) shows subexponential growth is achievable",
      "Konyagin's finite-set bound |A| ≪ N^{11/15} provides complementary information"
