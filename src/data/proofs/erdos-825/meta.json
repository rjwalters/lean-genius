  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Benkoski and Erdős studied weird numbers—abundant numbers that are not semiperfect. The smallest weird number is 70. Erdős asked whether sufficiently high abundancy σ(n)/n forces semiperfectness, offering a $25 prize. The problem remains open. No odd weird number is known (Erdős Problem #470).",
    "problemStatement": "Is there an absolute constant C > 0 such that every n with σ(n) > Cn is the distinct sum of proper divisors of n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines divisor sums, proper divisors, semiperfectness, and weird numbers. It axiomatises the known lower bound C > 2 (from the counterexample n = 70) and the connection to odd weird numbers. The main conjecture and the strengthened C = 3 version are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A weird number is abundant but not semiperfect; 70 is the smallest",
      "The constant C must exceed 2, as σ(70) > 2·70 but 70 is weird",
      "If no odd weird numbers exist, all weird numbers have abundancy < 4",
      "The conjectured threshold is C = 3"
