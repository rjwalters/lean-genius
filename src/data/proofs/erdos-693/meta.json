  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Paul Erdős (referenced as [Er79e]) and concerns the distribution of integers with medium-sized divisors. The question connects to classical divisor theory and sieve methods. It asks about the fine structure of how divisibility constrains the placement of integers in intervals.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 2 and n be sufficiently large. Define A as the set of integers in [n, n^k] that have a divisor in (n, 2n). Order A as a₁ < a₂ < ···. Is the maximum gap max_i(a_{i+1} - a_i) bounded by (log n)^O(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem requires estimating both the density of A and the uniformity of its distribution. Heuristically, integers with a divisor in (n, 2n) should have density ~1/log(n), suggesting average gap ~log(n). The question is whether maximum gaps stay polylogarithmic or can be much larger.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Elements of A must have a divisor d with n < d < 2n",
      "Heuristic density of A is ~1/log(n) in the range [n, n^k]",
      "Average gap analysis suggests polylog is plausible",
      "Maximum gap could exceed average due to local irregularities",
      "Related to Hooley divisor function and sieve methods"

      "content": "If d divides m, then m = d·q. For d in (n, 2n), possible values of m in [n, n^k] are d, 2d, 3d, ..., ⌊n^k/d⌋·d. Summing over all such d gives a heuristic count of |A| ~ (n^k - n)/log(n), suggesting gaps average ~log(n)."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #693 remains open. It asks whether integers with medium-sized divisors (in (n, 2n)) are densely and uniformly distributed in [n, n^k], with gaps bounded polylogarithmically.",
    "implications": "Resolution would illuminate the fine structure of divisor distribution. A positive answer confirms regularity in how divisibility constraints spread integers. A negative answer would reveal surprising clustering or gaps.",

      "Is the maximum gap bounded by C·(log n)^α for some constants?",
      "What is the density of A in [n, n^k]?",
