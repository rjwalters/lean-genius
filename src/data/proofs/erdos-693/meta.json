    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #693, from [Er79e], asks about the distribution of integers with medium-sized divisors. Related to Problem #446 and classical questions about divisor distribution, the Hooley divisor function, and sieve methods.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 2, n large. A = {m ∈ [n, n^k] : m has a divisor in (n, 2n)}, ordered as a₁ < a₂ < ···. Is max_i(a_{i+1} - a_i) ≤ C·(log n)^α for some constants C, α > 0? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines hasDivisorInInterval, setA, and proves setA is finite. Gap infrastructure (orderedA, consecutiveGaps, maxGap, maxGapA) is built. The conjecture polylogBoundedGap is defined. Proved results: setA_finite, mem_setA_has_divisor, divisor_factorization. Gap bounds and density estimates are axiomatized. Summary theorem is proved.",

      "Elements of A have a divisor d with n < d < 2n",
      "Heuristic density of A is ~1/log(n) in [n, n^k]",
