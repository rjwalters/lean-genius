    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #475** is Graham's Rearrangement Conjecture, a beautiful problem in additive combinatorics.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Graham (original):** Proved the conjecture for t = p - 1 (the full non-zero set).\n- **Costa-Pellegrini (2020):** Verified for t ≤ 12 via computation/theory.\n- **Hicks-Ollis-Schmitt (2019):** Proved for large sets (p - 3 ≤ t ≤ p - 1).\n- **Kravitz (2024):** Extended to t ≤ log p / log log p.\n- **Bedert-Kravitz (2024):** Broke the 'rectification barrier' to reach t ≤ exp((log p)^{1/4}).\n\nAlspach conjectured the same holds for arbitrary abelian groups.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $p$ be a prime. Given any finite set $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p \\setminus \\{0\\}$, is there always a rearrangement $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_t\\}$ such that all partial sums $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} a_k$ are distinct for all $1 \\leq m \\leq t$?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- $t \\leq 12$: YES (Costa-Pellegrini 2020)\n- $t \\geq p - 3$: YES (Hicks-Ollis-Schmitt 2019)\n- $t \\leq \\exp((\\log p)^{1/4})$: YES (Bedert-Kravitz 2024)\n\n**Open:** General $t$ (the gap in the middle).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Valid Orderings:** Define partial sums and what makes an ordering valid.\n\n2. **Graham's Conjecture:** State the existence of valid orderings.\n\n3. **Known Ranges:** Axiomatize results for small t, large t, and medium t.\n\n4. **Alspach Generalization:** Connect to the broader conjecture for abelian groups.\n\n5. **Technical Barriers:** Explain the rectification barrier overcome in 2024.",
