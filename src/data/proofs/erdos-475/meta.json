Given any finite set $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{F}_p\\backslash \\{0\\}$, is there always a rearrangement $A=\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_t\\}$ such that all partial sums $\\sum_{1\\leq k\\leq m}a_{k}$ are distinct, for all $1\\leq m\\leq t$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Graham, who proved it when $t=p-1$. A similar conjecture was made for arbitrary abelian groups by Alspach. Such an ordering is often called a valid ordering.\n\nThis has been proved for $t\\leq 12$ (see Costa and Pellegrini \\cite{CoPe20} and the references therein) and for $p-3\\leq t\\leq p-1$ (see Hicks, Ollis, and Schmitt \\cite{HOS19} and the references therein). Kravitz \\cite{Kr24} has proved this for\\[t \\leq \\frac{\\log p}{\\log\\log p}.\\](This was independently earlier observed by Will Sawin in a MathOverflow post.)\n\nBedert and Kravitz \\cite{BeKr24} have now proved this conjecture for\\[t \\leq e^{(\\log p)^{1/4}}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BeKr24] B.
