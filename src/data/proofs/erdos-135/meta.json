  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős conjectured that local constraints on 4-point configurations would force global distance diversity. Tao disproved this in 2024 as part of his exploration of erdosproblems.com.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊂ ℝ² be n points such that any 4 points determine at least 5 distinct distances (out of 6 possible). Must A determine ≫ n² total distinct distances?",
    "proofStrategy": "Tao uses randomized algebraic curves over finite fields. Parabolas (ax+by)² ≡ cx+dy+e (mod p) naturally avoid parallelograms. Random affine transformations and probabilistic deletion handle other forbidden 4-point patterns. The result: O(n²/√(log n)) distances with the five-distance property.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Four points have 6 pairwise distances; the 'five-distance property' requires ≥ 5 distinct",
      "Parallelograms have only 2-3 distinct distances and must be forbidden",
      "Points on parabolas automatically avoid parallelograms (algebraic constraint)",
      "Random affine transformations reduce other forbidden patterns",
      "The construction achieves O(n²/√(log n)) distances - subquadratic but not by much"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #135 is DISPROVED. Tao (2024) constructed n-point sets with the five-distance property but only O(n²/√(log n)) distinct distances, disproving the Ω(n²) conjecture.",
    "implications": "Local constraints on 4-tuples don't imply global distance diversity. The √(log n) factor matches Guth-Katz bounds, suggesting this is optimal.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact optimal bound for five-distance sets?",
      "Can the construction be made deterministic?",
      "What about higher dimensions or different forbidden patterns?"
