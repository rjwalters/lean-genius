    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in [Er90b, p. 21] asking for the precise constant c_α in F(n,α) ~ c_α log n. The probabilistic method gives Θ(log n) bounds, and α = 0 connects to diagonal Ramsey numbers. The problem generalizes to hypergraphs (Problem #161).",
    "problemStatement": "For 0 ≤ α < 1/2, does F(n, α) ~ c_α · log n for some constant c_α?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize edge 2-colorings of K_n, balanced subsets, the threshold F(n,α), the main conjecture, upper/lower bounds from probabilistic arguments, and special cases α = 0 (Ramsey) and α = 1/2 (impossible).",
