    "historicalContext": "The Erdős Matching Conjecture is one of the central problems in extremal hypergraph theory. For graphs (r=2), Erdős-Gallai (1959) solved it completely. For 3-uniform hypergraphs, Łuczak-Mieczkowska (2014) confirmed the conjecture after decades of partial progress. For r≥4, despite major advances by Frankl, Huang-Loh-Sudakov, and others, the general conjecture remains open. Two natural constructions achieve the conjectured bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n; r, k) be the maximum number of edges in an r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices containing no k pairwise disjoint edges. Conjecture: f(n; r, k) = max(C(rk-1, r), C(n, r) - C(n-k+1, r)) for all r ≥ 3.",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines r-uniform hypergraphs with a matching predicate. The function f(n;r,k) is the supremum over hypergraphs avoiding k-matchings. Two constructions provide the conjectured lower bound. Frankl's upper bound (k-1)C(n-1,r-1) is stated as an axiom. Solved cases (r=2,3) and partial results (small n, large n regimes) are captured.",

    "summary": "The Erdős Matching Conjecture predicts the exact maximum edges in an r-uniform hypergraph avoiding k disjoint edges. The formula max(C(rk-1,r), C(n,r)-C(n-k+1,r)) is proven for r=2,3 and verified in various regimes for larger r. Frankl's upper bound (k-1)C(n-1,r-1) is always true. The conjecture remains open for r ≥ 4 despite substantial partial progress.",
    "implications": "This connects to Turán-type extremal problems, the Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem, and hypergraph matching theory. A proof would unify our understanding of when hypergraphs must contain large matchings. The conjecture has applications to coding theory and combinatorial design.",
