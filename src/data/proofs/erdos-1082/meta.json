Does $A$ determine at least $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ distinct distances? In fact, must there exist a single point from which there are at least $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ distinct distances?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Szemer\\'{e}di, who proved this with $n/2$ replaced by $n/3$. More generally, Szemer\\'{e}di gave a simple proof that if there are no $k$ points on a line then some point determines $\\gg n/k$ distinct distances (a weak inverse result to the distinct distance problem [89]).\n\nThis is a stronger form of [93]. The second question is a stronger form of [982].\n\nSzemer\\'{e}di's proof is unpublished, but given in \\cite{Er75f}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er75f} Erd\\H{o}s asks whether, given $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ with no three on a line, do they determine $\\gg n$ distances? Altman proved the answer is yes if the points form the vertices of a convex polyhedron (see [660] for a stronger form of this), and Szemer\\'{e}di proved the answer is yes if there are no four points on a plane.\n\nThe stronger second question has been answered negatively by Xichuan in the comments, who gave a set of $42$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line, such that each point determines only $20$ distinct distances.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er75f] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, On some problems of elementary and combinatorial geometry.
