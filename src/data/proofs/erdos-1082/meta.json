    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1082: Distinct Distances in General Position**\n\nThis problem originates from combinatorial geometry and explores how many distinct distances must be determined by points in general position (no three collinear).\n\n**Historical Timeline:**\n- **Szemerédi (~1975):** Proved the n/3 bound - points in general position determine at least n/3 distinct distances. This was unpublished but cited in Erdős's 1975 paper. Szemerédi also proved that if no k points are collinear, some point determines ≫ n/k distances.\n- **Erdős (1975):** Conjectured the n/2 bound in \"On some problems of elementary and combinatorial geometry.\"\n- **Xichuan (2020s):** Provided a counterexample to the stronger form: 42 points where each point sees only 20 distinct distances.\n\nThe problem connects to the famous Erdős distinct distances problem, which Guth-Katz resolved in 2015 with an Ω(n/log n) bound.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Resolved)**\n\nLet $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points with no three collinear.\n\n**Question 1:** Does $A$ determine at least $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ distinct distances?\n\n**Question 2 (Stronger):** Must there exist a single point from which there are at least $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ distinct distances?\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Question 1: OPEN\n- Question 2: DISPROVED by Xichuan\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: $\\geq n/3$ distinct distances (Szemerédi)\n- Xichuan's counterexample: 42 points, each seeing only 20 distances (< 21 = ⌊42/2⌋)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Geometric Setup:** Define Point2D, distance functions, and collinearity using the cross-product determinant formula.\n\n2. **General Position:** Define inGeneralPosition as no three points collinear.\n\n3. **Distance Counting:** Define distinctDistances (all pairs) and distancesFromPoint (from one point).\n\n4. **The Conjectures:** Formally state both conjectures as propositions.\n\n5. **Main Results:**\n   - Axiomatize Szemerédi's n/3 bound\n   - Axiomatize Xichuan's counterexample\n   - Prove Conjecture2 is false using the counterexample\n\n6. **Summary:** Combine into erdos_1082_status theorem.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1082 asks whether n points in general position determine at least n/2 distinct distances. Szemerédi proved n/3 is achievable. The stronger form (single point with n/2 distances) was disproved by Xichuan with a 42-point counterexample. The total distance conjecture (n/2) remains open.",
    "implications": "**Implications**\n\n1. **Geometry-Combinatorics Interface:** The problem bridges discrete geometry and extremal combinatorics.\n\n2. **Counterexample Construction:** Xichuan's 42-point example shows sophisticated symmetric constructions can evade distance bounds.\n\n3. **Open Territory:** The gap between n/3 (proven) and n/2 (conjectured) is a fertile area for research.\n\n4. **Higher Dimensions:** The 3D analogues have different behavior depending on convexity and planarity conditions.",
