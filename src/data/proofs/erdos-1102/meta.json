  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem 1102 was posed in 1981 and concerns the interplay between sequences and squarefree numbers. A number is squarefree if no prime square divides it—equivalently, all prime exponents in its factorization are 0 or 1.\n\nErdős defined two properties based on squarefree translates:\n- **Property P:** For every n ≥ 1, only finitely many elements a ∈ A have n + a squarefree\n- **Property Q:** Infinitely many n have n + a squarefree for all a < n in A\n\nThe density of squarefree numbers is 6/π² ≈ 0.608 (this equals 1/ζ(2)), and this constant plays a central role in the resolution.\n\nvan Doorn and Tao (2025) provided complete answers to Erdős's questions about growth rates, using techniques from analytic number theory and the distribution of squarefree numbers.",
    "problemStatement": "A number is **squarefree** if not divisible by any perfect square > 1.\n\n**Property P:** For every n ≥ 1, only finitely many a ∈ A have n + a squarefree.\n\n**Property Q:** Infinitely many n have n + a squarefree for all a < n in A.\n\nHow fast must sequences A = {a₁ < a₂ < ···} with properties P or Q grow?\n\n**Answer (van Doorn-Tao 2025):**\n- P-sequences have density 0, but can decay arbitrarily slowly\n- Q-sequences have upper density ≤ 6/π², with equality achievable",
    "proofStrategy": "The resolution uses deep results from analytic number theory:\n\n**Property P:** van Doorn-Tao show that aⱼ/j → ∞ for any P-sequence. The key is that for fixed n, the density of a with n + a squarefree is positive (close to 6/π²), so P-sequences must be sparse. However, for any function f → ∞, there exist P-sequences with aⱼ/j ≤ f(j).\n\n**Property Q:** The squarefree numbers themselves form an optimal Q-sequence with density 6/π². For any Q-sequence, considering random n shows the upper density cannot exceed 6/π² (the probability that n + a is squarefree for random a < n).\n\n**Special Sequences:** The sequences 2ⁿ ± 1 and n! ± 1 grow fast enough to have property Q. Whether they have property P remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The magic constant 6/π²:** This is 1/ζ(2), the density of squarefree numbers, and appears as the optimal bound for Q-sequences.",
      "**Squarefree numbers:** Numbers not divisible by any square > 1. The sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, ... forms the canonical Q-sequence.",
      "**Property duality:** P means 'eventually few squarefree translates,' Q means 'often all translates are squarefree.' These capture opposite extremes.",
      "**Slow decay:** P-sequences must have density 0, but can approach density 0 arbitrarily slowly—a subtle existence result.",
      "**Open questions:** Do 2ⁿ - 1 or n! + 1 have property P? The fast growth makes this hard to determine."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem 1102 about growth rates of sequences defined by squarefree properties. van Doorn and Tao's 2025 resolution shows P-sequences have density 0 (but can decay arbitrarily slowly) and Q-sequences have upper density at most 6/π² (achieved by the squarefree numbers themselves).",
    "implications": "The resolution connects several areas of number theory:\n\n1. **Squarefree density:** The constant 6/π² = 1/ζ(2) appears naturally as the optimal bound.\n\n2. **Analytic techniques:** The proofs use sieve methods and probabilistic arguments about squarefree numbers.\n\n3. **Existence vs. explicit construction:** P-sequences with slow decay exist but may be hard to construct explicitly.",
