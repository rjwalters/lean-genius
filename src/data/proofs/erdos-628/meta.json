    "historicalContext": "The Erdős-Lovász Tihany Conjecture (1968) asks about the structure of K_k-free graphs with chromatic number k. Such graphs must achieve their high chromatic number through global structure rather than large cliques.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- 1968: Erdős posed the question, initially for a = b = 3\n- 1969: Brown & Jung proved the a = b = 3 case\n- 2009: Balogh, Kostochka, Prince & Stiebitz proved for quasi-line graphs and α = 2\n- 2022: Song published comprehensive survey\n\n**Key insight:** K_k-free k-chromatic graphs have rich decomposition structure.",
    "problemStatement": "**Setup:** G has χ(G) = k but no K_k (clique of size k).\n\n**Definition:** G is (a,b)-splittable if it contains vertex-disjoint subgraphs with χ ≥ a and χ ≥ b.\n\n**Question:** For a,b ≥ 2 with a + b = k + 1, is G always (a,b)-splittable?\n\n**Status:** OPEN\n- a = b = 3: PROVED (equivalent to containing two disjoint odd cycles)\n- Quasi-line graphs: PROVED\n- Independence number 2: PROVED\n- General case: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines chromatic number, clique number, K_k-free\n2. Defines (a,b)-splittability via disjoint vertex sets\n3. States the Tihany Conjecture formally\n4. States Brown-Jung theorem for a = b = 3\n5. Defines quasi-line graphs and states Balogh et al. result\n6. States result for independence number 2\n7. Connects to critical graphs and perfect graphs\n8. Shows connection to odd cycles",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #628 (the Erdős-Lovász Tihany Conjecture) is OPEN in general. The conjecture asks whether K_k-free k-chromatic graphs are (a,b)-splittable for all valid (a,b) pairs. Special cases are proven: a = b = 3 (Brown-Jung 1969), quasi-line graphs, and graphs with independence number 2 (Balogh et al. 2009).",
    "implications": "This problem connects to:\n\n1. **Graph Decomposition:** Splitting graphs into high-chromatic parts\n2. **Critical Graph Theory:** Structure of minimal k-chromatic graphs\n3. **Perfect Graph Theory:** Why perfect graphs don't need Tihany\n4. **Odd Cycles:** Role in 3-chromatic subgraphs\n5. **Extremal Graph Theory:** K_k-free graphs with high chromatic number",
