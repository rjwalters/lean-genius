Is there, for every cardinal number $m$, some graph $G_m$ of chromatic number $m$ such that every finite subgraph of $G_m$ is a subgraph of $G$?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Walter Taylor. The more general problem replaces $\\aleph_1$ with any uncountable cardinal $\\kappa$.\n\nMore generally, Erd\\H{o}s asks to characterise families $\\mathcal{F}_\\alpha$ of finite graphs such that there is a graph of chromatic number $\\aleph_\\alpha$ all of whose finite subgraphs are in $\\mathcal{F}_\\alpha$.\n\nKomj\\'{a}th \\cite{KoSh05} proved that it is consistent that the answer is no, in that there exists a graph $G$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ such that if $H$ is any graph all of whose finite subgraphs are subgraphs of $G$ then $H$ has chromatic number $\\leq \\aleph_2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[KoSh05] Komj\\'ath, P\\'{e}ter and Shelah, Saharon, Finite subgraphs of uncountably chromatic graphs.
