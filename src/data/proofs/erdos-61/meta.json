  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős–Hajnal conjecture, proposed in 1989, is one of the most important open problems in graph theory. It connects two fundamental concepts: induced subgraphs and Ramsey-type bounds.\n\nClassical Ramsey theory tells us that every graph on n vertices contains either a clique or independent set of size at least c·log(n). This logarithmic bound is tight for general graphs. However, Erdős and Hajnal conjectured that FORBIDDING a specific induced subgraph H should dramatically improve this bound to a polynomial n^c.\n\nDespite intensive study for over 35 years, the conjecture remains open. The best known general bound, due to Bucić, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour (2023), is exp(c√(log n · log log n))—still far from the conjectured polynomial.",
    "problemStatement": "**The Erdős–Hajnal Conjecture (OPEN)**\n\nFor any graph $H$, there exists a constant $c = c(H) > 0$ such that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices that does NOT contain $H$ as an induced subgraph has either:\n- A clique of size $\\geq n^c$, OR\n- An independent set of size $\\geq n^c$\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Best known bounds**:\n- Erdős-Hajnal (1989): $\\exp(c_H \\sqrt{\\log n})$\n- BNSS (2023): $\\exp(c_H \\sqrt{\\log n \\cdot \\log\\log n})$",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the conjecture and its partial results:\n\n1. **IsErdosHajnalLowerBound**: A predicate capturing when function f is a valid lower bound for graph H\n\n2. **ErdosHajnalConjecture**: The statement that polynomial bounds always exist\n\n3. **Axioms for partial results**: We state the 1989 and 2023 bounds as axioms, since their proofs require probabilistic combinatorics beyond current Mathlib\n\n4. **Example graphs**: We define concrete small graphs (triangle, 3-path) to make the definitions testable",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Induced subgraph**: H is induced in G if we find H by selecting vertices and keeping EXACTLY their edges—no extra edges, no missing edges. This is stronger than just being a subgraph.",
      "**Why Ramsey bounds are weak**: Random graphs show that log(n) is the best general bound. The conjecture says structure (forbidding H) should help.",
      "**The polynomial gap**: The best known bound exp(c√(log n · log log n)) is still exponentially smaller than the conjectured n^c. For n = 10^6, this is roughly 30 vs 10000.",
      "**Known special cases**: The conjecture is proved for paths, cycles, complete bipartite graphs, and graphs on ≤5 vertices. These proofs often use clever structural arguments.",
      "**Connection to Ramsey theory**: This conjecture would imply new bounds for many Ramsey-type problems. Its resolution would be a major breakthrough."
