This was improved by Buci\\'{c}, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour \\cite{BNSS23} to\\[\\geq \\exp(c_H\\sqrt{\\log n\\log\\log n}).\\]See also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BNSS23] Buci\\'C, M. and Nguyen, T. and Scott, A. and Seymour, P., A loglog step towards Erdos-Hajnal. arXiv:2301.10147 (2023).\n\n[ErHa89] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A., Ramsey-type theorems.
