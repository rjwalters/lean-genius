    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $\\alpha\\in[0,1/2)$ and $n,t\\geq 1$. Let $F^{(t)}(n,\\alpha)$ be the largest $m$ such that we can $2$-colour the edges of the complete $t$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that if $X\\subseteq [n]$ with $\\lvert X\\rvert \\geq m$ then there are at least $\\alpha \\binom{\\lvert X\\rvert}{t}$ many $t$-subsets of $X$ of each colour.\n\nFor fixed $n,t$ as we change $\\alpha$ from $0$ to $1/2$ does $F^{(t)}(n,\\alpha)$ increase continuously or are there jumps? Only one jump?\n\n\n\nFor $\\alpha=0$ this is the usual Ramsey function. A conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Rado (see [562]) implies that\\[ F^{(t)}(n,0)\\asymp \\log_{t-1} n\\]and results of Erd\\H{o}s and Spencer imply that\\[F^{(t)}(n,\\alpha) \\gg_\\alpha (\\log n)^{\\frac{1}{t-1}}\\]for all $\\alpha>0$, and a similar upper bound holds for $\\alpha$ close to $1/2$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s believed there might be just one jump, occcurring at $\\alpha=0$.\n\nConlon, Fox, and Sudakov \\cite{CFS11} have proved that, for any fixed $\\alpha>0$,\\[F^{(3)}(n,\\alpha) \\ll_\\alpha \\sqrt{\\log n}.\\]Coupled with the lower bound above, this implies that there is only one jump for fixed $\\alpha$ when $t=3$, at $\\alpha=0$.\n\nFor all $\\alpha>0$ it is known that\\[F^{(t)}(n,\\alpha)\\gg_t (\\log n)^{c_\\alpha}.\\]See also [563].\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFS11] Conlon, David and Fox, Jacob and Sudakov, Benny, Large almost monochromatic subsets in hypergraphs.
