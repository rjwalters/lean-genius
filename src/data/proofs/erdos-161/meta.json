  "description": "Does F^(t)(n,α) have jumps as α varies from 0 to 1/2? SOLVED for t=3 by Conlon-Fox-Sudakov (2011): exactly one jump at α=0. F^(t)(n,α) measures the largest m ensuring every large subset has balanced colors.",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This $500 prize problem asks about the continuity of a function F^(t)(n,α) that interpolates between Ramsey-type problems (α=0) and balanced coloring problems (α near 1/2). The α=0 case connects to the Erdős-Hajnal-Rado conjecture on hypergraph Ramsey numbers, while positive α requires different techniques.",
    "problemStatement": "Let α ∈ [0,1/2) and n, t ≥ 1. Define F^(t)(n,α) as the largest m such that we can 2-color the t-uniform complete hypergraph on n vertices so that every subset X with |X| ≥ m has at least α·C(|X|,t) many t-subsets of each color. Question: As α varies from 0 to 1/2, does F^(t)(n,α) increase continuously or are there jumps?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization captures: (1) Complete t-uniform hypergraph definitions and 2-colorings. (2) The balanced coloring property and the function F. (3) The α=0 case (Ramsey, iterated log growth). (4) The α>0 case (Erdős-Spencer lower bounds). (5) The main result for t=3 (Conlon-Fox-Sudakov). (6) The jump characterization showing dramatic difference between α=0 and α>0.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "At α=0, F^(t)(n,0) ≈ log_{t-1}(n) (iterated logarithm—very slow growth)",
      "At α>0, F^(t)(n,α) ≈ (log n)^{1/(t-1)} (power of log—much faster)",
      "Conlon-Fox-Sudakov (2011): For t=3, F^(3)(n,α) = Θ(√(log n)) for all α>0",
      "This confirms Erdős's belief of exactly one jump at α=0 (for t=3)",
      "The jump reflects a phase transition between Ramsey-type and balanced-coloring behavior"
