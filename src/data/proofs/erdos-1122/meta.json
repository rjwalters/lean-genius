  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from Erdős's 1946 work on additive functions. An additive function f satisfies f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1. The canonical example is f(n) = c·log(n). Erdős proved that if f is strictly increasing (no defects), or if increments f(n+1) - f(n) → 0, then f must be logarithmic. The conjecture asks whether merely having sparse defects (o(X) of them up to X) suffices. Mangerel made significant progress in 2022, proving the result when defects are O(X/(log X)^{2+c}).",
    "problemStatement": "Let f: ℕ → ℝ be an additive function (f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1). Define A = {n ≥ 1 : f(n+1) < f(n)} as the monotonicity defect set. If |A ∩ [1,X]| = o(X), must f(n) = c·log(n) for some c ∈ ℝ?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines additive functions, the defect set, and little-o density conditions. Known results are axiomatized: Erdős's theorems for empty defects and vanishing increments, and Mangerel's 2022 theorem for stronger density bounds. The main conjecture is stated and marked as open. Examples include log(n) (has empty defect) and ω(n) (prime factors function, additive but not logarithmic).",

      "log(n) is the unique (up to scaling) completely additive monotone function",
      "Empty defect ⊂ Mangerel density ⊂ o(X) defects forms a strict hierarchy",
