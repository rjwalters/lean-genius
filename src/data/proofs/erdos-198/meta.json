We choose $a_1$ to be the minimal element of $P_1\\cap \\mathbb{N}$, and in general choose $a_n$ to be an element of $P_n\\cap \\mathbb{N}$ such that $a_n>2a_{n-1}$. By construction $A=\\{a_1<a_2<\\cdots\\}$ contains at least one element from every infinite arithmetic progression, and is a lacunary set, so is certainly Sidon.\n\nAlphaProof has found the following explicit construction:\\[A = \\{ (n+1)!+n : n\\geq 0\\}.\\]This is a Sidon set, and intersects every arithmetic progression, since for any $a,d\\in \\mathbb{N}$,\\[(a+d+1)!+(a+d)\\in A,\\]and $d$ divides $(a+d+1)!+d$.\n\nSee also [199].\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ba75] Baumgartner, James E., Partitioning vector spaces.
