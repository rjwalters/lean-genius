Does $f(n)/\\sqrt{n}\\to \\infty$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Pach. The lower bound $f(n)\\geq (1-o(1))\\sqrt{n}$ follows from the fact that a graph with maximum degree $d$ and diameter $2$ has at most $1+d+d(d-1)=d^2+1$ many vertices.\n\nSimonovits observed that the subsets of $[3m-1]$ of size $m$, two sets joined by edge if and only if they are disjoint, forms a triangle-free graph of diameter $2$ which is regular of degree $\\binom{2m-1}{m}$. This construction proves that\\[f(n) \\leq n^{(1+o(1))\\frac{2}{3H(1/3)}}=n^{0.7182\\cdots},\\]where $H(x)$ is the binary entropy function. In \\cite{Er97b} Erd\\H{o}s encouraged the reader to try and find a better construction.\n\nIn this note Alon provides a simple construction that proves $f(n) \\ll \\sqrt{n\\log n}$: take a triangle-free graph with independence number $\\ll \\sqrt{n\\log n}$ (the existence of which is the lower bound in [165]) and add edges until it has diameter $2$; the neighbourhood of any set is an independent set and hence the maximum degree is still $\\ll \\sqrt{n\\log n}$.\n\nHanson and Seyffarth \\cite{HaSe84} proved that $f(n)\\leq (\\sqrt{2}+o(1))\\sqrt{n}$ using a Cayley graph on $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, with the generating set given by some symmetric complete sum-free set of size $\\sim \\sqrt{n}$. An alternative construction of such a complete sum-free set was given by Haviv and Levy \\cite{HaLe18}.\n\nF\\\"{u}redi and Seress \\cite{FuSe94} proved that $f(n)\\leq (\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}+o(1))\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nThe precise asymptotics of $f(n)$ are unknown; Alon believes that the truth is $f(n)\\sim \\sqrt{n}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er97b] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some old and new problems in various branches of combinatorics.
