    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #133** was posed by Erdős and Pach concerning the structure of triangle-free graphs with diameter 2.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Erdős-Pach (original):** Posed the question of whether f(n)/√n → ∞.\n- **1984 (Hanson-Seyffarth):** Proved f(n) ≤ (√2 + o(1))√n using Cayley graphs on ℤ/nℤ with complete sum-free generating sets.\n- **1994 (Füredi-Seress):** Improved to f(n) ≤ (2/√3 + o(1))√n ≈ 1.1547√n.\n- **Alon:** Gave a simple proof that f(n) ≪ √(n log n) using triangle-free graphs with small independence number.\n- **Simonovits:** Earlier construction using Kneser-like graphs gave f(n) ≤ n^0.7182.\n\nThe problem was **DISPROVED**: f(n)/√n does NOT tend to infinity. Instead, f(n) = Θ(√n), and Alon conjectures f(n) ~ √n exactly.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED/DISPROVED)**\n\nLet $f(n)$ be minimal such that every triangle-free graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and diameter $2$ contains a vertex with degree $\\geq f(n)$.\n\n**Original Question:** What is the order of growth of $f(n)$? Does $f(n)/\\sqrt{n} \\to \\infty$?\n\n**Answer:** NO. The ratio $f(n)/\\sqrt{n}$ is bounded.\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- **Lower:** $f(n) \\geq (1-o(1))\\sqrt{n}$ (from Moore bound: max-degree-$d$ diameter-2 graph has $\\leq d^2+1$ vertices)\n- **Upper:** $f(n) \\leq (2/\\sqrt{3}+o(1))\\sqrt{n} \\approx 1.1547\\sqrt{n}$ (Füredi-Seress 1994)\n\n**Open:** What is the exact asymptotic of $f(n)$? Alon conjectures $f(n) \\sim \\sqrt{n}$.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define triangle-free property and diameter-2 condition using Mathlib's SimpleGraph.\n\n2. **f(n) Function:** Define as the minimum guaranteed maximum degree over all valid graphs.\n\n3. **Moore Bound:** Axiomatize that diameter-2 graphs with max degree d have at most d² + 1 vertices, giving the lower bound.\n\n4. **Upper Bound Constructions:** Axiomatize the various constructions (Simonovits, Alon, Hanson-Seyffarth, Füredi-Seress).\n\n5. **Main Result:** Show the original question is disproved by the bounded ratio, and state Alon's conjecture.",
