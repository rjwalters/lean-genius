  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this problem in their 1980 monograph. Graham showed that the completeness region has a surprisingly complex structure: for some t, the set of good α consists of multiple disjoint intervals. The conjecture that α < golden ratio suffices remains one of the deepest open questions in combinatorial number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "For what values of t, α ∈ (0,∞) is the sequence ⌊tα^n⌋ complete (all sufficiently large integers representable as sums of distinct terms)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define additive completeness, the exponential floor sequence, and good pairs. We state the golden ratio conjecture, Graham's disjoint segments result, and the fundamental parity questions for ⌊(3/2)^n⌋.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Conjectured complete for 1 < α < (1+√5)/2 (golden ratio)",
      "Graham showed the completeness set has ≥ k disjoint intervals for any k",
      "Whether ⌊(3/2)^n⌋ is odd/even infinitely often is a fundamental obstacle",
      "The golden ratio threshold connects to Fibonacci completeness",
      "Even basic parity questions about exponential floors are intractable"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #349 asks for the complete characterization of pairs (t,α) making ⌊tα^n⌋ a complete sequence. The conjectured golden ratio threshold and the intractable parity questions for ⌊(3/2)^n⌋ highlight the profound difficulty of understanding exponential floor sequences.",
    "implications": "Resolution would advance our understanding of completeness in additive number theory and the distribution of fractional parts of exponential sequences, with connections to Waring's problem and uniform distribution theory.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is ⌊tα^n⌋ complete for all t > 0 and 1 < α < (1+√5)/2?",
