Estimate $g(n)$.\n\n\n\nEquivalently, how many triangles of area $1$ can a set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ determine? Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy attribute this question to Oppenheim. Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy \\cite{ErPu71} proved\\[n^2\\log\\log n \\ll g(n) \\ll n^{5/2},\\]and believed the lower bound to be closer to the truth. The upper bound has been improved a number of times - by Pach and Sharir \\cite{PaSh92}, Dumitrescu, Sharir, and T\\'{o}th \\cite{DST09}, Apfelbaum and Sharir \\cite{ApSh10}, and Apfaulbaum \\cite{Ap13}. The best known bound is\\[g(n) \\ll n^{20/9}\\]by Raz and Sharir \\cite{RaSh17}.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Purdy also ask a similar question about the higher-dimensional generalisations - more generally, let $g_d^{r}(n)$ be minimal such that any set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ contains the vertices of at most $g_d^{r}(n)$ many $r$-dimensional simplices with the same volume.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Purdy \\cite{ErPu71} proved $g_3^2(n) \\ll n^{8/3}$, and Dumitrescu, Sharir, and T\\'{o}th \\cite{DST09} improved this to $g_3^2(n) \\ll n^{2.4286}$.\nErd\\H{o}s and Purdy \\cite{ErPu71} proved $g_6^2(n)\\gg n^3$. Purdy \\cite{Pu74} proved\\[g_4^2(n)\\leq g^2_5(n) \\ll n^{3-c}\\]for some constant $c>0$. An observation of Oppenheim (using a construction of Lenz) detailed in \\cite{ErPu71} shows that\\[g_{2k+2}^k(n)\\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{(k+1)^{k+1}}+o(1)\\right)n^{k+1}\\]and Erd\\H{o}s and Purdy conjecture this is the best possible.\n\nSee also [90] and [755].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ap13] R.
