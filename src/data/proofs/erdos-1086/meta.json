  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1086**\n\nThis problem concerns counting triangles with equal area formed by points in the plane, a fundamental question in discrete geometry.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Oppenheim: Original question (attributed by Erdős-Purdy)\n- Erdős-Purdy (1971): First bounds n² log log n ≪ g(n) ≪ n^(5/2)\n- Pach-Sharir (1992), DST (2009), Apfelbaum-Sharir (2010): Progressive improvements\n- Raz-Sharir (2017): Current best upper bound n^(20/9)\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nThe function g(n) measures the maximum number of triangles with the same area that any n-point configuration can determine. Understanding this function relates to incidence geometry and the structure of point configurations.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $g(n)$ be minimal such that any set of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ contains the vertices of at most $g(n)$ triangles with the same area.\n\nEstimate $g(n)$.\n\n**Current Bounds:**\n- Lower: $n^2 \\log\\log n \\ll g(n)$ (Erdős-Purdy, 1971)\n- Upper: $g(n) \\ll n^{20/9}$ (Raz-Sharir, 2017)\n\n**Conjecture:** Erdős and Purdy believed the lower bound closer to the truth, suggesting $g(n) = \\Theta(n^2 \\log\\log n)$.\n\nThe gap between exponents 2 and 20/9 ≈ 2.222 remains open.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Functions:** Define triangleAreaCount and maxEqualAreaTriangles (g(n))\n\n2. **Known Bounds:**\n   - erdos_purdy_lower_bound: g(n) ≫ n² log log n\n   - raz_sharir_2017: g(n) ≪ n^(20/9)\n\n3. **Conjecture:** erdosPurdyConjecture formalizes the believed tight bound\n\n4. **Higher Dimensions:** maxEqualVolumeSimplex generalizes to g_d^r(n)\n\n5. **Constructions:** oppenheim_lenz_lower gives lower bounds in high dimensions\n\nThe problem is captured as having known bounds but remaining open.",
