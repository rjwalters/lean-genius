  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Bose to Erdős. A B₃ set has all ordered triple sums distinct. Bose and Chowla (1962) constructed B₃ sets of size (1+o(1))N^{1/3} using finite field methods. Green (2001) proved the upper bound f(N) ≤ (7/2)^{1/3}·N^{1/3} ≈ 1.519·N^{1/3}. The gap between 1 and 1.519 remains open. This generalizes the Sidon set problem (B₂ sets, Problem #30). Discussed as Problem C11 in Guy's collection.",
    "problemStatement": "Is f(N) ~ N^{1/3}, where f(N) is the maximum size of a B₃ subset of {1,...,N}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsB3 (all ordered triple sums distinct) and maxB3Size. The conjecture ErdosProblem241 asserts f(N)/N^{1/3} → 1. We axiomatize the Bose–Chowla lower bound and Green's upper bound. The generalized Bₕ sets and Bose–Chowla conjecture for arbitrary h are formalized.",
