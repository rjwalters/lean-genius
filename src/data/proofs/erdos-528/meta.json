    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #528: Connective Constant for Self-Avoiding Walks**\n\nA self-avoiding walk (SAW) is a path on a lattice that never revisits any vertex — this models polymers in chemistry and physics. The connective constant C_k = lim f(n,k)^{1/n} measures the exponential growth rate of the number of n-step SAWs in ℤ^k.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Hammersley-Morton (1954):** Proved the limit C_k exists using submultiplicativity (f(m+n,k) ≤ f(m,k)·f(n,k)) and Fekete's lemma\n- **Kesten (1963):** Proved the asymptotic C_k = 2k-1 - 1/(2k) + O(1/k²), showing C_k is close to 2k-1 for large k\n- **Conway-Guttmann (1993):** Rigorous lower bound C_2 ≥ 2.62\n- **Alm (1993):** Rigorous upper bound C_2 ≤ 2.696\n- **Duminil-Copin-Smirnov (2012):** Proved the exact value μ_honeycomb = √(2+√2) for the honeycomb lattice, contributing to Smirnov's Fields Medal\n- **Jacobsen-Scullard-Guttmann (2016):** High-precision computation C_2 = 2.6381585303279... to 12+ decimal places\n\n**Key Insight:** The submultiplicativity of SAW counts is the crucial property guaranteeing the limit exists — it follows because concatenating two SAWs at the origin gives a walk that is at least as constrained as the two original walks.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $f(n,k)$ count self-avoiding walks of $n$ steps starting at the origin in $\\mathbb{Z}^k$.\n\n**Question:** Determine the connective constant:\n$$C_k = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f(n,k)^{1/n}$$\n\n**Known Results:**\n- Limit exists (Hammersley-Morton 1954)\n- Bounds: $k \\leq C_k \\leq 2k-1$\n- Kesten's asymptotic: $C_k = 2k-1 - \\frac{1}{2k} + O(k^{-2})$\n- 2D value: $C_2 = 2.6381585303279...$ (numerical, 12+ digits)\n- 2D bounds: $2.62 \\leq C_2 \\leq 2.696$ (rigorous)\n- Honeycomb: $\\mu_{\\text{hex}} = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}$ (exact, Duminil-Copin/Smirnov)\n\n**Status:** OPEN — exact closed forms unknown for all $k$",

      "**Submultiplicativity is Key:** f(m+n,k) ≤ f(m,k)·f(n,k) implies the limit exists by Fekete's lemma — concatenating SAWs gives an upper bound because the concatenation may not be self-avoiding",
