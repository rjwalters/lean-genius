Determine\\[C_k=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(n,k)^{1/n}.\\]\n\n\n\nThe constant $C_k$ is sometimes known as the connective constant. Hammersley and Morton \\cite{HM54} showed that this limit exists, and it is trivial that $k\\leq C_k\\leq 2k-1$.\n\nKesten \\cite{Ke63} proved that $C_k=2k-1-1/2k+O(1/k^2)$, and more precise asymptotics are given by Clisby, Liang, and Slade \\cite{CLS07}.\n\nConway and Guttmann \\cite{CG93} showed that $C_2\\geq 2.62$ and Alm \\cite{Al93} showed that $C_2\\leq 2.696$. Jacobsen, Scullard, and Guttmann \\cite{JSG16} have computed the first few decimal places of $C_2$, showing that\\[C_2 = 2.6381585303279\\cdots.\\]See also [529].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al93] Alm, Sven Erick, Upper bounds for the connective constant of self-avoiding\nwalks.
