  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns lacunary power series - series f(z) = ∑ aₖz^{nₖ} where the exponents have gaps. The question of how these gaps affect value distribution goes back to the early 20th century.\n\nFejér (1908) proved that if ∑1/nₖ < ∞, the function assumes every value at least once. Biernacki (1928) strengthened this to show every value is assumed infinitely often under the same condition.\n\nThe Fejér-Pólya conjecture asks whether the weaker Fabry gap condition (nₖ/k → ∞) is sufficient. Pólya (1929) proved partial results for functions of finite order, but the general case remains open. This is a fundamental question connecting gap conditions in power series to complex function theory.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Fejér-Pólya)**: Let $f(z) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} a_k z^{n_k}$ be an entire function with $a_k \\neq 0$. If the exponents satisfy the **Fabry gap condition** $n_k/k \\to \\infty$, does $f(z)$ assume every complex value infinitely often?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Related Result (Biernacki 1928)**: Under the stronger **Fejér gap condition** $\\sum 1/n_k < \\infty$, the answer is YES.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize both the open conjecture and the related solved result:\n\n1. **Gap Conditions**: Define HasFabryGaps (nₖ/k → ∞) and HasFejerGaps (∑1/nₖ < ∞)\n\n2. **Hierarchy**: Prove that Fejér gaps imply Fabry gaps (the converse is false)\n\n3. **Open Conjecture**: State the Fabry gap conjecture as a Prop that can be true or false\n\n4. **Biernacki's Theorem**: State the solved Fejér gap case as an axiom, since the complex analysis proof is beyond current Mathlib\n\n5. **Example**: Verify that nₖ = 2^k has Fejér gaps, demonstrating the applicability of Biernacki's theorem",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Lacunary series**: Power series with gaps in exponents have special properties. The 'density' of gaps determines value distribution behavior.",
      "**Gap hierarchy**: Fejér gaps (∑1/nₖ < ∞) ⊂ Fabry gaps (nₖ/k → ∞). The former is easier to analyze but more restrictive.",
      "**Value distribution**: Picard's theorem says entire functions miss at most one value. Gap conditions can force every value to be assumed infinitely often.",
      "**The gap**: Despite 100+ years of study, we don't know if the weaker Fabry condition suffices for infinite value coverage."
