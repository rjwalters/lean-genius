Is there a constant $c$ such that\\[F(n)=\\pi(n)+(c+o(1))n^{3/4}(\\log n)^{-3/2}?\\]If $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ is such that all products $a_1\\cdots a_r$ are distinct for $a_1<\\cdots <a_r$ then is it true that\\[\\lvert A\\rvert \\leq \\pi(n)+O(n^{\\frac{r+1}{2r}})?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er68} proved that there exist some constants $0<c_1\\leq c_2$ such that\\[\\pi(n)+c_1 n^{3/4}(\\log n)^{-3/2}\\leq F(n)\\leq \\pi(n)+c_2 n^{3/4}(\\log n)^{-3/2}.\\]This problem can also be considered in the real numbers: that is, what is the size of the the largest $A\\subset [1,x]$ such that for any distinct $a,b,c,d\\in A$ we have $\\lvert ab-cd\\rvert \\geq 1$? Erd\\H{o}s had conjectured (see \\cite{Er73} and \\cite{Er77c}) that $\\lvert A\\rvert=o(x)$.\n\nIn \\cite{ErGr80} Erd\\H{o}s and Graham report that Alexander had given a construction disproving this conjecture, establishing that $\\lvert A\\rvert\\gg x$ is possible. Alexander's construction is given in \\cite{Er80}, and we sketch a simplified version. Let $B\\subseteq [1,X^2]$ be a Sidon set of integers of size $\\gg X$ and\\[A=\\{ X e^{b/X^2} : b\\in B\\}.\\]It is easy to check that\\[\\lvert ab-cd\\rvert \\geq X^2\\lvert 1-e^{1/X^2}\\rvert \\gg 1\\]for distinct $a,b,c,d\\in A$, and (after rescaling $A$ by some constant factor) this produces a set of size $\\gg X$ with the desired property in the interval $[X,O(X)]$. Furthermore, a simple modification allows for $A$ to also be $1$-separated.\n\nIn \\cite{Er77c} Erd\\H{o}s considers a similar generalisation for sets of complex numbers or complex integers.\n\n\nSee also [490], [793], and [796].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er68] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On some applications of graph theory to number theoretic problems.
