  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Gyárfás asked for the minimum colors to edge-color Kₙ so every K₄ uses at least 5 of its 6 edges distinctly colored. They proved bounds and Erdős conjectured the lower bound was tight. This was confirmed by Bennett et al. (2022) and independently by Joos-Mubayi.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be the smallest number of colors needed to color edges of Kₙ such that every K₄ contains at least 5 different colors. Determine f(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines edge colorings, the constraint 'every K₄ has ≥5 colors', and states f(n) as the minimum. The asymptotic f(n) ~ (5/6)n is axiomatized from the 2022 results.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "K₄ has C(4,2) = 6 edges, requiring ≥5 colors means at most 1 repeated color",
      "The fraction 5/6 naturally arises as 1 - 1/6 (one 'defect' allowed)",
      "Erdős-Gyárfás bounds: (5/6)(n-1) < f(n) < n",
      "Bennett et al. and Joos-Mubayi proved f(n) ~ (5/6)n - the lower bound is tight"
