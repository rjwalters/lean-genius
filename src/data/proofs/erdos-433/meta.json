Let\\[g(k,n)=\\max G(A)\\]where the maximum is taken over all $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ of size $\\lvert A\\rvert=k$ which has no common divisor. Is it true that\\[g(k,n)\\sim \\frac{n^2}{k-1}?\\]\n\n\n\nThis type of problem is associated with Frobenius (see also [434]). Erd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{ErGr72} proved $g(k,n)<2n^2/k$, and there are examples which show that\\[g(k,n) \\geq \\frac{n^2}{k-1}-5n\\]for $k\\geq 2$.\n\nThe problem is written as Erd\\H{o}s and Graham describe it, but presumably they had in mind the regime where $k$ is fixed and $n\\to \\infty$.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Dixmier \\cite{Di90}, who proved that in fact, for all $2\\leq k<n$,\\[\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-2}{k-1}\\right\\rfloor(n-k+1)-1\\leq g(k,n) \\leq \\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{k-1}\\right\\rfloor-1\\right)n-1,\\]and determined $g(k,n)$ exactly when $k-1$ divides any of $n,n-1,n-2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Di90] Dixmier, Jacques, Proof of a conjecture by {E}rd\\H{o}s and {G}raham concerning\nthe problem of {F}robenius.
