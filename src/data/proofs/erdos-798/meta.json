    "summary": "Erdos Problem #798 asked whether t(n) = o(n), where t(n) is the minimum points needed to cover {1,...,n}^2 with the lines they determine. The answer is YES. Alon (1991) proved t(n) = Theta(n^{2/3} log n), which is indeed o(n). The lower bound n^{2/3} comes from a simple counting argument; the upper bound uses sophisticated constructions.",
    "implications": "**Geometric and Combinatorial Significance**\n\n1. **Efficient Coverage:** Sublinear points can cover a quadratic grid\n\n2. **Line Geometry:** Demonstrates power of lines in discrete geometry\n\n3. **Probabilistic Methods:** Alon's proof is a success of probabilistic combinatorics\n\n4. **Open Question:** Is the log n factor in the upper bound necessary?",
