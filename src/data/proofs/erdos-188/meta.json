  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This Euclidean Ramsey theory problem was studied by Erdos, Graham, Montgomery, Rothschild, Spencer, and Straus [EGMRSS75]. The original formulation asked about arbitrary APs in blue, but Noga Alon showed this has no solution via van der Waerden's theorem.\n\nThe correct formulation restricts to APs with unit distance steps. The lower bound k >= 5 was established by EGMRSS, improved to k >= 6 by Tsaturian in 2017. Erdos and Graham claimed k <= 10,000,000 without detailed proof.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nFind the smallest constant k such that the plane R^2 can be 2-colored (red/blue) where:\n1. No two red points are at unit distance apart\n2. No k-term arithmetic progression of blue points has distance 1 between consecutive terms\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: k >= 6 (Tsaturian 2017)\n- Upper: k <= 10,000,000 (Erdos-Graham)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Coloring:** PlaneColoring := C -> Bool (using complex plane)\n\n2. **Constraints:** RedUnitDistanceFree and BlueContainsUnitAP\n\n3. **Achievable Set:** s = {k | exists valid coloring}\n\n4. **Bounds:** Axiomatize lower (6) and upper (10^7) bounds\n\n5. **Unit Distance Graph:** Connect to graph independence",

      "**Alon's Observation:** Original problem (any AP) has no solution due to van der Waerden",
      "**Unit Distance Restriction:** The key is requiring AP steps of length exactly 1",
      "**Lower Bound 6:** Tsaturian (2017) improved EGMRSS bound from 5 to 6",
