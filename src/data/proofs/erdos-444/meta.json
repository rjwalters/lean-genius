  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "From Erdős and Graham's 'Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory' (1980), page 88. The problem studies the relationship between restricted divisor functions and partial harmonic sums. Erdős and Sárközy resolved it in their paper 'Some asymptotic formulas on generalized divisor functions IV'.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊆ ℕ be infinite and d_A(n) count the number of elements of A that divide n. Is it true that for every k, limsup_{x→∞} max_{n<x} d_A(n) / (∑_{a∈A, a<x} 1/a)^k = ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the generalized divisor function d_A, the partial harmonic sum H_A, and the maximum M_A. The main theorem states that for any infinite A and any k ≥ 1, M_A(x) eventually exceeds any multiple of H_A(x)^k. Special cases include A = ℕ (standard divisors) and A = primes (prime omega function).",

      "Highly composite numbers relative to A provide extremal examples",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #444 was SOLVED by Erdős and Sárközy in 1980. The answer is YES: for any infinite A ⊆ ℕ and any k ≥ 1, the maximum of the restricted divisor function d_A grows faster than any fixed power of the partial harmonic sum H_A. This reveals a fundamental extremal property of divisor functions.",
    "implications": "The result shows that the maximum divisor count cannot be uniformly bounded by any power of the 'density' measure given by the harmonic sum. This has implications for understanding highly divisible numbers and multiplicative function extrema.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the precise growth rate of M_A(x) in terms of H_A(x) for specific classes of A?",
      "How does the rate of divergence depend on the structure of A?",
      "Are there effective versions with explicit constants?"
