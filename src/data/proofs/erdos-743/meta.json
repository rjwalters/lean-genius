Can we always write $K_n$ as the edge disjoint union of the $T_k$?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, known as the tree packing conjecture.\n\nGy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s and Lehel \\cite{GyLe78} proved that this holds if all but at most $2$ of the trees are stars, or if all the trees are stars or paths. Fishburn \\cite{Fi83} proved this for $n\\leq 9$. Bollob\\'{a}s \\cite{Bo83} proved that the smallest $\\lfloor n/\\sqrt{2}\\rfloor$ many trees can always be packed greedily into $K_n$.\n\nJoos, Kim, K\\\"{u}hn, and Osthus \\cite{JKKO19} proved that this conjecture holds when the trees have bounded maximum degree. Allen, B\\\"{o}ttcher, Clemens, Hladky, Piguet, and Taraz \\cite{ABCHPT21} proved that this conjecture holds when all the trees have maximum degree $\\leq c\\frac{n}{\\log n}$ for some constant $c>0$.\n\nJanzer and Montgomery \\cite{JaMo24} have proved that there exists some $c>0$ such that the largest $cn$ trees can be packed into $K_n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ABCHPT21] Allen, Peter and B\\\"ottcher, Julia and Clemens, Dennis and Hladky, J. and D.
