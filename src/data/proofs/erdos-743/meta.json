(2021): Proved for max degree ≤ cn/log n\n- Janzer-Montgomery (2024): Proved largest cn trees can be packed\n\n**Edge Count Verification:**\nThe conjecture is consistent because:\nΣ(k-1) for k=2 to n = 1+2+...+(n-1) = n(n-1)/2 = |E(Kₙ)|",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $T_2, T_3, \\ldots, T_n$ be a collection of trees where $T_k$ has exactly $k$ vertices. Can we always write $K_n$ as the edge-disjoint union of the $T_k$?\n\n**Known Special Cases:**\n- Stars and paths: Yes (Gyárfás-Lehel 1978)\n- All but ≤2 trees are stars: Yes (Gyárfás-Lehel 1978)\n- n ≤ 9: Yes (Fishburn 1983)\n- Bounded max degree Δ: Yes for large n (JKKO 2019)\n- Max degree ≤ cn/log n: Yes (Allen et al. 2021)\n\n**Partial Packing:**\n- Smallest ⌊n/√2⌋ trees: Can be packed greedily (Bollobás 1983)\n- Largest cn trees: Can be packed (Janzer-Montgomery 2024)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Structures:**\n   - Tree (k): Structure with connected, edgeCount, acyclic\n   - TreeCollection (n): Collection T₂,...,Tₙ\n   - EdgeDisjointPacking: Can pack into Kₙ\n\n2. **Special Tree Types:**\n   - IsStar, IsPath, IsCaterpillar predicates\n   - BoundedDegreeCollection for degree bounds\n\n3. **Key Results as Axioms:**\n   - gyarfas_lehel_stars_paths, fishburn_small_n\n   - bollobas_greedy, jkko_bounded_degree\n   - janzer_montgomery_large_trees\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - edge_counts_match: Necessary condition\n   - complete_graph_edges_small: Concrete values",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Edge Count:** The total edges in T₂,...,Tₙ exactly equals |E(Kₙ)| = n(n-1)/2, a necessary condition",
      "**Stars/Paths:** The simplest trees (stars and paths) satisfy the conjecture, suggesting structure matters",
      "**Degree Constraint:** Bounded degree trees are easier; high-degree vertices create packing challenges",
      "**Greedy vs Full:** Bollobás shows greedy works for small trees; Janzer-Montgomery handles large trees separately",
      "**Middle Gap:** Trees of intermediate size (roughly 0.7n to (1-c)n vertices) remain the hardest case"
