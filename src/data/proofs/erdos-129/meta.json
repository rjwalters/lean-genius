  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Gyárfás proposed this conjecture about Ramsey-type numbers R(n;k,r) for avoiding monochromatic cliques. They proved the lower bound R(n;3,r) > C^{√n}. The upper bound remains open. Girão noted that the original formulation may be ambiguous. Reference: [Er97b].",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist C > 1 (depending on r) such that R(n;3,r) < C^{√n}? More generally, are there C₁,C₂ > 1 with C₁^{n^{1/(k-1)}} < R(n;k,r) < C₂^{n^{1/(k-1)}}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define EdgeColoring as functions from ordered pairs to Fin r, AvoidsMono and NoMonoClique for the clique-avoidance property, and HasRamseyAvoid as the universal quantification over colorings. The conjecture is stated parametrically in k and r, with a specialization for k=3.",
