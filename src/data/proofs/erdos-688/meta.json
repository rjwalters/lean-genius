  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in 1979, exploring how efficiently large primes can cover intervals via congruence classes. Each prime p covers ~n/p integers with one class. The question is whether primes near n (i.e., p > n^ε with ε → 0) suffice.",
    "problemStatement": "Define εₙ as the maximum ε for which one residue class per prime in (n^ε, n] covers [1, n]. Is εₙ = o(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize covering assignments, the covering interval condition, εₙ, the main conjecture, Erdős's lower bound, and structural properties via Mertens' theorem.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Each prime p covers ~n/p integers in [1,n] with one class",
      "Mertens' theorem: ∑_{n^ε < p ≤ n} 1/p ~ log(1/ε), so total coverage ~ n·log(1/ε)",
      "Erdős's lower bound: εₙ ≫ (log log log n)/(log log n)",
      "Covering is dual to sieving: cover vs. exclude one class per prime",
