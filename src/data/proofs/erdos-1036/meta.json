Must $G$ contain at least $2^{\\Omega_c(n)}$ many induced subgraphs which are not pairwise isomorphic?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and R\\'{e}nyi. Alon and Hajnal \\cite{AlHa91} proved that $G$ must contain at least\\[\\exp\\left(n(\\log n)^{-O(\\log\\log n)}\\right)\\]many non-isomorphic induced subgraphs.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Hajnal \\cite{ErHa89b} proved that if $G$ does not contain a complete bipartite graph or its complement on more than $c\\log n$ vertices then $G$ contains at least $2^{\\Omega_c(n)}$ many non-isomorphic induced subgraphs.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Shelah \\cite{Sh98}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AlHa91] Alon, N. and Hajnal, A., Ramsey graphs contain many distinct induced subgraphs.
