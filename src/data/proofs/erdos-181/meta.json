    "historicalContext": "Burr and Erdős conjectured in 1975 that the Ramsey number of the hypercube is linear in its vertex count. Tikhomirov (2022) obtained the best known bound R(Q_n) ≪ 2^{(2−c)n}, still exponential in n but subquadratic in 2^n.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove that R(Q_n) ≪ 2^n, where Q_n is the n-dimensional hypercube graph with 2^n vertices.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the hypercube graph, define the Ramsey number, and state the Burr–Erdős conjecture. Known bounds and the Erdős–Sós question are recorded.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Q_n has 2^n vertices and degree n; the conjecture asks for R(Q_n) = O(2^n)",
      "Tikhomirov (2022): R(Q_n) ≤ C · 2^{(2−c)n} for c ≈ 0.0366",
      "The bounded-degree Ramsey result (Lee 2017) doesn't apply since deg(Q_n) = n grows",
      "Lower bound R(Q_n) ≥ 2^n is trivial from vertex count",
      "Erdős and Sós couldn't determine if R(Q_n)/2^n → ∞"
