    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #237: Prime Plus Set Representations**\n\nThis problem concerns the representation of integers as the sum of a prime and an element from a dense set.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős (1950): Proved the result for A = {2^k : k ≥ 0}, the powers of two\n- The question remained open for general sets with logarithmic density\n- Chen and Ding (2022): Proved an even stronger result - any infinite set A suffices!\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nFor A ⊆ ℕ, define f(n) = |{(p,a) : p prime, a ∈ A, p + a = n}|. The question asks whether dense sets force f(n) to be unbounded.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ be a set such that $|A \\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}| \\gg \\log N$ for all large $N$.\n\nLet $f(n)$ count the number of solutions to $n = p + a$ for $p$ prime and $a \\in A$.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} f(n) = \\infty$?\n\n**Answer: YES** (Chen and Ding, 2022)\n\n**Stronger Result:** The logarithmic density condition can be replaced with just requiring $A$ to be infinite!",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Representation Count:** Define f(n) counting pairs (p,a) with p prime, a ∈ A, p + a = n.\n\n2. **Density Conditions:** Formalize logarithmic density and the infinite set condition.\n\n3. **Original Conjecture:** State that log-density implies unbounded limsup.\n\n4. **Stronger Version:** State that infinite sets suffice (Chen-Ding 2022).\n\n5. **Derive Original:** Show log-density implies infinite, so original follows from stronger.\n\n6. **Examples:** Powers of two, squares, prime powers as concrete instances.",
