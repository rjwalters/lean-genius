    "historicalContext": "**The Erdős-Rogers Problem**\n\nThis problem, first posed by Erdős and Rogers in 1962, asks a fundamental question at the intersection of Ramsey theory and extremal graph theory: in graphs that avoid K₄, how does avoiding triangles in induced subgraphs trade off against size?\n\n**Historical Progress on Upper Bounds**:\n- **1991**: Bollobás-Hind proved f(n) ≪ n^{7/10+o(1)}\n- **1994**: Krivelevich improved to n^{2/3}(log n)^{1/3}\n- **2013**: Wolfovitz achieved n^{1/2}(log n)^{120}\n- **2024**: Mubayi-Verstraete reached n^{1/2} log n (current best)\n\n**Lower Bounds**: The lower bound √n·√(log n)/log log n comes from Ramsey-theoretic arguments (Shearer's method).\n\n**The Gap**: The remaining gap of roughly (log n)^{1/2}·log log n between bounds is a major open problem.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet f(n) be the minimum, over all K₄-free graphs G on n vertices, of the maximum size of a triangle-free induced subgraph of G.\n\n**Equivalently**: What is the largest k such that EVERY K₄-free graph on n vertices contains a triangle-free induced subgraph on at least k vertices?\n\n**Current Bounds**:\n- Lower: f(n) ≫ √n · √(log n) / log log n\n- Upper: f(n) ≪ √n · log n\n\n**Status**: OPEN - the exact growth rate is unknown.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach to Bounds**\n\n**Upper Bounds (Construction)**:\n- Build K₄-free graphs where every large induced subgraph contains a triangle\n- Uses probabilistic methods and explicit algebraic constructions\n- The Mubayi-Verstraete construction uses careful graph blowups\n\n**Lower Bounds (Ramsey)**:\n- Every K₄-free graph has an independent set of size Ω(√n)\n- Independent sets are triangle-free, giving trivial √n bound\n- Shearer's method improves this using dependent random choice\n\n**Key Technique**: The problem connects to R(3,k) ≈ k²/log k (Ramsey numbers for triangles vs independent sets).",

      "Triangle-free graphs are automatically K₄-free, so the problem has content",
      "The trivial lower bound √n comes from independent sets in K₄-free graphs",
