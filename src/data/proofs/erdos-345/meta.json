  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980) studied the completeness threshold T(A) — the least m such that all n ≥ m are subset sums of A. For power sequences {n^k}, the thresholds grow rapidly. Erdős asked whether T(n^k) can ever decrease as k increases.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many k such that T(n^k) > T(n^{k+1})?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines subset sums, completeness, and the threshold T(A) axiomatically. Power sequences are defined and their completeness follows from Waring's problem. Known threshold values are axiomatised.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "T(n)=1, T(n²)=128, T(n³)=12758, T(n⁴)=5134240, T(n⁵)=67898771",
      "Known thresholds are rapidly increasing, but the question is about eventual decrease",
      "Erdős–Graham suggest k = 2^t for large t as candidates",
      "Completeness of power sequences follows from Waring's problem"
