  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Graham [ErGr75, p.526]. The conjecture asks whether the 'most complete' graph with m edges maximizes the Ramsey number. Surprisingly, the conjecture fails for small values of m (specifically m ∈ {2,3,4,5,7,8,9}), but the asymptotic version remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph with m edges and no isolated vertices. If m = C(n,2) + t with 0 ≤ t < n, is R(G) ≤ R(H) where H is K_n plus a new vertex connected to t vertices of K_n?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize edge colorings, Ramsey numbers for complete graphs and general graphs, define the 'maximally complete' graph construction, and state both the original conjecture and its asymptotic variant. The known counterexamples are recorded as an axiom.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The conjecture fails for m ∈ {2,3,4,5,7,8,9} - small counterexamples exist",
      "The asymptotic version (for large m) remains open",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #545 on whether the 'most complete' graph maximizes Ramsey number for a given edge count. The surprising discovery of small counterexamples (m ∈ {2,3,4,5,7,8,9}) shows the conjecture is false in general, but the asymptotic version remains open.",
    "implications": "Understanding which graphs maximize Ramsey number would shed light on the structure of extremal Ramsey graphs. Sudakov's 2^{O(√m)} bound provides a universal upper bound but doesn't identify the maximum.",
