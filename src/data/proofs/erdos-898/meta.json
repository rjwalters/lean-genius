  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Erdős-Mordell inequality is one of the most elegant results in plane geometry. Erdős proposed the problem in 1935 in the American Mathematical Monthly. Louis Mordell and David Barrow independently proved it in 1937. Since then, many alternative proofs have been discovered, including those by Kazarinoff (1957) and Bankoff (1958).",
    "problemStatement": "If P is an interior point of triangle ABC, and X, Y, Z are the feet of the perpendiculars from P to sides BC, CA, AB respectively, then:\n\nPA + PB + PC ≥ 2(PX + PY + PZ)\n\nIn other words, the sum of distances from P to the vertices is at least twice the sum of distances from P to the sides.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines points in the Euclidean plane ℝ²\n2. Defines perpendicular feet and distances to lines\n3. States the main inequality as ErdosMordellInequality\n4. Axiomatizes the theorem (multiple proof approaches noted)\n5. States the equality condition (equilateral + center)\n6. Explores generalizations to polygons and higher dimensions",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The constant 2 in the inequality is optimal",
      "Equality holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral and P is its center (which equals centroid, incenter, and circumcenter for equilateral triangles)",
      "The inequality extends to regular n-gons and to simplices in higher dimensions",
      "Multiple elegant proofs exist: trigonometric, law of cosines, elementary geometry"
