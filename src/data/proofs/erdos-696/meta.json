Let $H(n)$ be the largest $u$ such that there is a sequence of integers $d_1<\\cdots < d_u$ all dividing $n$ with $d_{i+1}\\equiv 1\\pmod{d_i}$.\n\nEstimate $h(n)$ and $H(n)$. Is it true that $H(n)/h(n)\\to \\infty$ for almost all $n$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s writes it is 'easy to see' that $h(n)\\to \\infty$ for almost all $n$ (which is proved in the comments by van Doorn), and believed he could show that the normal order of $h(n)$ is $\\log_*(n)$ (the iterated logarithm).\n\nSee also [695].\n\n\nBack to the problem",
