    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked in 1991 whether dense subgraphs of the n-dimensional hypercube Qₙ must contain 6-cycles (C₆). The hypercube Qₙ has 2ⁿ vertices and n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges, with vertices adjacent iff they differ in one coordinate.\n\n**Resolution:**\n- **1992 (Chung)**: Showed Qₙ can be edge-partitioned into 4 C₆-free subgraphs\n- **1993 (Brouwer-Dejter-Thomassen)**: Independent 4-coloring result\n- **1993 (Conder)**: Improved to 3 colors\n\nThe answer is NO: a subgraph with 1/4 (or even 1/3) of all edges need not contain C₆.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question:** Let Qₙ be the n-dimensional hypercube (2ⁿ vertices, n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges). For every ε > 0, if n is sufficiently large, does every subgraph of Qₙ with ≥ ε·n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges contain C₆?\n\n**Answer:** NO\n\n**Counterexamples:**\n- ε = 1/4: Chung's 4-partition (1992)\n- ε = 1/3: Conder's 3-coloring (1993)\n\n**Generalized Question (OPEN):** For C_{2k}, there may exist c > 0 and aₖ < 1 such that ≥ c·n^{aₖ}·2ⁿ edges forces C_{2k}.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the hypercube graph Qₙ via XOR of bit representations (vertices differ in exactly one coordinate). Cycles C_k are defined as injective sequences with cyclic adjacency. Chung's 1992 result is axiomatized: Qₙ can be partitioned into 4 C₆-free subgraphs. The main theorem shows Erdős's conjecture is false.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #666 asked whether ε-dense hypercube subgraphs must contain C₆. The answer is NO: Chung (1992) and Brouwer-Dejter-Thomassen (1993) independently showed Qₙ can be 4-partitioned into C₆-free subgraphs. Conder (1993) improved this to 3 colors.",
    "implications": "The result shows the hypercube has surprising structure allowing sparse cycle-free subgraphs. This connects to Ramsey-Turán problems in hypercubes and extremal graph theory in structured graphs.",
