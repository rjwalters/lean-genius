Is it true that, for every $\\epsilon>0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, every subgraph of $Q_n$ with\\[\\geq \\epsilon n2^{n-1}\\]many edges contains a $C_6$?\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er91} Erd\\H{o}s further suggests that perhaps, for every $k\\geq 3$, there are constants $c$ and $a_k<1$ such that every subgraph with at least $cn^{a_k}2^n$ many edges contains a $C_{2k}$, where $a_k\\to 0$ as $k\\to \\infty$.\n\nThe answer to this problem is no: Chung \\cite{Ch92} and Brouwer, Dejter, and Thomassen \\cite{BDT93} constructed an edge-partition of $Q_n$ into four subgraphs, each containing no $C_6$.\n\nSee also [86].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BDT93] Brouwer, A.
