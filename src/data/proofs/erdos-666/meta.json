    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #666**\n\nErdős posed this problem in 1991, asking whether dense subgraphs of the n-dimensional hypercube must contain 6-cycles. The hypercube Qₙ has 2ⁿ vertices (binary strings of length n) and n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges (vertices adjacent iff they differ in exactly one coordinate).\n\n**Resolution (1992-1993):**\nThe answer is NO, disproved independently by two groups:\n- **Chung (1992):** Constructed an explicit 4-partition of Qₙ's edges into C₆-free subgraphs\n- **Brouwer-Dejter-Thomassen (1993):** Independent 4-coloring construction avoiding C₄ and C₆\n\n**Further Improvement:**\nConder (1993) showed that only 3 colors suffice - the edges of Qₙ can be 3-colored with no monochromatic C₄ or C₆. This means subgraphs with 1/3 of all edges need not contain C₆.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet Qₙ be the n-dimensional hypercube (2ⁿ vertices, n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges).\n\n**Conjecture:** For every ε > 0, if n is sufficiently large, every subgraph of Qₙ with ≥ ε·n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges contains C₆.\n\n**Answer:** NO\n\n**Counterexamples:**\n- ε = 1/4: Chung's 4-partition (1992)\n- ε = 1/3: Conder's 3-coloring (1993)\n\n**Generalized Conjecture (OPEN):** For C_{2k}, ∃ c > 0 and aₖ < 1 such that ≥ c·n^{aₖ}·2ⁿ edges forces C_{2k}, with aₖ → 0 as k → ∞.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Hypercube Definition:** Qₙ defined via XOR popcount - vertices in Fin(2ⁿ) are adjacent iff their XOR has exactly one 1-bit (Hamming distance 1)\n\n2. **Cycle Definitions:**\n   - HasCycle G k: injective k-sequence with cyclic adjacency\n   - HasC4, HasC6, HasC2k: specific even cycle predicates\n\n3. **Density:**\n   - EpsilonDenseSubgraph: at least ε·n·2ⁿ⁻¹ edges\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - ErdosConjecture: the (false) original conjecture\n   - erdos_conjecture_false: theorem showing it's false\n   - chung_1992 axiom: 4-partition exists\n   - conder_1993 axiom: 3-coloring exists\n\n5. **Why Axioms:** The partition constructions are combinatorial and not in Mathlib",
