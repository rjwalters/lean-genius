    "title": "Lower Bound via lcm",
    "content": "δ(N) ≥ 1/lcm(1,...,N) = e^{-(1+o(1))N}. Any nonzero deviation |1 - Σ 1/n| is at least 1/lcm(1,...,N) since clearing denominators gives an integer. The PNT shows lcm(1,...,N) = e^{(1+o(1))N}.",

    "significance": "This is a precise asymptotic prediction placing the decay rate of δ(N) strictly between the lcm lower bound (rate 1) and no decay (rate 0)."
