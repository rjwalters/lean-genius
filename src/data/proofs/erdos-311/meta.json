  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980) studied the approximation of 1 by sums of distinct unit fractions from {1/1, 1/2, ..., 1/N}. The function δ(N) measures how close one can get to 1 without hitting it exactly. This connects to Egyptian fraction representations and the structure of the lcm of {1,...,N}.",
    "problemStatement": "Is δ(N) = e^{-(c+o(1))N} for some constant c ∈ (0,1)? That is, does the minimal nonzero deviation from 1 by unit fraction sums decay exponentially at a rate strictly between 0 and 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize δ(N) and state its positivity, the lower bound from lcm, Tang's upper bound, and the full conjecture in ε-N₀ form.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The trivial lower bound δ(N) ≥ 1/lcm(1,...,N) = e^{-(1+o(1))N} comes from clearing denominators",
      "Tang's upper bound exp(-cN/(log N log log N)³) is subexponential but far from e^{-cN}",
      "The conjectured rate c ∈ (0,1) would place δ(N) strictly between the lcm lower bound and any polynomial decay",
      "Kovac showed the variant asking about subsets summing exactly to 1 is equivalent",
      "The problem connects Egyptian fractions to the prime number theorem via lcm(1,...,N) estimates"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #311 asks whether the minimal nonzero deviation of unit fraction sums from 1 decays as e^{-cN} for some c ∈ (0,1). The trivial lcm lower bound gives rate 1, and Tang's upper bound is subexponential, leaving a large gap.",
