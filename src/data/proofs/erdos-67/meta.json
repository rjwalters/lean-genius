This is true, and was proved by Tao \\cite{Ta16}, who also proved the more general case when $f$ takes values on the unit sphere.\n\nIn several places (e.g. \\cite{Er64b}, \\cite{Er65b}, and \\cite{Er81}) Erd\\H{o}s further conjectured that\\[\\max_{md\\leq x}\\left\\lvert \\sum_{1\\leq k\\leq m}f(kd)\\right\\rvert \\gg \\log x.\\]In \\cite{Er85c} Erd\\H{o}s also asks about the special case when $f$ is multiplicative.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er64b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Problems and results on diophantine approximations.
