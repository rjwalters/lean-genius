Suppose $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ is such that there are no $k+1$ elements of $A$ which are relatively prime. An example is the set of all multiples of the first $k$ primes. Is this the largest such set?\n\n\n\nThis was disproved for $k=212$ by Ahlswede and Khachatrian \\cite{AhKh94}, who suggest that their methods can disprove this for arbitrarily large $k$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s later asked (\\cite{Er92b} and \\cite{Er95}) if the conjecture remains true provided $N\\geq (1+o(1))p_k^2$ (or, in a weaker form, whether it is true for $N$ sufficiently large depending on $k$).\n\nAhlswede and Khachatrian \\cite{AhKh95} proved this latter claim: in other words, for any fixed $k$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ then the largest such set is the set of all multiples of the first $k$ primes.\n\nSee also [534].\n\nThis is discussed in problem B26 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AhKh94] Ahlswede, Rudolf and Khachatrian, Levon H., On extremal sets without coprimes.
