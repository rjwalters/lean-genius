    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Simonovits (1984) conjectured that the Turán number for bipartite r-degenerate graphs H satisfies ex(n;H) ≪ n^{2-1/r}. A graph is r-degenerate if every induced subgraph has minimum degree ≤ r. This conjecture predicts that degeneracy alone determines the extremal exponent. Despite decades of work, the conjecture remains OPEN even for r=2. Erdős offered $500 for its resolution.",

    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines r-degeneracy, Turán numbers, and asymptotic bounds. The Erdős-Simonovits conjecture is stated precisely. The AKS partial result is axiomatized, along with the special case where max degree constraint holds. Key examples (complete bipartite graphs, cycles) are included, and the gap between known and conjectured bounds is verified.",
