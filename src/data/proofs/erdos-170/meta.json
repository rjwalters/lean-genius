Find the value of\\[\\lim_{N\\to \\infty}\\frac{F(N)}{N^{1/2}}.\\]\n\n\n\nThe Sparse Ruler problem. R\\'{e}dei asked whether this limit exists, which was proved by Erd\\H{o}s and G\\'{a}l \\cite{ErGa48}. Bounds on the limit were improved by Leech \\cite{Le56}. The limit is known to be in the interval $[1.56,\\sqrt{3}]$. The lower bound is due to Leech \\cite{Le56}, the upper bound is due to Wichmann \\cite{Wi63}. Computational evidence by Pegg \\cite{Pe20} suggests that the upper bound is the truth. A similar question can be asked without the restriction $A\\subset \\{0,1,\\ldots,N\\}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGa48] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and G\\'{a}l, I., On the representation of $1,2,\\ldots,N$ by differences.
