  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The AM-GM inequality has ancient origins, with geometric proofs dating to Euclid. The general n-variable form was developed in the 19th century by Cauchy. It is fundamental to optimization, economics, and information theory.\n\nThe inequality follows from the simple observation that squares are non-negative: (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))^2 >= 0 expands to show that (a + b)/2 >= sqrt(ab).",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Wiedijk #38)**: For non-negative real numbers a and b:\n\n$$(a + b) / 2 \\geq \\sqrt{ab}$$\n\n**General Form**: For n non-negative real numbers:\n\n$$\\frac{a_1 + \\cdots + a_n}{n} \\geq \\sqrt[n]{a_1 \\cdots a_n}$$\n\n**Equality Condition**: Equality holds if and only if all numbers are equal.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Elementary Proof (Two Variables):**\n\nThe key insight is that any square is non-negative:\n1. (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))^2 >= 0\n2. Expanding: a - 2*sqrt(ab) + b >= 0\n3. Rearranging: a + b >= 2*sqrt(ab)\n4. Dividing by 2: (a + b)/2 >= sqrt(ab)\n\n**Mathlib Approach:**\nThe formalization uses `Real.geom_mean_le_arith_mean_weighted` for the general weighted form, which reduces to the classical AM-GM when all weights are equal.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The inequality follows from the non-negativity of squares",
      "Equality holds if and only if all numbers are equal",
      "The weighted form generalizes to arbitrary positive weights summing to 1",
      "The product of n numbers is maximized when their sum is fixed and they are all equal"
