  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem explores the behavior of additive arithmetic functions—functions satisfying f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) whenever gcd(a,b) = 1. Classic examples include ω(n) (distinct prime factors), Ω(n) (total prime factors with multiplicity), and log(n).\n\nErdős asked: if an additive function f grows unboundedly fast on prime powers (specifically, if limsup f(p^k)/log(p^k) = ∞), does this force the consecutive differences f(n+1) - f(n) to also be unbounded when normalized by log(n)?\n\nThe converse direction was settled by Wirsing in 1970, who proved that if consecutive differences are BOUNDED (|f(n+1) - f(n)| ≤ C), then f must behave like c·log(n) + O(1). This characterizes the logarithm as essentially the unique additive function with bounded consecutive differences.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n)$ be an additive function (so that $f(ab) = f(a) + f(b)$ when $(a,b) = 1$) such that\n$$\\limsup_{p,k} \\frac{f(p^k)}{\\log(p^k)} = \\infty$$\n\n**Part I**: Is it true that $\\displaystyle\\limsup_n \\frac{f(n+1) - f(n)}{\\log n} = \\infty$?\n\n**Part II**: Is it true that $\\displaystyle\\limsup_n \\frac{f(n+1)}{f(n)} = \\infty$?\n\n**Status**: Both parts remain **OPEN**.\n\n**Known** (Wirsing 1970): If $|f(n+1) - f(n)| \\leq C$, then $f(n) = c\\log n + O(1)$.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Defining additive functions**: IsAdditive f means f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1\n\n2. **Defining unbounded growth**: UnboundedOnPrimePowers captures the limsup condition on prime powers\n\n3. **Stating both conjectures as axioms**: Parts I and II about consecutive differences\n\n4. **Stating Wirsing's theorem**: The solved converse direction\n\n5. **Defining restricted variants**: StronglyAdditive (f(p^k) = f(p)) and CompletelyAdditive (f(p^k) = k·f(p))\n\n6. **Providing examples**: omega, bigOmega, and log as concrete additive functions",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Additive vs multiplicative**: Additive functions add on coprime products; multiplicative functions multiply. The logarithm is additive: log(ab) = log(a) + log(b).",
      "**Why prime powers matter**: For additive f, the value f(n) is determined by f on prime powers. If f grows fast on prime powers, it should affect consecutive values.",
      "**Wirsing's characterization**: The logarithm is essentially unique among additive functions with bounded consecutive differences. This is a beautiful rigidity result.",
      "**Strongly vs completely additive**: ω(n) counts distinct primes (strongly additive: ω(p^k) = 1), while Ω(n) counts with multiplicity (completely additive: Ω(p^k) = k).",
      "**Open status**: Despite progress on the converse, Erdős's original questions about the forward direction remain unresolved."
