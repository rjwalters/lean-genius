    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #671**\n\nThis is a deep problem in approximation theory about the relationship between the Lebesgue function and Lagrange interpolation convergence.\n\n**Key History:**\n- 1931: Bernstein proves lambda_n(x) diverges at some point for any interpolation scheme\n- 1980: Erdos and Vertesi prove that for any points, some continuous f has |L^n f(x)| -> infinity a.e.\n- Present: Questions 1 and 2 remain open with $250 prize\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nThe Lebesgue function lambda_n(x) = sum |p_i^n(x)| controls interpolation error: the error is bounded by (1 + Lambda_n) times the best polynomial approximation. When Lambda_n grows, uniform convergence fails. The questions ask whether *pointwise* convergence can still occur when lambda_n diverges.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nGiven points $a_i^n \\in [-1,1]$, define Lagrange basis polynomials $p_i^n$ and interpolation $L^n f(x) = \\sum f(a_i^n) p_i^n(x)$. The Lebesgue function is $\\lambda_n(x) = \\sum |p_i^n(x)|$.\n\n**Question 1:** Does there exist points such that for every continuous $f$, there exists $x$ with $\\limsup \\lambda_n(x) = \\infty$ yet $L^n f(x) \\to f(x)$?\n\n**Question 2:** Can $\\lambda_n(x) \\to \\infty$ for ALL $x$, yet for every continuous $f$, some $x$ has $L^n f(x) \\to f(x)$?\n\n**Prize: $250**",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Structures:** Define InterpolationPoints, PointSequence for varying n.\n\n2. **Lagrange Basis:** Define p_i^n and prove interpolation properties.\n\n3. **Lebesgue Function:** Define lambda_n(x) and the Lebesgue constant Lambda_n.\n\n4. **Classical Theorems:** State Bernstein (1931) and Erdos-Vertesi (1980) as sorried theorems.\n\n5. **The Questions:** Define Question1 and Question2 formally as Prop.\n\n6. **Special Cases:** Chebyshev nodes (optimal) and equidistant nodes (bad).\n\n7. **Main Conjecture:** The relationship between Q1 and Q2.\n\nThe questions are axiomatized since they remain open.",

      "**Erdos-Vertesi:** Even stronger - for any nodes, some continuous f diverges almost everywhere under L^n",
      "**Chebyshev Nodes:** x_k = cos((2k-1)pi/2n) minimize Lambda_n to O(log n) - the best possible",
