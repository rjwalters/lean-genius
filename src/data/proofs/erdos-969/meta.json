  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the distribution of squarefree integers, which are integers not divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. The density of squarefree integers converges to 6/π² ≈ 0.6079, a beautiful fact connected to the Basel problem and ζ(2) = π²/6. The question of how the actual count Q(x) deviates from this asymptotic is intimately tied to some of the deepest problems in analytic number theory, including the Riemann Hypothesis. The problem has attracted work from Evelyn-Linfoot (1931), Walfisz (1963), and Liu (2016), but remains fundamentally open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let Q(x) count the number of squarefree integers in [1, x]. Determine the order of magnitude of the error term E(x) in the asymptotic: Q(x) = (6/π²)x + E(x). Known bounds: x^(1/4) ≪ |E(x)| ≪ x^(1/2 - o(1)). Conjectured: E(x) ≍ x^(1/4).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines squarefree integers using Mathlib's Squarefree predicate, then constructs the counting function Q(x) and error term E(x). Key bounds are axiomatized: the elementary upper bound E(x) ≪ x^(1/2), Walfisz's improvement to x^(1/2 - o(1)}, and Evelyn-Linfoot's lower bound E(x) ≫ x^(1/4). The connection to the Riemann Hypothesis is formalized: proving E(x) ≪ x^(1/4+ε) would imply RH. Liu's conditional bound under RH is also stated.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #969 asks for the true order of magnitude of E(x), the error term in the squarefree counting asymptotic.
