  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Rosen constructed this greedy sequence and studied it with Erdős in the 1970s. The construction mirrors the philosophy behind Sidon sets (B₂ sequences) but relaxes the uniqueness condition to a cumulative count condition. The sequence appears as OEIS A390642.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 0 = a₀ < a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ where a_{k+1} is the smallest n with repCount(n) < n. Is R(x) = x + O(x^{1/4+o(1)})?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the greedy construction, state both the weak conjecture R(x) = (1+o(1))x and the strong conjecture with x^{1/4} error, and connect to B₂ sequences and the Erdős–Turán conjecture.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The greedy rule ensures R(a_{k+1}) < a_{k+1} while R(m) ≥ m between consecutive elements",
      "The weak conjecture R(x) ≤ (1+o(1))x remains open",
      "The x^{1/4} error term parallels B₂ sequence theory where R(x) ~ √x",
      "The Rosen sequence is not B₂ — it allows repeated sums but controls their density",
      "The problem cannot be resolved by finite computation"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #954 asks about the representation count of Rosen's greedy additive sequence. Even the weak estimate R(x) = (1+o(1))x is unproven, let alone the conjectured x^{1/4+o(1)} error bound. The problem remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would illuminate the boundary between Sidon-type uniqueness and density-controlled additive constructions. The greedy approach suggests a natural tradeoff between sequence density and representation control.",
