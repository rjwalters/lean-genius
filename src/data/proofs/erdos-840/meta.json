Note that $2/\\sqrt{3}=1.15\\cdots$. The lower bound is taking a genuine Sidon set $B\\subset [1,N/3]$ of size $\\sim N^{1/2}/\\sqrt{3}$ and taking the union with $\\{N-b : b\\in B\\}$. The upper bound was improved by Pikhurko \\cite{Pi06} to\\[f(N) \\leq \\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{(\\pi+2)^2}\\right)^{-1/2}+o(1)\\right)N^{1/2}\\](the constant here is $=1.863\\cdots$).\n\nThe analogous question with $A-A$ in place of $A+A$ is simpler, and there the maximal size is $\\sim N^{1/2}$, as proved by Cilleruelo.\n\n\nSee also [30], [819], and [864].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81h] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some problems and results on additive and multiplicative\nnumber theory.
