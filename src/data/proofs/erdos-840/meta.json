  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #840 concerns quasi-Sidon sets, a relaxation of the classical Sidon sets (B₂ sequences). A Sidon set has all pairwise sums distinct, giving |A+A| = C(|A|,2) + |A| exactly. A quasi-Sidon set only requires |A+A| to approach C(|A|,2) asymptotically. The problem asks for the maximum size f(N) of a quasi-Sidon subset of {1,...,N}. Erdős and Freud studied this in 1991, establishing both upper and lower bounds of order √N. Pikhurko (2006) improved the upper bound constant.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(N) be the size of the largest quasi-Sidon subset A ⊆ {1, ..., N}, where A is quasi-Sidon if |A + A| = (1 + o(1)) · C(|A|, 2). How does f(N) grow?\n\nKnown bounds:\n- Lower: f(N) ≥ (2/√3 + o(1))√N ≈ 1.15√N (Erdős-Freud, 1991)\n- Upper: f(N) ≤ (c_P + o(1))√N where c_P ≈ 1.86 (Pikhurko, 2006)\n\nThe question is to determine the exact asymptotic constant.",
    "proofStrategy": "This problem remains OPEN. Our formalization defines Sidon sets (all pairwise sums distinct), quasi-Sidon sets (sumset size approaches expected), and the function f(N). We axiomatize the Erdős-Freud bounds and Pikhurko's improvement. The lower bound construction uses a Sidon set B ⊆ [1, N/3] combined with its reflection {N - b : b ∈ B}.",

      "Lower bound construction: Sidon set B in [1, N/3] union {N - b : b ∈ B} achieves ~(2/√3)√N",
      "Pikhurko's upper bound uses edge-magic graphs and thin additive bases",
