They also proved that\\[\\frac{1}{4}\\leq \\lim_r \\frac{h(r)}{r^2}\\leq \\frac{5}{4}.\\]The best bounds known for the limit are\\[\\frac{1}{3}\\leq \\lim_r \\frac{h(r)}{r^2}\\leq \\frac{1}{2},\\]the lower bound originally due to Grekos \\cite{Gr88} and the upper bound to Nash \\cite{Na93}. Improved bounds in the lower order terms were given by Plagne \\cite{Pl04}.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{ErGr80b} showed $h(2)=4$. Nash \\cite{Na93} showed $h(3)=7$. The value of $h(4)$ is unknown, but it is known \\cite{Pl04} that $10\\leq h(4)\\leq 11$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80b] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R. L., On bases with an exact order.
