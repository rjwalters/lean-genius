  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem around 1992, building on the classical Erdős–Turán (1941) study of Sidon sets. The function F(N) measures the largest B₂ subset of {1,...,N}. While F(N) ~ √N is well-established, the fine structure of its growth — whether F can jump by more than 1 over intervals of fixed length — remains unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that for every k ≥ 1, F(N+k) ≤ F(N) + 1 for all sufficiently large N, where F(N) is the maximum Sidon subset size of {1,...,N}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize Sidon sets, define F(N) axiomatically, state the Erdős–Turán asymptotic bounds, and present both the basic conjecture (fixed k) and the stronger form (k ≈ ε√N). We also state consequences about the sparsity of increase points.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A Sidon (B₂) set has all pairwise sums distinct: |S| ≤ √N + O(N^{1/4})",
      "F(N) ~ √N, so F increases by 1 about √N times in {1,...,N}",
      "The conjecture says F plateaus on every fixed-length interval for large N",
      "The stronger form suggests plateaus of length ~ε√N between increases",
      "Known values: F(1)=1, F(2)=2, F(3)=3, F(6)=4, F(11)=5, F(18)=6"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #155 asks whether the maximum Sidon subset function F(N) grows so slowly that F(N+k) ≤ F(N)+1 for any fixed k and large N. This captures the intuition that F increases by 1 very rarely. The problem remains open, with a stronger variant suggesting plateaus of length ~ε√N.",
    "implications": "A positive answer would provide fine structural information about the distribution of Sidon sets, complementing the classical Erdős–Turán asymptotics. It would show that the 'next' larger Sidon set requires a substantial expansion of the interval.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does F(N+k) ≤ F(N)+1 hold for all fixed k and large N?",
      "Does the stronger form with k ≈ ε√N hold?",
      "What is the exact threshold: the largest k(N) such that F(N+k(N)) ≤ F(N)+1?",
      "Can the gap F(N) - √N be determined more precisely?"
