  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian posed this in 1958, asking about extremal lemniscates in complex analysis. The problem connects polynomial theory with geometric measure theory. Tao's 2025 breakthrough resolved the conjecture for all sufficiently large n.",
    "problemStatement": "Is the arc length of {z : |p(z)| = 1} maximized by p(z) = z^n - 1 among all monic degree-n polynomials?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize monic polynomials, lemniscate length, and the extremal polynomial z^n-1. We trace the improving upper bounds from 4πn to 2n + O(n^{7/8}) and state Tao's large-n global optimality result.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The lemniscate of z^n-1 has n-fold symmetry with length ~2n",
      "Upper bounds improved over 50 years: 4πn → 2πn → 2n + O(n^{7/8})",
      "Fryntov–Nazarov proved z^n-1 is a local maximum (2009)",
      "Tao (2025) proved z^n-1 is the unique global maximum for large n",
      "Only n=2 is fully resolved (Eremenko–Hayman 1999); small n remain open"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #114 is resolved for large n by Tao (2025) and for n=2 by Eremenko–Hayman (1999). The full conjecture for all n ≥ 1 remains open with a $250 bounty. The extremal polynomial z^n-1 is the conjectured maximizer.",
    "implications": "A full resolution would establish a sharp isoperimetric-type inequality for polynomial lemniscates, with applications to potential theory and approximation theory in the complex plane.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does Tao's proof extend to all n, or are small n genuinely different?",
      "What is the exact value of the maximum lemniscate length for small n?",
      "Are there near-maximizers besides z^n-1 for large n?"
