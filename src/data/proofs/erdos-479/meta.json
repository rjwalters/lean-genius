It is easy to see that $2^n\\not\\equiv 1\\mod{n}$ for all $n>1$, so the restriction $k\\neq 1$ is necessary. Erd\\H{o}s and Graham report that Graham, Lehmer, and Lehmer have proved this for $k=2^i$ for $i\\geq 1$, or if $k=-1$, but I cannot find such a paper. Tang has written a short note giving a proof for this case.\n\nAs an indication of the difficulty, when $k=3$ the smallest $n$ such that $2^n\\equiv 3\\pmod{n}$ is $n=4700063497$.\n\nThe minimal such $n$ for each $k$ is A036236 in the OEIS.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
