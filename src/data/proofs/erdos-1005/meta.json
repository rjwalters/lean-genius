    "historicalContext": "**Farey Sequences**\n\nThe Farey sequence F_n consists of all reduced fractions a/b with 0 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ n, arranged in increasing order. These sequences have remarkable properties: adjacent fractions a/b and c/d satisfy |ad - bc| = 1, and the mediant (a+c)/(b+d) appears in F_{b+d}.\n\n**The Mayer-Erdős Phenomenon**: In 1942, Mayer observed that consecutive Farey fractions tend to be 'similarly ordered' - meaning (a_k - a_l)(b_k - b_l) ≥ 0 for nearby fractions. Erdős (1943) proved this phenomenon persists for runs of length Ω(n).\n\n**Modern Progress**: van Doorn (2025) established the best known bounds, showing the maximum run length f(n) satisfies (1/12 - o(1))n ≤ f(n) ≤ n/4 + O(1), and conjectured the upper bound is tight.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet a₁/b₁, a₂/b₂, ... be the Farey fractions of order n ≥ 4 (in increasing order).\n\nTwo fractions aₖ/bₖ and aₗ/bₗ are **similarly ordered** if:\n$$(a_k - a_l)(b_k - b_l) \\geq 0$$\n\nLet **f(n)** = largest k such that some run of k consecutive Farey fractions are pairwise similarly ordered.\n\n**Question**: Estimate f(n). Is there a constant c > 0 such that:\n$$f(n) = (c + o(1))n$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Best Known**: (1/12 - o(1))n ≤ f(n) ≤ n/4 + O(1) (van Doorn 2025)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Understanding Similar Ordering**\n\n1. **Geometric View**: Similarly ordered means both numerator and denominator move in the same direction (both increase or both decrease).\n\n2. **Stern-Brocot Connection**: Farey fractions correspond to nodes in the Stern-Brocot tree. Similarly ordered runs correspond to monotone paths.\n\n3. **Counting Approach**: The Farey sequence has ~3n²/π² elements. Understanding run lengths requires analyzing local structure.\n\n**van Doorn's Methods**:\n- Upper bound: Analyze obstructions to similar ordering using mediant properties\n- Lower bound: Construct explicit long similarly ordered runs\n- Gap: Factor of 3 between bounds suggests complex transition behavior",
