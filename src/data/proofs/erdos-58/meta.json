  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Conjectured by Bollobás and Erdős, this problem quantifies the relationship between chromatic number and the diversity of odd cycle lengths. Bollobás and Shelah confirmed k=1. Gyárfás proved the full result in 1992, also showing that 2-connected graphs either contain K_{2k+2} or have a low-degree vertex. Gao-Huo-Ma (2021) strengthened this to show high chromatic number forces consecutive odd cycle lengths.",
    "problemStatement": "If G is a graph which contains odd cycles of ≤ k different lengths, then χ(G) ≤ 2k+2, with equality if and only if G contains K_{2k+2}.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines odd cycle lengths and chromatic number, then states Gyárfás' theorem as axioms. Special cases k=0 (bipartite) and k=1 (Bollobás-Shelah) are derived. The Gao-Huo-Ma strengthening about consecutive odd lengths is also formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "k=0: No odd cycles implies bipartite (χ ≤ 2)",
      "k=1: At most one odd cycle length implies χ ≤ 4 (Bollobás-Shelah)",
      "Equality χ = 2k+2 characterizes graphs containing K_{2k+2}",
      "2-connected case: either K_{2k+2} or low-degree vertex exists",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #58, solved by Gyárfás in 1992. The result establishes a tight relationship between chromatic number and the number of distinct odd cycle lengths: χ(G) ≤ 2k+2 with equality characterizing the presence of K_{2k+2}.",
    "implications": "This provides a powerful tool for bounding chromatic number by analyzing odd cycle structure. The Gao-Huo-Ma strengthening shows that high chromatic number forces very specific cycle structures.",
