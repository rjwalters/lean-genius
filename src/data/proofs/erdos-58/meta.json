Bollob\\'{a}s and Shelah have confirmed this for $k=1$. Proved by Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s \\cite{Gy92}, who proved the stronger result that, if $G$ is 2-connected, then $G$ is either $K_{2k+2}$ or contains a vertex of degree at most $2k$.\n\nA stronger form was established by Gao, Huo, and Ma \\cite{GaHuMa21}, who proved that if a graph $G$ has chromatic number $\\chi(G)\\geq 2k+3$ then $G$ contains cycles of $k+1$ consecutive odd lengths.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GaHuMa21] Gao, Jun and Huo, Qingyi and Ma, Jie, A strengthening on odd cycles in graphs of given chromatic number.
