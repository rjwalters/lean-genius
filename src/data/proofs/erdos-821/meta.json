Is it true that, for every $\\epsilon>0$, there exist infinitely many $n$ such that\\[g(n) > n^{1-\\epsilon}?\\]\n\n\n\nPillai proved that $\\limsup g(n)=\\infty$ and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er35b} proved that there exists some constant $c>0$ such that $g(n) >n^c$ for infinitely many $n$.\n\nThis conjecture would follow if we knew that, for every $\\epsilon>0$, there are $\\gg_\\epsilon \\frac{x}{\\log x}$ many primes $p<x$ such that all prime factors of $p-1$ are $<p^\\epsilon$.\n\nThe best known bound is that there are infinitely many $n$ such that\\[g(n) > n^{0.71568\\cdots},\\]obtained by Lichtman \\cite{Li22} as a consequence of proving that there are $\\geq \\frac{x}{(\\log x)^{O(1)}}$ many primes $p\\leq x$ such that all prime factors of $p-1$ are $\\leq x^{0.2843\\cdots}$ (which improves a number of previous exponents, most recently Baker and Harman \\cite{BaHa98}).\n\nThe average size of $g(n)$ was investigated by Luca and Pollack \\cite{LuPo11}.\n\nSee also [416].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaHa98] Baker, R.
