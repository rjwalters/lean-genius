  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1974 about the mutual coprimality properties of sequences k^n − 1. The problem connects Fermat's little theorem, which guarantees p | k^n − 1 when p − 1 | n, with the structure of shared prime factors among exponential expressions.",
    "problemStatement": "Let h(n) be the minimal k ≥ 2 such that 2^n−1, 3^n−1, ..., k^n−1 are pairwise coprime. Study the behavior of h(n): density of h(n) = p, whether lim inf h(n) = ∞, and the role of large prime divisors of n+1.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define h(n) and mutual coprimality, state the three main questions, and record known results including the prime characterization h(n) = n+1 ↔ n+1 prime.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "h(n) = n+1 if and only if n+1 is prime (Fermat's little theorem)",
      "h(n) is unbounded for odd n",
      "Conjectured that h(n) = 3 for infinitely many n",
      "When p − 1 | n, the prime p divides all k^n − 1, creating shared factors",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #770 studies the function h(n) capturing when the sequence 2^n−1, 3^n−1, ... first becomes mutually coprime. The interplay between prime factorization of n+1 and Fermat's theorem creates complex behavior that is not well understood.",
    "implications": "Understanding h(n) would illuminate the distribution of shared prime factors among exponential expressions, with connections to Mersenne numbers, cyclotomic polynomials, and the distribution of primes.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does the density of n with h(n) = p exist for all primes p?",
      "Does lim inf h(n) = ∞?",
      "Is h(n) determined by the largest prime p with p − 1 | n?",
