    "summary": "Erdős Problem #529 asks about the growth rate of self-avoiding walk end-to-end distance in various dimensions. For k ≥ 5, Hara and Slade proved d_k(n) ~ D√n. For k = 2, Duminil-Copin and Hammond proved d_2(n) = o(n). The conjectured behavior is d_2(n) ~ n^{3/4}, d_3(n) ~ n^{0.588}, and d_4(n) ~ (log n)^{1/8}√n. Question 2 is now believed FALSE for k = 3, 4.",
    "implications": "**Connections to Physics and Mathematics**\n\n1. **Polymer Physics:** SAW models linear polymers in good solvents\n\n2. **Critical Phenomena:** ν is a critical exponent analogous to magnetization\n\n3. **Conformal Field Theory:** 2D SAW connects to SLE (Schramm-Loewner Evolution)\n\n4. **Lace Expansion:** Technique developed by Brydges-Spencer used in proofs\n\n5. **Universality:** Critical exponents depend only on dimension, not lattice details",
