Is it true that\\[\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{d_2(n)}{n^{1/2}}= \\infty?\\]Is it true that\\[d_k(n)\\ll n^{1/2}\\]for $k\\geq 3$?\n\n\n\nSlade \\cite{Sl87} proved that, for $k$ sufficiently large, $d_k(n)\\sim Dn^{1/2}$ for some constant $D>0$ (independent of $k$). Hara and Slade (\\cite{HaSl91} and \\cite{HaSl92}) proved this for all $k\\geq 5$.\n\nFor $k=2$ Duminil-Copin and Hammond \\cite{DuHa13} have proved that $d_2(n)=o(n)$.\n\nIt is now conjectured that $d_k(n)\\ll n^{1/2}$ is false for $k=3$ and $k=4$, and more precisely (see for example Section 1.4 of \\cite{MaSl93}) that $d_2(n)\\sim Dn^{3/4}$, $d_3(n)\\sim n^{\\nu}$ where $\\nu\\approx 0.59$, and $d_4(n)\\sim D(\\log n)^{1/8}n^{1/2}$.\n\nMadras and Slade \\cite{MaSl93} have a monograph on the topic of self-avoiding walks.\n\nSee also [528].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DuHa13] Duminil-Copin, Hugo and Hammond, Alan, Self-avoiding walk is sub-ballistic.
