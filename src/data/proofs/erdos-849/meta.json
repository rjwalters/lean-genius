For $t=3$ one could take $a=120$, and for $t=4$ one could take $a=3003$. There are no known examples for $t\\geq 5$.\n\nBoth Erd\\H{o}s and Singmaster believed the answer to this question is no, and in fact that there exists an absolute upper bound on the number of solutions.\n\nMatomäki, Radziwill, Shao, Tao, and Teräväinen \\cite{MRSTT22} have proved that there are always at most two solutions if we restrict $k$ to\\[k\\geq \\exp((\\log n)^{2/3+\\epsilon}),\\]assuming $a$ is sufficiently large depending on $\\epsilon>0$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er96b] Erd\\\"{o}s, Paul, Some problems I presented or planned to present in my short\ntalk.
