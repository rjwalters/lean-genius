  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős and Gordon** posed this question 'many years ago' (before 1996), though it is now commonly known as **Singmaster's Conjecture** (1971).\n\n**The Question**: Does every multiplicity t ≥ 1 occur? That is, for each t, is there an integer a appearing exactly t times in Pascal's triangle (with 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2)?\n\n**Known Cases**:\n- t = 1: a = 2 (appears only as C(2,1))\n- t = 2: a = 6 (appears as C(4,2) and C(6,1))\n- t = 3: a = 120 (appears at C(10,3), C(16,2), C(120,1))\n- t = 4: a = 3003 (appears at C(14,6), C(15,5), C(78,2), C(3003,1))\n- t ≥ 5: **NO KNOWN EXAMPLES**\n\n**Modern Progress**: Matomäki, Radziwill, Shao, Tao, and Teräväinen (2022) proved that in the 'interior' of Pascal's triangle (k large), there are at most 2 solutions for sufficiently large a.",
    "problemStatement": "Define the **multiplicity** of a value a in Pascal's triangle as the number of distinct n such that C(n,k) = a for some 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2.\n\n**Erdős Problem #849 (OPEN)**: For every t ≥ 1, does there exist a value a with multiplicity exactly t?\n\n**Singmaster's Conjecture**: There exists an absolute constant N such that no value appears more than N times. The conjectured bound is N = 8.\n\n**Computational Evidence**: OEIS A003015 lists numbers appearing 5 or more times. Currently only 1 is known (and 1 doesn't count with our k ≥ 1 restriction).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Core definitions**: BinomMultiplicitySet captures pairs (n,k) with C(n,k) = a and 1 ≤ k ≤ n/2\n\n2. **Multiplicity functions**: binomMultiplicity (counting pairs) and binomNMultiplicity (counting distinct n)\n\n3. **Basic properties**: Every a ≥ 2 appears at least once as C(a,1) = a\n\n4. **Verified examples**: Using native_decide to verify C(10,3)=120, C(14,6)=3003, etc.\n\n5. **Singmaster's Conjecture**: Axiomatized as multiplicity_bound_8\n\n6. **Main conjecture**: erdos_849_conjecture states existence of a for each t",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Edge vs Interior**: C(a,1) = a provides one appearance on the 'edge'. Triangular numbers give C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. The hard part is counting 'deep' appearances.",
      "**Why t=5 is hard**: Values with high multiplicity require multiple coincidences: edge appearance, triangular appearance, AND one or more deep appearances.",
      "**Singmaster bound**: The conjectured bound of 8 comes from 3003, which appears 4 times, and the pattern suggests 8 should suffice.",
      "**MRSTT 2022 breakthrough**: For 'interior' entries (k ≥ exp((log n)^{2/3+ε})), multiplicities are at most 2 for large a.",
      "**Both directions open**: We don't know if multiplicity 5 exists, NOR if there's an absolute bound on multiplicities."

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #849, which asks whether every positive integer t occurs as the exact multiplicity of some value in Pascal's triangle. The problem is closely related to Singmaster's Conjecture about bounding multiplicities. While t = 1, 2, 3, 4 are achieved (by 2, 6, 120, 3003 respectively), no value with multiplicity exactly 5 is known.",
    "implications": "This problem connects combinatorics (Pascal's triangle structure) to number theory (which values can coincidentally equal multiple binomial coefficients). Understanding multiplicities has implications for algorithms that search Pascal's triangle and for understanding the distribution of binomial coefficients.",

      "Does there exist a value with multiplicity exactly 5?",
      "Is there an absolute bound N such that all multiplicities are ≤ N?",
