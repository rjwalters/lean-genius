For any $n\\geq 1$ let\\[R_n(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{1}{m_i}<x\\]be the maximal sum of $n$ distinct unit fractions which is $<x$.\n\nIs it true that, for almost all $x$, for sufficiently large $n$, we have\\[R_{n+1}(x)=R_n(x)+\\frac{1}{m},\\]where $m$ is minimal such that $m$ does not appear in $R_n(x)$ and the right-hand side is $<x$? (That is, are the best underapproximations eventually always constructed in a 'greedy' fashion?)\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham write it is 'not difficult' to construct irrational $x$ such that this fails (although give no proof or reference, and it seems to still be an open problem to actually construct some such irrational $x$). Curtiss \\cite{Cu22} showed that this is true for $x=1$ and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er50b} showed it is true for all $x=1/m$ with $m\\geq 1$. Nathanson \\cite{Na23} has shown it is true for $x=a/b$ when $a\\mid b+1$ and Chu \\cite{Ch23b} has shown it is true for a larger class of rationals; it is still unknown whether this is true for all rational $x>0$.\n\nWithout the 'eventually' condition this can fail for some rational $x$ (although Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er50b} showed it holds without the eventually for rationals of the form $1/m$). For example\\[R_1(\\tfrac{11}{24})=\\frac{1}{3}\\]but\\[R_2(\\tfrac{11}{24})=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{5}.\\]Kova\\v{c} \\cite{Ko24b} has proved that this is false - in fact as false as possible: the set of $x\\in (0,\\infty)$ for which the best underapproximations are eventually 'greedy' has Lebesgue measure zero. (It remains an open problem to give any explicit example of a number which is not eventually greedy, despite the fact that almost all numbers have this property.)\n\nSee also [282].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ch23b] H.
