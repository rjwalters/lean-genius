  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns Egyptian fractions - sums of distinct unit fractions like 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7. For a real x > 0, let R_n(x) be the best underapproximation using n distinct unit fractions. The 'greedy' algorithm adds the largest possible unit fraction at each step.\n\nErdős asked: for almost all x, do the best underapproximations eventually become greedy? Curtiss (1922) and Erdős (1950) showed specific cases where this holds. Nathanson (2023) and Chu (2023) extended to classes of rationals.\n\nKovač (2024) provided the definitive answer: NO. The set of eventually greedy numbers has Lebesgue measure ZERO - almost all numbers are NOT eventually greedy. Remarkably, no explicit non-greedy example has been constructed.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet $R_n(x)$ be the maximum sum of $n$ distinct unit fractions less than $x$.\n\n**Question:** For almost all $x > 0$, is it true that for sufficiently large $n$:\n$$R_{n+1}(x) = R_n(x) + \\frac{1}{m}$$\nwhere $m$ is the greedy choice (smallest valid denominator)?\n\n**Answer:** NO (Kovač 2024)\n\nThe set of $x$ with this property has Lebesgue measure zero.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Egyptian fractions as sums over finite sets of denominators. The best underapproximation R_n(x) is axiomatized. The eventually greedy property captures when greedy choices eventually dominate. Kovač's theorem is the main result: measure(EventuallyGreedySet) = 0. Positive results for specific classes (Curtiss, Erdős, Nathanson, Chu) are also included.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #206 is SOLVED (Disproved). Kovač (2024) proved that the set of x for which best underapproximations are eventually greedy has Lebesgue measure zero. This is 'as false as possible' - almost all numbers are NOT eventually greedy.",
    "implications": "This result reveals a striking dichotomy: specific structured numbers (rationals of certain forms) are eventually greedy, but the generic case is not. The measure-zero nature means greedy behavior is exceptional, not typical. The open problem of constructing an explicit non-greedy number highlights the gap between existence and construction in mathematics.",
