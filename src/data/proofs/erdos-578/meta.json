  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Bollobás conjectured that random graphs G(2^d, 1/2) almost surely contain the d-dimensional hypercube Q_d. This was part of a broader program studying what subgraphs appear in random graphs. Riordan (2000) solved this affirmatively, showing even p > 1/4 suffices, and proved the number of copies is normally distributed.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED: YES)**\n\nThe d-dimensional hypercube Q_d has 2^d vertices and d·2^{d-1} edges.\n\n**Question:** If G is a random graph on 2^d vertices with edge probability p = 1/2, does G almost surely contain a copy of Q_d?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Riordan 2000)\n\n**Strengthening:** Even p > 1/4 suffices (Riordan 2000)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the hypercube Q_d, random graph model G(n,p), and 'almost surely' containment. Riordan's theorem is axiomatized for any p > 1/4, from which the original p = 1/2 conjecture follows immediately. The proof also captures the normal distribution of hypercube copies.",
