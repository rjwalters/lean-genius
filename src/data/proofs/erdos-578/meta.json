Solved by Riordan \\cite{Ri00}, who in fact proved this with any edge-probability $>1/4$, and proves that the number of copies of $Q_d$ is normally distributed.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ri00] Riordan, Oliver, Spanning subgraphs of random graphs.
