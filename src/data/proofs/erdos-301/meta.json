    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked for the maximum subset of {1,...,N} avoiding Egyptian fraction decompositions among its elements. The interval (N/2, N] avoids all such decompositions, giving f(N) ≥ N/2. Van Doorn showed f(N) ≤ (25/28+o(1))N. The conjecture is f(N) = (1/2+o(1))N. Related to Problems 302 and 327.",
    "problemStatement": "Estimate f(N), the max |A| for A ⊆ {1,...,N} with no 1/a = Σ 1/bᵢ using distinct elements of A.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define HasEgyptianDecomp for unit fraction decomposition, EgyptFractionFree for avoidance, and maxEgyptFree as the extremal function. The main conjecture asserts f(N) ~ N/2. Lower and upper bounds are axioms. Basic monotonicity is proved.",
