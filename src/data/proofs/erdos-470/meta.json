Are there infinitely many primitive weird numbers, i.e. those such that no proper divisor of $n$ is weird?\n\n\n\nWeird numbers were investigated by Benkoski and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{BeEr74}, who proved that the set of weird numbers has positive density. The smallest weird number is $70$.\n\nMelfi \\cite{Me15} has proved that there are infinitely many primitive weird numbers, conditional on the fact that $p_{n+1}-p_n<\\frac{1}{10}p_n^{1/2}$ for all large $n$, which in turn would follow from well-known conjectures concerning prime gaps.\n\nThe sequence of weird numbers is A006037 in the OEIS. Fang \\cite{Fa22} has shown there are no odd weird numbers below $10^{21}$, and Liddy and Riedl \\cite{LiRi18} have shown that an odd weird number must have at least 6 prime divisors.\n\nIf there are no odd weird numbers then every weird number has abundancy index $<4$ (see [825]).\n\nSee also [825].\n\nThis is problem B2 in Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04} (the \\$10 is reported by Guy, offered by Erd\\H{o}s for a solution to the question of whether any odd weird numbers exist).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BeEr74] Benkoski, S.
