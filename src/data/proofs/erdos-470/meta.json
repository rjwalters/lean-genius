  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A number n is called **weird** if it is abundant (σ(n) > 2n, or equivalently the sum of proper divisors exceeds n) but not pseudoperfect (n cannot be written as the sum of any subset of its proper divisors). Weird numbers are the 'leftover' abundant numbers that can't achieve self-representation.\n\nWeird numbers were introduced and studied by Benkoski and Erdős [BeEr74], who proved that weird numbers have **positive asymptotic density**—a surprising result meaning a positive fraction of all integers are weird.\n\nThe smallest weird number is **70**:\n- Divisors of 70: 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35, 70\n- σ(70) = 144 > 140 = 2×70 ✓ (abundant)\n- No subset of {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35} sums to exactly 70 ✓ (not pseudoperfect)\n\nThe sequence of weird numbers (OEIS A006037) begins: 70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272, ...\n\n**Remarkably, all known weird numbers are even!** This leads to Erdős's first question.",
    "problemStatement": "**Two OPEN Questions from Erdős**:\n\n1. **Odd Weird Numbers**: Are there any odd weird numbers?\n   - All weird numbers found so far are even\n   - Fang (2022) showed: No odd weird below 10^21\n   - Liddy-Riedl (2018) showed: Any odd weird must have at least 6 prime divisors\n\n2. **Primitive Weird Numbers**: Are there infinitely many primitive weird numbers?\n   - A weird number is **primitive** if none of its proper divisors is weird\n   - 70 is trivially primitive (no weird numbers below it)\n   - Melfi (2015) proved infinitely many primitive weirds exist conditionally on a prime gap hypothesis\n\n**Status**: Both questions remain OPEN as of 2024.\n\n**Erdős offered $10 for solving the odd weird question.**",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize both open questions by:\n\n1. **Defining the divisor sum function**: σ(n) = Σ_{d|n} d using Mathlib's divisors\n\n2. **Defining abundance**: n is abundant iff σ(n) > 2n\n\n3. **Defining pseudoperfectness**: n is pseudoperfect iff some subset of its proper divisors sums to n\n\n4. **Defining weirdness**: n is weird iff n is abundant AND n is not pseudoperfect\n\n5. **Defining primitive weirdness**: n is primitive weird iff n is weird AND no proper divisor of n is weird\n\n6. **Stating the open questions**:\n   - erdos_470_part1: ∃ n, IsWeird n ∧ Odd n\n   - erdos_470_part2: PrimitiveWeirdSet.Infinite\n\n7. **Recording known results as axioms**: Benkoski-Erdős density, Fang bound, Liddy-Riedl, Melfi conditional",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Why 70 is weird**: The proper divisors {1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 14, 35} sum to 74 > 70 (abundant), but no subset sums to exactly 70. Key observation: 35 is needed (without it, max sum is 39), but with 35 you need the remaining divisors to sum to 35, which is impossible from {1,2,5,7,10,14}.",
      "**Positive density paradox**: Despite being unable to represent themselves as subset sums, weird numbers are actually common! Benkoski and Erdős proved they have positive density, meaning infinitely many exist with positive proportion.",
      "**The parity mystery**: Every weird number found is even. If odd weird numbers exist, they must be astronomically large (>10^21) and have complex structure (≥6 prime divisors). This is problem B2 in Guy's UPINT.",
      "**Primitive vs non-primitive**: A weird number n is non-primitive if some proper divisor d is also weird. In that case, n = 2^k × d for some k might preserve weirdness. Primitive weirds can't be 'generated' this way.",
      "**Melfi's conditional result**: If prime gaps satisfy p_{n+1} - p_n < √p_n/10 (implied by Cramér's conjecture), then infinitely many primitive weird numbers exist. This connects weird numbers to prime distribution!",
      "**Connection to abundancy**: The abundancy index σ(n)/n measures 'how abundant' n is. If no odd weirds exist, all weirds have abundancy < 4."
