The answer is yes, as shown by Odlyzko (although no reference is given).\n\nWatts has suggested that perhaps the obvious greedy algorithm defines such a permutation - that is, let $a_1=1$ and let\\[a_{n+1}=\\min \\{ x : a_n+x\\textrm{ is prime and }x\\neq a_i\\textrm{ for }i\\leq n\\}.\\]In other words, do all positive integers occur as some such $a_n$? Do all primes occur as a sum?\n\nIn the comments van Doorn has noted that the answer to the latter question is no, since $197$ does not appear as a sum from such a greedy sequence.\n\nIn \\cite{ErGr80} they also note that Segal asked the finite version: is there, for all $n\\geq 2$, a permutation $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$ of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that $a_k+a_{k+1}$ is prime for $1\\leq k<n$. The answer is likely yes on probabilistic grounds, and is true for infinitely many $n$ (see this discussion).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
