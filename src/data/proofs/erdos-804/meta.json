In particular, is it true that $f((\\log n)^2,n) \\geq n^{1/2-o(1)}$? Is it true that $f((\\log n)^3,n)\\gg (\\log n)^3$?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal. Alon and Sudakov \\cite{AlSu07} proved that in fact\\[\\frac{(\\log n)^2}{\\log\\log n}\\ll f((\\log n)^2,n) \\ll (\\log n)^2\\]and\\[f((\\log n)^3,n)\\asymp \\frac{(\\log n)^2}{\\log\\log n}.\\]See also [805].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AlSu07] Alon, Noga and Sudakov, Benny, On graphs with subgraphs having large independence numbers.
