  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #804** was posed by Erdős and Hajnal as part of their study of local-to-global structure in graphs. The question asks: if every small induced subgraph has a good independent set, how good must the global independent set be?\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1991 (Erdős [Er91]):** Posed the problem with conjectured bounds.\n- **2007 (Alon-Sudakov [AlSu07]):** Completely resolved both questions in the NEGATIVE. The conjectured bounds were far too optimistic.\n\n**Key Insight:** Local independent set structure does NOT propagate as strongly to global structure as Erdős and Hajnal expected. The true bounds involve an extra log log n factor in the denominator.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet $f(m, n)$ be maximal such that any graph on $n$ vertices in which every induced subgraph on $m$ vertices has an independent set of size $\\geq \\log n$ must contain an independent set of size $\\geq f(n)$.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Is $f((\\log n)^2, n) \\geq n^{1/2 - o(1)}$?\n2. Is $f((\\log n)^3, n) \\gg (\\log n)^3$?\n\n**Answers: BOTH NO!** (Alon-Sudakov, 2007)\n\n**True Bounds:**\n$$\\frac{(\\log n)^2}{\\log \\log n} \\ll f((\\log n)^2, n) \\ll (\\log n)^2$$\n$$f((\\log n)^3, n) \\asymp \\frac{(\\log n)^2}{\\log \\log n}$$",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define independent sets, independence number α(G), and local independence property.\n\n2. **False Conjectures:** Axiomatize that both Erdős-Hajnal conjectures are false.\n\n3. **True Bounds:** Axiomatize Alon-Sudakov's upper and lower bounds showing the correct answer involves (log n)² / log log n.\n\n4. **Intuition:** Explain why random graphs provide counterexamples.\n\n5. **Related Results:** Connection to Problem #805 and the different Erdős-Hajnal conjecture.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #804 asked two questions about how local independent set structure propagates globally. Both conjectures were DISPROVED by Alon and Sudakov (2007). The true bounds are (log n)² / log log n, far smaller than the conjectured n^(1/2-o(1)) and (log n)³. This demonstrates that local structure doesn't force global structure as strongly as intuition might suggest.",
    "implications": "**Implications for Extremal Graph Theory**\n\n1. **Local-Global Gap:** The gap between local and global independent set structure is larger than expected.\n\n2. **Polylogarithmic vs Polynomial:** The true answer is polylogarithmic, not polynomial in n.\n\n3. **Log Log Factor:** The mysterious log log n appears in tight bounds, a common phenomenon in extremal combinatorics.\n\n4. **Random Constructions:** Random graphs continue to provide extremal examples.",
