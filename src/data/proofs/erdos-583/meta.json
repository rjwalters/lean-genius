  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This conjecture was posed by Erdős and Gallai around 1959 and remains one of the oldest open problems in graph decomposition theory. The problem asks whether every connected graph on n vertices can be partitioned into at most ⌈n/2⌉ edge-disjoint paths, where the edges of each path are used exactly once across all paths.\n\nSubstantial progress has been made toward understanding path and cycle decompositions. Lovász (1968) proved that every graph can be partitioned into at most ⌊n/2⌋ edge-disjoint paths and cycles, which implies every graph can be partitioned into at most n-1 paths. Chung (1978) showed that connected graphs can be partitioned into at most ⌈n/2⌉ edge-disjoint trees, and Pyber (1996) proved that connected graphs can be covered by n/2 + O(n^{3/4}) paths.\n\nFan (2002) made a major breakthrough by proving that the conjecture holds if we drop the edge-disjoint requirement—that is, connected graphs can be covered by ⌈n/2⌉ paths (with possible edge overlaps). However, the full edge-disjoint version remains stubbornly open after more than 60 years.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices. The **Erdős-Gallai conjecture** asks: can the edges of $G$ always be partitioned into at most $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$ edge-disjoint paths?\n\n**Status**: OPEN - This is a falsifiable conjecture that could potentially be disproven by exhibiting a counterexample.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the key structures for path partitions in Mathlib's SimpleGraph framework: GraphPath (sequences of adjacent vertices), PathPartition (edge-disjoint collections covering all edges), and PathCover (covering without disjointness). The main conjecture is stated as ErdosGallaiConjecture, and related results by Lovász, Chung, Pyber, and Fan are included as axioms. The formalization also connects to Hajós' conjecture about cycle decompositions of Eulerian graphs.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Edge-disjoint vs. covering**: Fan proved the covering version (allowing edge overlaps), but the edge-disjoint partition version remains open. This gap is the key unsolved difficulty.",
      "**Paths vs. paths-and-cycles**: Lovász's ⌊n/2⌋ bound for paths and cycles together shows the challenge is specifically about avoiding cycles.",
      "**Tree decompositions**: Chung's theorem gives ⌈n/2⌉ edge-disjoint trees, showing the bound is achievable for more flexible structures.",
      "**Asymptotic near-miss**: Pyber's n/2 + O(n^{3/4}) result is tantalizingly close but doesn't settle the exact bound.",
      "**Hajós connection**: The related conjecture for Eulerian graphs (even-degree vertices) and cycle decompositions shows deep connections in graph decomposition theory."
