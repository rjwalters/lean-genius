Lov\\'{a}sz \\cite{Lo68} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into at most $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ edge-disjoint paths and cycles, which implies that every graph can be partitioned into at most $n-1$ paths.\n\nChung \\cite{Ch78} proved that every connected graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into at most $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$ edge-disjoint trees. Pyber \\cite{Py96} has shown that every connected graph on $n$ vertices can be covered by at most $n/2+O(n^{3/4})$ paths.\n\nIf we drop the edge-disjoint condition then this conjecture was proved by Fan \\cite{Fa02}.\n\nHajos \\cite{Lo68} has conjectured that if $G$ has all degrees even then $G$ can be partitioned into at most $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ edge-disjoint cycles.\n\nSee also [184] for an analogous problem decomposing into edges and cycles and [1017] for decomposing into complete graphs.
