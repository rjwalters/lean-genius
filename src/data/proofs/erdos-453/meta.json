Selfridge conjectured the answer is no, contrary to Erd\\H{o}s and Straus. The answer is no, as shown by Pomerance \\cite{Po79}, who proved there are infinitely many $n$ such that\\[p_n^2 > p_{n+i}p_{n-i}\\]for all $i<n$. Pomerance's proof is short enough to reproduce here:\n\nLet $0<a_1<a_2<\\cdots$ be any sequence with $a_n=o(n)$. Consider the boundary of the convex hull of the points $(n,a_n)$. The fact that $a_n/n\\to 0$ implies that the non-horizontal portion of the boundary of the convex hull is concave and has infinitely many vertices. Considering these vertices as $(n,a_n)$ produces infinitely many $n$ such that $2a_n > a_{n-i}+a_{n+i}$ for all $i<n$. We may then choose $a_n=\\log p_n$.\n\nThis is the topic of problem A14 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
