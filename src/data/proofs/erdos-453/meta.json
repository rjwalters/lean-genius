  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Straus originally conjectured that for all large n, some i < n satisfies p_n² < p_{n+i}·p_{n-i}. Selfridge disagreed, conjecturing the opposite. Pomerance (1979) proved Selfridge correct using an elegant convex hull argument on the prime number graph. This is Problem A14 in Guy's 'Unsolved Problems in Number Theory'.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that, for all sufficiently large n, there exists some i < n such that p_n² < p_{n+i}·p_{n-i}, where p_k is the k-th prime?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the Erdős-Straus conjecture and Selfridge's counter-conjecture. Pomerance's proof uses the convex hull of points (n, log p_n): since log p_n / n → 0, the boundary has infinitely many vertices where 2·log p_n > log p_{n-i} + log p_{n+i}, which implies p_n² > p_{n+i}·p_{n-i}.",

      "Convex hull vertices correspond to primes violating the Erdős-Straus conjecture",
