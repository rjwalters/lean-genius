  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Davis, Entringer, Graham, and Simmons (1977) proved every permutation has a monotone 3-AP but showed 5-APs can be avoided. The k=4 case remains open, positioned at the critical threshold. LeSaulnier and Vijay (2011) showed odd-CD 4-APs are avoidable, reducing the problem to even-CD 4-APs.",
    "problemStatement": "Must every permutation of ℕ contain a monotone 4-term arithmetic progression?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize APs in permutations, the main conjecture, DEGS results for k=3 and k=5, common difference parity analysis, non-extendability constraints, and the Erdős–Szekeres connection.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "k=3: always exists (DEGS 1977); k=5: can be avoided (DEGS 1977)",
      "k=4 is the critical threshold between existence and avoidability",
