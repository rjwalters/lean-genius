He later retracted this claim in \\cite{Er85e}, saying \"The theorem is no doubt correct and perhaps will not be difficult to prove but I never was able to reconstruct my 'proof' which perhaps never existed .\"\n\nThe existence of such an $\\alpha$ was established by Champagne, Le, Liu, and Wooley \\cite{CLLW24}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CLLW24] J.
