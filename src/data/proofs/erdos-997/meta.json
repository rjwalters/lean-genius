  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #997: Well-Distributed Sequences and Prime Multiples**\n\nThe concept of well-distributed sequences was introduced by Hlawka and Petersen in 1955, strengthening the classical notion of equidistribution. A sequence is well-distributed if it becomes uniformly distributed at a rate that is uniform over all starting points.\n\n**Erdős's Work:**\n- Erdős proved that for any lacunary sequence (nₖ), the sequence {αnₖ} is not well-distributed for almost all α\n- In 1964, he claimed to have proved existence of an irrational α for which {αpₙ} is not well-distributed\n- He retracted this claim in 1985, memorably writing \"The theorem is no doubt correct... but I never was able to reconstruct my 'proof' which perhaps never existed\"\n\n**2024 Breakthrough:**\nChampagne, Le, Liu, and Wooley proved that such an α does exist, validating Erdős's intuition after 60 years.\n\n**Current Status:**\nThe existence question is resolved, but Erdős's full problem—whether this holds for ALL α—remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nCall a sequence $x_1, x_2, \\ldots \\in (0,1)$ **well-distributed** if for every $\\epsilon > 0$, when $k$ is sufficiently large:\n$$|\\#\\{n < m \\leq n+k : x_m \\in I\\} - |I| \\cdot k| < \\epsilon k$$\nfor all $n > 0$ and all intervals $I \\subseteq [0,1]$.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that for every $\\alpha$, the sequence $\\{\\alpha p_n\\}$ (fractional parts of $\\alpha$ times primes) is **not** well-distributed?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- Existence: YES, there exists such an $\\alpha$ (CLLW, 2024)\n- Universality: OPEN (does it hold for all $\\alpha$?)\n\n**Key Distinction:**\n- Well-distribution is strictly stronger than equidistribution\n- Vinogradov showed $\\{\\alpha p_n\\}$ IS equidistributed for irrational $\\alpha$\n- But equidistribution does not imply well-distribution",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Fractional Parts:** Define frac(x) = x - ⌊x⌋ and prove it lies in [0,1)\n\n2. **Well-Distribution:** Define the precise ε-k-n-I condition from Hlawka-Petersen\n\n3. **Prime Sequence:** Use Nat.nth to define the sequence of primes\n\n4. **Prime Multiples:** Define primeMultipleSequence(α) = n ↦ frac(α · pₙ)\n\n5. **Lacunary Sequences:** Define lacunary property and state Erdős's theorem for them\n\n6. **CLLW Theorem:** Axiomatize the 2024 existence result\n\n7. **Conjecture:** State Erdos997Conjecture as ∀α, ¬WellDistributed(primeMultipleSequence α)\n\n8. **Discrepancy:** Connect well-distribution to the discrepancy function",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Well vs Equidistribution:** Well-distribution requires uniform distribution to hold starting from any position n, not just from the beginning. This is strictly stronger.",
      "**Primes Are Not Lacunary:** The ratio pₙ₊₁/pₙ → 1 by the prime number theorem, so primes don't satisfy the lacunary condition (ratio bounded away from 1).",
      "**Erdős's Retraction:** Erdős's honesty in retracting his 1964 claim is notable—he admitted the proof 'perhaps never existed.'",
      "**60 Years Later:** The CLLW 2024 paper resolved the existence question that Erdős had attempted, vindicating his intuition.",
      "**Diophantine Connection:** The problem connects to how well α can be approximated by rationals with prime denominators."

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #997 asks whether the sequence {αpₙ} of fractional parts of prime multiples is non-well-distributed for ALL α. The 2024 result by Champagne-Le-Liu-Wooley shows existence of such an α, validating Erdős's retracted 1964 claim. The universal statement remains open.",
    "implications": "**Connections to Other Areas**\n\n1. **Discrepancy Theory:** Well-distribution is equivalent to uniform discrepancy bounds across all starting points\n\n2. **Diophantine Approximation:** Connected to approximation of α by rationals with prime denominators\n\n3. **Prime Distribution:** The irregularity of prime gaps may force non-well-distribution regardless of α\n\n4. **Metric Number Theory:** The behavior for 'generic' α vs all α may differ\n\n5. **Equidistribution Theory:** Shows the gap between equidistribution and stronger uniformity conditions",

      "Does the conjecture hold for all irrational α?",
      "What is the Lebesgue measure of the set of α for which {αpₙ} is well-distributed?",

      "Is there a connection to the distribution of prime gaps?",
      "What about other subsequences of primes (e.g., primes in arithmetic progressions)?"
