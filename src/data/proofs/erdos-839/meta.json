  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about sequences where no term is the sum of consecutive earlier terms. He conjectured that such sequences must be sparse (lim sup aₙ/n = ∞) and have vanishing logarithmic density. He also conjectured the upper density is at most 1/2, which Freud disproved with a construction achieving 19/36.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 ≤ a₁ < a₂ < ... be integers where no aₘ equals aᵢ + aᵢ₊₁ + ... + aⱼ for i ≤ j < m. (1) Is lim sup(aₙ/n) = ∞? (2) Does (1/log x)·Σ_{aₙ<x} 1/aₙ → 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define consecutive-term sum avoidance, formalize both growth-rate questions, record Erdős's observations about achievable lower bounds, and state Freud's counterexample showing upper density can exceed 1/2.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Consecutive-sum avoidance is stronger than avoiding all subset sums — it only forbids contiguous blocks",
      "lim inf(aₙ/n) < ∞ is achievable, so the sequence can be dense infinitely often",
      "Erdős's conjecture that upper density ≤ 1/2 was disproved by Freud (19/36 ≈ 0.528)",
      "The reciprocal sum Σ 1/aₙ can grow at least as c·log log x",
      "Related to Problems #359 (sum-free sets) and #867"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #839 poses two open questions about the sparsity of sequences avoiding consecutive-term sums. While Freud disproved the upper density conjecture, both growth-rate questions remain unresolved.",
    "implications": "Resolution would clarify the structure of additive avoidance constraints, connecting to Sidon sets, sum-free sets, and additive number theory more broadly.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is lim sup(aₙ/n) = ∞ for all valid sequences?",
      "Does the logarithmic density (1/log x)·Σ 1/aₙ vanish?",
      "What is the maximum possible upper density of a valid sequence?",
      "Is Freud's 19/36 the supremum, or can it be improved?"
