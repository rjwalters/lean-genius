  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This function was introduced by Ecklund, Erdős, and Selfridge in 1974. The binomial coefficient C(n,k) typically has many small prime factors—finding when all primes dividing it exceed k connects to smooth number theory. The function g(k) is highly irregular, related to OEIS sequence A003458.",
    "problemStatement": "Let g(k) > k+1 be the smallest n such that all prime factors of C(n,k) are greater than k. Estimate g(k).",
    "proofStrategy": "The bounds have evolved: original polynomial lower bound k^{1+c} was improved to exp(c·(log k)²) by Konyagin (1999). The upper bound exp((1+o(1))k) has not been improved. The gap is enormous, and the heuristic log g(k) ~ k/log k remains unproven.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "g(k) finds where C(n,k) is 'k-rough' (all prime factors > k)",
      "For small n, primes p ≤ k typically divide C(n,k) via Kummer's theorem",
      "The function is highly irregular: g(k+1)/g(k) is unbounded above and below",
      "lcm(1,...,k) ~ exp(k) provides a natural upper bound conjecture",
      "Computed values: g(2)=3, g(3)=7, g(4)=23, g(5)=62, g(6)=143"

    "summary": "The Erdős-Selfridge function g(k) measures when binomial coefficients become k-rough. Despite progress on bounds, the true growth rate remains unknown. The heuristic log g(k) ~ k/log k is widely believed but unproven.",
    "implications": "This connects to smooth number theory, prime distribution in factorials, and the structure of binomial coefficients. Understanding g(k) would illuminate the arithmetic of C(n,k).",
