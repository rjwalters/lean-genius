  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is a canonical Ramsey theory problem from Erdős-Graham [ErGr79, p.333; ErGr80, p.17]. Unlike van der Waerden numbers W(k) (which require monochromatic APs only), H(k) allows rainbow APs as an alternative 'win condition'. The existence of H(k) follows from Szemerédi's theorem: for N large enough, either pigeonhole forces a monochromatic AP, or the coloring uses enough colors for a rainbow AP. The known result H(k)^{1/k} → ∞ is relatively straightforward, but the stronger question H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞ — equivalently, whether H(k) grows faster than k^k — remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let H(k) denote the smallest N such that any finite coloring of {1,...,N} contains either a monochromatic k-term AP or a rainbow k-term AP (all different colors). Estimate H(k), and determine if H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines arithmetic progressions, monochromatic/rainbow colorings, the canonical property, and the H(k) function via Nat.find. Van der Waerden numbers W(k) are similarly defined. Known results (H(k)^{1/k} → ∞, H(k) ≤ W(k), lower bounds) are axioms. The main conjecture H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞ is stated. A summary theorem combines the known results.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "H(k) ≤ W(k) because rainbow APs provide an easier 'win condition' than monochromatic only",
      "H(k)^{1/k} → ∞ is known — the k-th root grows without bound",
      "Whether H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞ (equivalently H(k) > k^k eventually) is open",
      "Rainbow and monochromatic conditions compete via the pigeonhole principle",
      "Existence of H(k) follows from Szemerédi's theorem on APs in dense sets"
