  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is a canonical Ramsey theory problem from Erdős-Graham [ErGr79, ErGr80]. Unlike van der Waerden numbers (monochromatic only), H(k) allows rainbow APs as an alternative win condition. The existence of H(k) follows from Szemerédi's theorem, but precise bounds remain unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Let H(k) denote the smallest N such that any finite coloring of {1,...,N} contains either a monochromatic k-term AP or a rainbow k-term AP (all different colors). Estimate H(k), and determine if H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines arithmetic progressions, monochromatic and rainbow colorings, the canonical property, and the H(k) function. Known results about H(k)^{1/k} → ∞ and comparisons with van der Waerden numbers are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "H(k) ≤ W(k) because rainbow APs give an easier win condition",
      "H(k)^{1/k} → ∞ is known (relatively straightforward)",
      "Whether H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞ (i.e., H(k) > k^k eventually) is open",
      "Rainbow and monochromatic compete via pigeonhole principle",
      "Existence follows from Szemerédi's theorem on APs in dense sets"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The problem asks for bounds on H(k), the canonical Ramsey number for k-APs. The key question is whether H(k) grows faster than k^k, expressed as H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞.",
    "implications": "Better bounds on H(k) would illuminate the structure of arithmetic progressions in colored sets and the balance between monochromatic and rainbow patterns.",

      "Does H(k)^{1/k}/k → ∞?",
