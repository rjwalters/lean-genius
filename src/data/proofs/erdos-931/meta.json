  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the prime factorization structure of products of consecutive integers. Erdős expressed doubt about the conjecture, proposing the weaker claim that n₂ > 2(n₁+k₁). AlphaProof found counterexamples to the strong version. Related to Problem 388; discussed in Guy's collection (B35).",
    "problemStatement": "Let k₁ ≥ k₂ ≥ 3. Are there only finitely many n₂ ≥ n₁+k₁ such that ∏_{i=1}^{k₁}(n₁+i) and ∏_{j=1}^{k₂}(n₂+j) have the same set of prime factors?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define consecutiveProduct, consecutivePrimeFactors, and SamePrimeFactors. The main conjecture states finiteness. We also state the stronger conjecture (n₂ > 2(n₁+k₁)), axiomatize the AlphaProof counterexample and Tijdeman's example, and state the open question about primes between n₁ and n₂.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "AlphaProof counterexample: 10! and 14·15·16 share prime factors {2,3,5,7} with n₂ ≤ 2(n₁+k₁)",
      "Tijdeman's example: 19·20·21·22 and 54·55·56·57 share the same prime factors",
      "Erdős could not prove a prime must exist between n₁ and n₂ when products share factors",
      "The stronger conjecture (finiteness for n₂ ≤ 2(n₁+k₁)) has counterexamples but the original remains open"
