  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Sós asked whether the consecutive differences R(3, k+1) − R(3, k) tend to infinity, and whether the growth is sublinear in k. The best known asymptotics for R(3, k) are Θ(k²/log k), established by Kim (1995) for the lower bound and Shearer (1983) / Campos–Griffiths–Morris–Sahasrabudhe (2023) for the upper bound. Both parts of the question remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "Show that R(3, k+1) − R(3, k) → ∞ as k → ∞. Similarly, prove or disprove that R(3, k+1) − R(3, k) = o(k).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatises R(3, k) with known values (k = 3 through 9), monotonicity, and the Kim / Shearer asymptotic bounds. The consecutive difference function and both parts of the conjecture (divergence and sublinearity) are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "R(3, k) = Θ(k²/log k) implies the average difference grows like k/log k",
      "Known values: R(3,3)=6, R(3,4)=9, ..., R(3,9)=36 show irregular gaps",
      "Divergence of differences is expected from the quadratic growth",
      "Sublinearity (o(k)) is the harder open question"
