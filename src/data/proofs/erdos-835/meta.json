This is trivially possible for $k=2$. They were not sure about $k=6$.\n\nThis is equivalent to asking whether there exists $k>2$ such that the chromatic number of the Johnson graph $J(2k,k)$ is $k+1$ (it is always at least $k+1$ and at most $2k$). The chromatic numbers listed at this website show that this is false for $3\\leq k\\leq 8$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
