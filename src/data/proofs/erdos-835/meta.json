    "historicalContext": "**Erdős-Rosenfeld Problem**\n\nErdős and Rosenfeld asked: can the k-subsets of {1,...,2k} be colored with k+1 colors so that every (k+1)-subset contains all colors?\n\nThis is equivalent to asking whether the Johnson graph J(2k,k) has chromatic number exactly k+1.\n\n**Solution:** Computational verification shows χ(J(2k,k)) > k+1 for 3 ≤ k ≤ 8.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nDoes there exist k > 2 such that χ(J(2k,k)) = k+1?\n\n**Answer: NO** (verified for 3 ≤ k ≤ 8)\n\nKnown chromatic numbers:\n- k=2: χ=3 (works!)\n- k=3: χ=4 (fails)\n- k=4: χ=7 (fails)\n- k=5: χ=8 (fails)\n- k=6: χ=11 (fails)\n- k=7: χ=13 (fails)\n- k=8: χ=15 (fails)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Johnson graph:** Define J(n,k) with k-subsets as vertices.\n2. **Erdős-Rosenfeld property:** Rainbow condition on (k+1)-subsets.\n3. **Equivalence:** Show property ↔ χ = k+1.\n4. **Computational results:** Axiomatize known chromatic numbers.\n5. **Main theorem:** erdos_835 shows failure for 3 ≤ k ≤ 8.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #835 is SOLVED (NO for k > 2). The Erdős-Rosenfeld property fails for 3 ≤ k ≤ 8, as the chromatic number of J(2k,k) exceeds k+1. Only k=2 works.",
    "implications": "**Implications**\n\n1. **Subset coloring:** k+1 colors are insufficient for the rainbow property\n2. **Johnson graphs:** Their chromatic numbers grow faster than the lower bound\n3. **Computational combinatorics:** Some problems require computational verification",
