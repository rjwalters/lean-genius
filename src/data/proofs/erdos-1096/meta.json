    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1096** was posed by Erdős and Joó at the 1991 Great Western Number Theory conference. It concerns the structure of q-expansions: numbers that can be written as finite sums Σ q^i.\n\n**Key Historical Developments:**\n- **1990 (Erdős-Joó-Komornik):** Proved Pisot-Vijayaraghavan numbers cannot have gaps → 0. Also showed universal bound: gaps ≤ 1 for 1 < q ≤ 2.\n- **1991 (Great Western):** Erdős and Joó posed the problem, conjecturing the threshold is q₀ ≈ 1.3247.\n- **1996 (Bugeaud):** Characterized Pisot numbers via gap behavior in m-digit expansions.\n- **1996 (Erdős-Joó-Schnitzer):** Refined characterization for q < φ.\n\nThe smallest Pisot number q₀ is the real root of x³ = x + 1, a remarkable algebraic integer discovered by Le Lionnais in 1983.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet $1 < q < 1 + \\varepsilon$ and consider the set of numbers of the form $\\sum_{i \\in S} q^i$ for all finite $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$, ordered by size as $0 = x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \\cdots$.\n\nIs it true that, provided $\\varepsilon > 0$ is sufficiently small, $x_{k+1} - x_k \\to 0$?\n\n**Conjecture:** The threshold is $q_0 \\approx 1.3247$, the smallest Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number.\n\n**Known:**\n- Pisot numbers (including $q_0$) do NOT have this property\n- For all $1 < q \\leq 2$: gaps satisfy $x_{k+1} - x_k \\leq 1$\n\n**Open:** Whether all $1 < q < q_0$ have gaps → 0",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:** Define q-representable numbers as sums of powers of q, the ordered sequence, and gaps.\n\n2. **Pisot Numbers:** Define the Pisot property and the smallest Pisot number q₀.\n\n3. **Gap Property:** Formalize the condition that gaps tend to 0.\n\n4. **Key Results:** Axiomatize Erdős-Joó-Komornik (Pisot ⇒ no gap property, universal bound) and Bugeaud's characterization.\n\n5. **Conjecture:** State the Erdős-Joó conjecture about the threshold at q₀.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1096 asks whether gaps in the sequence of q-representable numbers tend to 0 for q close to 1. Erdős and Joó conjectured the threshold is q₀ ≈ 1.3247, the smallest Pisot number. It's known that Pisot numbers do NOT have this property and that gaps are bounded by 1 for all q ≤ 2, but the exact threshold remains open.",
    "implications": "**Implications for Number Theory**\n\n1. **Pisot Numbers:** The problem reveals deep connections between gaps in q-expansions and algebraic properties of q.\n\n2. **Expansion Structure:** Understanding which q give gaps → 0 illuminates the structure of digital expansions.\n\n3. **Ergodic Theory:** Related to β-expansions and the dynamics of T: x ↦ βx mod 1.\n\n4. **Unique Representations:** Connected to when 1 has a unique expansion, which characterizes Pisot numbers.",
