  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originated with Donald Newman, who conjectured that for any sequence x₁, x₂, ... in [0, 1], there must be infinitely many pairs (m, n) where |x_{m+n} - x_m| ≤ 1/(√5·n). The appearance of √5 is connected to the golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2.\n\nFan Chung and Ronald Graham (1984) proved Newman's conjecture and found something remarkable: the optimal constant is not √5 but rather c = 1 + Σ_{k≥1} 1/F_{2k} ≈ 2.535, where F_m is the m-th Fibonacci number. Since c > √5 ≈ 2.236, their bound 1/c ≈ 0.394 is stronger than Newman's 1/√5 ≈ 0.447.\n\nThe Fibonacci connection is not coincidental. The golden ratio φ has continued fraction [1; 1, 1, 1, ...], making it the 'worst approximable' irrational number. Fibonacci numbers F_n/F_{n-1} give the best rational approximations to φ. This worst-case behavior for φ translates into the optimal constant for sequence approximation.",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdős Problem #480**: Let $x_1, x_2, \\ldots \\in [0, 1]$ be an infinite sequence. Is it true that\n$$\\inf_n \\liminf_{m \\to \\infty} n|x_{m+n} - x_m| \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\approx 0.447?$$\n\n**Status**: SOLVED by Chung and Graham (1984)\n\n**Stronger Result**: The optimal constant is\n$$c = 1 + \\sum_{k \\geq 1} \\frac{1}{F_{2k}} = 2.535\\ldots$$\nwhere $F_m$ is the $m$-th Fibonacci number. The bound $1/c \\approx 0.394$ is best possible.",
    "proofStrategy": "Our formalization takes a structured approach:\n\n1. **Define the setting**: Unit interval sequences and 'good pairs' (m, n) satisfying the approximation.\n\n2. **Axiomatize main results**: Newman's conjecture and the Chung-Graham theorem are stated as axioms since their proofs require sophisticated analysis beyond Mathlib.\n\n3. **Verify the golden ratio**: We prove algebraic identities like φ² = φ + 1 and φ·ψ = -1 (where ψ is the conjugate).\n\n4. **Compare constants**: We verify √5 < c using calc chains with Real.sqrt_lt_sqrt.\n\n5. **Provide examples**: Constant sequences trivially satisfy the bound; we verify basic sequence properties.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The golden ratio connection**: φ = (1+√5)/2 has the 'worst' Diophantine approximation properties. Its continued fraction [1;1,1,...] converges slowest.",
      "**Fibonacci optimality**: The constant c = 1 + Σ 1/F_{2k} arises because Fibonacci ratios F_n/F_{n-1} are the best rational approximations to φ.",
      "**√5 vs c**: Newman asked about 1/√5 ≈ 0.447, but Chung-Graham proved the tighter bound 1/c ≈ 0.394. Since c ≈ 2.535 > √5 ≈ 2.236, their result is stronger.",
      "**Extremal sequences**: The sequences achieving the worst case are related to Sturmian sequences - binary sequences encoding irrational rotations on the circle.",
      "**Universality**: The result holds for ALL sequences in [0,1] - there's no escape from having infinitely many good approximation pairs."
