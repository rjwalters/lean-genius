  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originated from Erdős's 1949 paper 'On the strong law of large numbers', where he studied the behavior of sums involving fractional parts of lacunary sequences. A sequence n₁ < n₂ < ⋯ is lacunary if n_{k+1}/n_k ≥ q > 1 for all k.\n\nErdős proved both lower and upper bounds: he constructed examples where the sum grows at least as fast as N(log log N)^{1/2-ε}, and proved that for all lacunary sequences it grows at most as o(N(log N)^{1/2+ε}).\n\nIn his 1964 paper on Diophantine approximations, Erdős stated he believed the lower bound is closer to the truth. The gap between (log log N) and (log N) in the exponents remains unresolved.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem**: Let $n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots$ be a lacunary sequence of integers and $f \\in L^2([0,1])$. Estimate the growth of, for almost all $\\alpha$:\n$$\\sum_{1 \\leq k \\leq N} f(\\{\\alpha n_k\\})$$\n\nIs it true that for almost all $\\alpha$:\n$$\\sum_{1 \\leq k \\leq N} f(\\{\\alpha n_k\\}) = o(N\\sqrt{\\log\\log N})?$$\n\n**Known Bounds**:\n- Lower: $\\limsup \\geq N(\\log\\log N)^{1/2-\\epsilon}$ for some examples\n- Upper: Always $o(N(\\log N)^{1/2+\\epsilon})$\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines lacunary sequences (n_{k+1} ≥ q·n_k for q > 1) and the sum ∑f({α n_k}). The main conjecture is stated using measure-theoretic 'almost everywhere' (∀ᵐ). Lower and upper bounds are axiomatized based on Erdős's 1949 and 1964 papers. Examples show 2^k and 3^k are lacunary.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Lacunary means gaps grow**: n_{k+1}/n_k ≥ q > 1, so terms grow at least exponentially.",
      "**Fractional parts are equidistributed**: For irrational α, {α n_k} is equidistributed in [0,1].",
      "**The gap in bounds**: Lower has (log log N)^{1/2}, upper has (log N)^{1/2} - a huge difference!",
      "**Erdős's intuition**: He believed the lower bound is closer to truth, suggesting upper bound can be improved.",
      "**Connection to probability**: The sum behaves like a random walk, with variance growing with N."

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #995 asks for the precise growth rate of sums ∑f({α n_k}) for lacunary sequences. The known bounds leave a gap: the lower bound involves (log log N)^{1/2} while the upper bound involves (log N)^{1/2}. Erdős conjectured the lower bound is closer to the truth. The problem remains OPEN.",
    "implications": "This problem sits at the intersection of analysis, probability, and number theory. It connects to the Strong Law of Large Numbers, equidistribution of fractional parts, and metric Diophantine approximation. Resolving the gap would illuminate the fine structure of lacunary sums.",
