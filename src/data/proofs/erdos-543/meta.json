    "problemStatement": "Define $f(N)$ be the minimal $k$ such that the following holds: if $G$ is an abelian group of size $N$ and $A\\subseteq G$ is a random set of size $k$ then, with probability $\\geq 1/2$, all elements of $G$ can be written as $\\sum_{x\\in S}x$ for some $S\\subseteq A$. Is\\[f(N) \\leq \\log_2 N+o(\\log\\log N)?\\] Erdős and Rényi [ErRe65] proved that\\[f(N) \\leq \\log_2N+O(\\log\\log N).\\]Erdős believed improving this to $o(\\log\\log N)$ is impossible.
