  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears as B24 in Guy's 'Unsolved Problems in Number Theory' (2004). Lebensold (1976) established tight bounds 0.6725n ≤ f(n) ≤ 0.6736n for large n. The basic lower bound f(n) ≥ ⌈2n/3⌉ ≈ 0.667n comes from the interval [m+1, 3m+2].",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be the maximum size of A ⊆ {1,…,n} such that no element divides two distinct others. How large is f(n)? Is lim f(n)/n irrational?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define NoDividesTwoOthers (the combinatorial condition) and maxNDTOSize (the extremal function). The lower bound from [m+1, 3m+2] and Lebensold's bounds are axiomatized. ErdosProblem1062 asks whether the limiting density is irrational. Comparison with primitive sets shows the condition is strictly weaker.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The 'no divides two others' condition allows one divisibility but forbids two",
      "The interval [m+1, 3m+2] gives f(n) ≥ 2n/3 since ratios stay below 3",
      "Lebensold's bounds narrow the density to [0.6725, 0.6736]",
      "Whether the limiting density is rational or irrational remains open"
