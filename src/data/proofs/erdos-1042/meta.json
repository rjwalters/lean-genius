    "historicalContext": "**Polynomial Lemniscates and Component Counting**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian in their 1958 paper on metric properties of polynomials. A lemniscate is the level set {z : |f(z)| < r} of a polynomial - these curves have been studied since Bernoulli.\n\n**The Core Question**: Given a closed set F ⊆ ℂ with transfinite diameter d, if we form polynomials f(z) = ∏(z - zᵢ) with all roots zᵢ ∈ F, how many connected components can the lemniscate {z : |f(z)| < 1} have?\n\n**The 1958 Result**: Erdős-Herzog-Piranian showed that for the unit disc (d = 1), the lemniscate can have n connected components. The example f(z) = z^n + 1 demonstrates this.\n\n**The Open Questions**:\n1. What happens for sets not contained in any disc of radius 1?\n2. If d < 1, are components bounded by (1-c)n for some c > 0?\n\nThese questions remained open for over 65 years until Ghosh-Ramachandran's complete solution in 2024.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet F ⊆ ℂ be a closed set of transfinite diameter d. For a polynomial f(z) = ∏ᵢ(z - zᵢ) with all zᵢ ∈ F, consider the lemniscate L = {z : |f(z)| < 1}.\n\n**Question 1**: If d = 1 and F is not contained in any disc of radius 1, can L have n connected components?\n\n**Question 2**: If d < 1, must L have at most (1-c)n connected components for some c > 0 depending on F?\n\n**Transfinite Diameter**: ρ(F) = lim_{n→∞} sup_{z₁,...,zₙ∈F} (∏_{i<j} |zᵢ-zⱼ|)^{1/C(n,2)}\n\n**Status**: SOLVED by Ghosh-Ramachandran (2024)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Solution Overview**\n\nGhosh and Ramachandran (2024) completely resolved the problem:\n\n**Result 1**: If 0 < d < 1, then L has at most (1-c)n connected components for some c > 0 depending on F. This confirms Question 2.\n\n**Result 2**: If d ≤ 1/4 and F is connected, then L has only ONE connected component.\n\n**Result 3**: For d = 1, there exist sets F such that L can have n components for infinitely many n.\n\n**Key Insight**: The answer cannot depend only on the transfinite diameter!\n- F₁ = {z : |z| ≤ 1/2} has d = 1/2, always gives 1 component\n- F₂ = [-1,1] also has d = 1/2, but can give many components\n\n**Techniques**:\n- Potential theory and logarithmic capacity\n- Winding numbers and the argument principle\n- Chebyshev polynomial theory",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1042, posed by Erdős-Herzog-Piranian in 1958, asked about connected components of polynomial lemniscates. Ghosh-Ramachandran (2024) completely solved it: for d < 1, components are bounded by (1-c)n; for d ≤ 1/4 and connected F, only one component exists; for d = 1, n components are achievable. The key insight is that geometry, not just diameter, determines the answer.",
