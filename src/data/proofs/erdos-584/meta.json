Are there subgraphs $H_1,H_2\\subseteq G$ such that\n{UL}\n{LI}$H_1$ has $\\gg \\delta^3n^2$ edges and every two edges in $H_1$ are contained in a cycle of length at most $6$, and furthermore if two edges share a vertex they are on a cycle of length $4$, and\n{LI}$H_2$ has $\\gg \\delta^2n^2$ edges and every two edges in $H_2$ are contained in a cycle of length at most $8$.\n{/UL}\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Duke, and R\\\"{o}dl. Duke and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{DuEr83}, who proved the first if $n$ is sufficiently large depending on $\\delta$. The real challenge is to prove this when $\\delta=n^{-c}$ for some $c>0$. Duke, Erd\\H{o}s, and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{DER84} proved the first statement with a $\\delta^5$ in place of a $\\delta^3$.\n\nFox and Sudakov \\cite{FoSu08b} have proved the second statement when $\\delta >n^{-1/5}$.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DER84] Duke, Richard and Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and R\\\"{o}dl, Vojt\\vEch, More results on subgraphs with many short cycles.
