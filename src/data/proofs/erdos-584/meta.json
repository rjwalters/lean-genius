  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**The Duke-Erdős Question (1982)**\n\nRichard Duke and Paul Erdős asked in the early 1980s whether dense graphs must contain large subgraphs with strong cycle connectivity properties. Specifically, they sought subgraphs where any two edges lie on a short common cycle.\n\n**Early Results (1984)**\n\nDuke, Erdős, and Rödl proved in 1984 that for graphs with δn² edges, there exists a 6-cycle connected subgraph with δ⁵n² edges. This falls short of the conjectured δ³n² bound.\n\n**Fox-Sudakov Progress (2008)**\n\nJacob Fox and Benny Sudakov proved the H₂ part (8-cycle connectivity with δ²n² edges) when δ > n^{-1/5}. This leaves the sparse regime δ = n^{-c} for larger c as the main open challenge.\n\n**Current Status**\n\nThe full conjecture remains OPEN. The gap between δ⁵ (known) and δ³ (conjectured) for H₁ is significant. The sparse regime where δ = n^{-c} is particularly challenging.",
