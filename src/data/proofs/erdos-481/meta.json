For any finite sequence of $n$ (not necessarily distinct) integers $A=(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ let $T(A)$ denote the sequence of length $rn$ given by\\[(a_ix_j+b_i)_{1\\leq j\\leq n, 1\\leq i\\leq r}.\\]Prove that, if $A_1=(1)$ and $A_{i+1}=T(A_i)$, then there must be some $A_k$ with repeated elements.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham write that 'it is surprising that [this problem] offers difficulty'.\n\nThe original formulation of this problem had an extra condition on the minimal element of the sequence $A_k$ being large, but Ryan Alweiss has pointed out that is trivially always satisfied since the minimal element of the sequence must grow by at least $1$ at each stage.\n\nThis is true. This appears to have first been shown by Klarner \\cite{Kl82}, with a generalisation given by Kolpakov and Talambutsa \\cite{KoTa22}. Essentially the same proof was found independently by Barreto in the comment section.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Kl82] Klarner, David A., A sufficient condition for certain semigroups to be free. J.
