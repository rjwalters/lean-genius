    "historicalContext": "**The Erdős-Sós Conjecture**\n\nThis is one of the most famous open problems in extremal graph theory. Proposed by Erdős and Sós around 1963, it asks: how many edges guarantee that a graph contains every possible tree of a given size?\n\n**The Conjecture**: If a graph G on n vertices has more than (k-1)n/2 edges, then G contains every tree on k+1 vertices as a subgraph.\n\n**Equivalently**: Average degree > k-1 forces all trees with k edges.\n\n**Key Developments**:\n- **1963**: Erdős and Sós pose the conjecture\n- **1996**: Brandt-Dobson prove it for girth ≥ 5 graphs\n- **1997**: Saclé-Wozniak prove it for C₄-free graphs\n- **2000**: Wang-Li-Liu prove it when complement has girth ≥ 5\n- **Announced**: Komlós-Sós-Szemerédi claim proof for sufficiently large k (details unpublished)\n\n**Why It Matters**: The conjecture would give a complete answer to the tree Turán problem, determining exactly when any tree must appear as a subgraph.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet n ≥ k+1. Does every graph on n vertices with at least (k-1)n/2 + 1 edges contain every tree on k+1 vertices?\n\n**Equivalent Formulations**:\n1. Average degree > k-1 implies all (k+1)-vertex trees\n2. ex(n, T) ≤ (k-1)n/2 for all trees T with k edges\n3. Every T-free graph has at most (k-1)n/2 edges\n\n**Status**: OPEN (marked as 'falsifiable' - could be disproved by counterexample)\n\n**Best Known Bound**: n(k-1)+1 edges suffice (much weaker than conjectured).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach to Partial Results**\n\nThe various partial results use different techniques:\n\n1. **Girth ≥ 5 (Brandt-Dobson)**: High girth graphs have local tree-like structure, making embedding easier via greedy methods.\n\n2. **C₄-free (Saclé-Wozniak)**: Absence of 4-cycles limits the ways edges can 'cluster', forcing spread-out structure favorable for tree embeddings.\n\n3. **Complement Girth ≥ 5 (Wang-Li-Liu)**: Dense neighborhoods in G (since complement is sparse) allow inductive tree embedding.\n\n4. **Large k (Komlós-Sós)**: Uses the regularity lemma and blow-up lemma for asymptotic embedding.\n\n**Key Difficulty**: Different tree shapes (paths vs stars vs balanced trees) require different embedding strategies, and the conjecture must work for ALL trees simultaneously.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The path P_{k+1} is the 'hardest' tree - it achieves the extremal bound exactly",
      "Stars K_{1,k} are 'easy' - they just need a vertex of degree k",
      "The conjecture is equivalent to saying ex(n,T) ≤ (k-1)n/2 for all trees T",
      "Girth conditions (no short cycles) make the problem tractable",
      "The Komlós-Sós approach works for 'large enough' k, but the threshold is unknown"
