  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #226 concerns the interplay between complex analysis and number theory. Erdős asked whether an entire non-linear function can preserve rationality. Hayman included it as Problem 2.31 in his 1974 collection. Barth and Schneider solved it affirmatively in 1970, proving a stronger result for any pair of countable dense sets. In 1971, they extended it to countable dense subsets of ℂ.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there an entire non-linear function f : ℂ → ℂ such that for all x ∈ ℝ, x ∈ ℚ ↔ f(x) ∈ ℚ? More generally, for any countable dense A, B ⊆ ℝ, does an entire function with f(A) = B exist? SOLVED: YES (Barth-Schneider, 1970).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsEntire, IsTranscendental, IsCountableDense, and proves ℚ is countable dense. ErdosQuestion and GeneralQuestion are formalized. Barth-Schneider theorem is axiomatized. The main results erdos_question_affirmative and general_question_affirmative are derived from the axiom. Extensions to ℂ and the no-polynomial result are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The function must be transcendental — no polynomial can preserve rationality while being non-linear",
      "The function can be made strictly monotone on ℝ",
      "Result holds for ANY pair of countable dense sets, not just ℚ",
      "The theorem extends to countable dense subsets of ℂ (1971)",
      "Construction uses Weierstrass products and interpolation"
