    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #226**\n\nThis problem concerns the interplay between complex analysis and number theory.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős posed the original question about rationality-preserving entire functions\n- Hayman included it as Problem 2.31 in his 1974 collection 'Research problems in function theory'\n- Barth and Schneider solved it affirmatively in 1970\n- They proved a much stronger result: for ANY two countable dense sets A, B ⊂ ℝ, such functions exist\n- In 1971, they extended the result to countable dense subsets of ℂ\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\n- The function must be transcendental (no polynomial works)\n- The construction uses Weierstrass products and careful interpolation\n- The function can be made monotone on ℝ",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nIs there an entire non-linear function f : ℂ → ℂ such that for all x ∈ ℝ:\n\nx is rational ↔ f(x) is rational?\n\n**Generalization:** For any two countable dense sets A, B ⊆ ℝ, is there an entire function with f(A) = B?\n\n**Answer: YES** (Barth-Schneider, 1970)\n\nFor any countable dense sets A, B ⊂ ℝ, there exists a transcendental entire function f such that f(z) ∈ B if and only if z ∈ A (when restricted to ℝ). Taking A = B = ℚ answers the original question.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Entire Functions:** Define IsEntire (differentiable on ℂ), IsTranscendental (not polynomial)\n\n2. **Countable Dense Sets:** Define IsCountableDense, prove ℚ is countable dense\n\n3. **The Questions:** Formalize ErdosQuestion and GeneralQuestion\n\n4. **Barth-Schneider:** Axiomatize their 1970 theorem and monotone version\n\n5. **Main Results:** Derive erdos_question_affirmative from barth_schneider_1970\n\n6. **Extensions:** Axiomatize the 1971 complex extension",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #226 asked whether there exists an entire non-linear function preserving rationality (x ∈ ℚ ↔ f(x) ∈ ℚ). Barth and Schneider (1970) proved YES by establishing a much stronger result: for any two countable dense sets A, B ⊂ ℝ, a transcendental entire function exists mapping A to B. The function can be made monotone on ℝ, and the result extends to ℂ.",
    "implications": "**Complex Analysis Connections**\n\n1. **Transcendental Functions:** The solution requires going beyond polynomials\n\n2. **Weierstrass Theory:** The construction uses Weierstrass products and interpolation\n\n3. **Dense Sets:** Countable dense sets have remarkable flexibility for function mapping\n\n4. **Number-Theoretic Implications:** Shows surprising freedom in relating algebraic and analytic properties\n\n5. **Extensions:** The technique extends to higher-dimensional settings",
