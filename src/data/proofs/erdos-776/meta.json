    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Trotter studied antichains in the power set of [n] with constraints on how many times each set size must appear. For r=1 (no constraint), at most n−2 distinct sizes are achievable for n>3. For r>1, the maximum drops to n−3, but determining the threshold N(r) remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine the threshold N(r) such that for all n ≥ N(r), the maximum number of distinct set sizes in a multiplicity-r antichain in 2^{[n]} is exactly n−3.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize subset families, antichains, distinct size counting, multiplicity constraints, the r=1 and r>1 results, and the threshold conjecture. We prove the exact formula from the upper and lower bounds.",
