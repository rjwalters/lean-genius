Let $P=\\prod_{1\\leq i\\leq n}p_i$. Does there always exist some prime $p$ with $p_n<p<P$ such that $P+p$ is prime?\n\n\n\nA problem of Deaconescu. Erd\\H{o}s expects that the least such prime is much smaller than $P$, and in fact satisfies $p\\leq n^{O(1)}$. Deaconescu has verified this conjecture for $n\\leq 1000$.\n\nWith the usual heuristic, we expect that $P+p$ is prime with 'probability' $\\approx 1/\\log P$, and hence the chance that this fails is $\\ll (1-1/\\log P)^{P-p_n}\\ll \\exp(-n^{-cn})$, using $P=n^{(1+o(1))n}$. As Cambie points out, 'the chances of failing are ridiculously small'.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
