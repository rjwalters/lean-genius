  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Marian Deaconescu and appeared in Erdős's problem collection. The primorial n# = p₁·p₂·...·pₙ is the product of the first n primes, a fundamental object in number theory.\n\nDeaconescu computationally verified the conjecture for all n ≤ 1000. Erdős made a stronger conjecture: not only does such a prime p exist, but the smallest one satisfies p ≤ n^O(1) (polynomial in n, not exponential).\n\nThe heuristic argument is compelling: since primorials grow very fast (roughly e^(n log n)), there are many primes to try in the interval (pₙ, P). Each has 'probability' about 1/log(P) of making P + p prime, so the chance that ALL fail is exponentially small.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Deaconescu)**: Let $p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots < p_n$ be the first $n$ primes, and let $P = p_1 \\cdot p_2 \\cdots p_n$ (the primorial). For all $n \\geq 2$, does there exist a prime $p$ with $p_n < p < P$ such that $P + p$ is also prime?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Verified**: True for $n \\leq 1000$ (Deaconescu)\n\n**Stronger Conjecture** (Erdős): The smallest such prime satisfies $p \\leq n^{O(1)}$.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the conjecture and verify small cases:\n\n1. **Primorial Definition**: Define nthPrime(k) = kth prime and primorial(n) = product of first n primes\n\n2. **Conjecture Statement**: Define validPrimes(n) as primes p in (pₙ, P) with P + p prime. The conjecture says this set is nonempty for n ≥ 2.\n\n3. **Verified Cases**: Prove explicit witnesses for n = 2, 3, 4, 5:\n   - n=2: P=6, p=5 gives 6+5=11 (prime)\n   - n=3: P=30, p=7 gives 30+7=37 (prime)\n   - n=4: P=210, p=13 gives 210+13=223 (prime)\n   - n=5: P=2310, p=23 gives 2310+23=2333 (prime)\n\n4. **OEIS Connection**: Reference sequence A005235 for the smallest valid primes",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Primorial growth**: The primorial grows roughly as e^(n log n) by the Prime Number Theorem, much faster than 2^n.",
      "**Heuristic probability**: With 'probability' 1/log(P) that P + p is prime, and ~P primes to try, failure probability is exp(-n^(cn)) - vanishingly small.",
      "**Polynomial bound**: Erdős's stronger conjecture says the smallest valid prime is polynomial in n, not just that one exists.",
      "**Computational verification**: Deaconescu checked n ≤ 1000, providing strong numerical evidence."
