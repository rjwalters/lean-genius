    "historicalContext": "**Tarski's Circle-Squaring Problem (1925)**\n\nOne of the most famous problems in geometric measure theory. Tarski asked whether a circle and square of equal area can be decomposed into finitely many congruent pieces.\n\n**Erdős's Comment:** 'A very beautiful problem...if it were my problem I would offer $1000 for it.'\n\n**Solution:** Laczkovich (1990) proved YES, and surprisingly, translations alone suffice!",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nCan a circle and square of equal area be decomposed into a finite number of congruent parts?\n\n**Answer: YES** (Laczkovich 1990)\n\n- Translations alone suffice (stronger than asked)\n- Uses approximately 10^50 pieces\n- Proof is non-constructive (uses Axiom of Choice)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Basic Shapes:** Define disk and square in R².\n2. **Equidecomposability:** Define translation congruence and decompositions.\n3. **Tarski's Problem:** Formalize the original question.\n4. **Laczkovich's Theorem:** Axiomatize the solution.\n5. **Key Features:** Note non-constructive nature and piece count.",
    "keyInsights": ["**65 years open:** From 1925 to 1990", "**Translations suffice:** Stronger than required", "**10^50 pieces:** Astronomical number", "**Non-constructive:** Requires Axiom of Choice", "**Non-measurable:** Pieces cannot all be Lebesgue measurable"]
