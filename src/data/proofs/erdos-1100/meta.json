(2) Is τ⊥(n) < exp((log n)^o(1)) for all n? (3) For squarefree n with ω(n) = k, what is g(k) = max τ⊥(n)?",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Hall in their 1978 paper 'On some unconventional problems on the divisors of integers'. It explores the structure of divisor sequences by counting how often consecutive divisors are coprime. The function τ⊥(n) captures a subtle arithmetic property: how the prime factorization of n constrains the 'gaps' between consecutive divisors.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 = d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_τ(n) = n be the divisors of n in increasing order. Define τ⊥(n) to count the number of indices i for which gcd(dᵢ, dᵢ₊₁) = 1.\n\n**Question 1 (OPEN):** Is it true that τ⊥(n)/ω(n) → ∞ for almost all n?\n\n**Question 2 (OPEN):** Is it true that τ⊥(n) < exp((log n)^o(1)) for all n?\n\n**Question 3:** For squarefree n with ω(n) = k prime factors, determine the growth of g(k) = max τ⊥(n).\n\n**Known results:**\n- τ⊥(n) ≥ ω(n) trivially (equality for infinitely many n)\n- Erdős-Hall: max_{n<x} τ⊥(n) > exp((log log x)^(2-ε))\n- Erdős-Simonovits: (√2 + o(1))^k < g(k) < (2-c)^k for some c > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the definitions of τ⊥(n) and g(k), axiomatize the known bounds from Erdős-Hall and Erdős-Simonovits, and state the three open questions precisely. The exponential bounds on g(k) are captured in a theorem showing the growth rate lies between √2 and 2-c.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Consecutive divisors dᵢ and dᵢ₊₁ differ by multiplying or dividing by prime powers",
      "Coprimality of consecutive divisors creates intricate combinatorial constraints",
      "The bounds on g(k) show structure is neither trivial nor chaotic",
      "Questions 1 and 2 remain open despite decades of study"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1100 poses three questions about τ⊥(n), the count of coprime consecutive divisor pairs. While the trivial lower bound τ⊥(n) ≥ ω(n) is established, and partial exponential bounds on g(k) are known from Erdős-Simonovits, the main questions about growth rates remain open.",
    "implications": "Understanding τ⊥(n) would illuminate the fine structure of divisor lattices and how prime factorizations constrain the ordering of divisors.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does τ⊥(n)/ω(n) → ∞ for almost all n?",
