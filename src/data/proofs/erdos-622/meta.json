  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #622: Cycle-Spanning Subsets**\n\nThis problem was posed jointly by Erdős and Faudree, asking about the prevalence of cycle-spanning subsets in dense regular graphs. The question connects cycle theory with subset enumeration.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1970s-1990s:** Erdős and Faudree posed the problem [Er99]\n- **Erdős's Observation:** 'Easy to see' that ≥ (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} sets are NOT on a cycle\n- **Counterexamples:** Minimum degree alone is insufficient (K_{n,n} with stars)\n- **2025:** Draganić-Keevash-Müyesser proved the affirmative answer\n- **Tightness:** The bound (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} is asymptotically tight",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet G be a regular graph with 2n vertices and degree n+1. Must G have ≫ 2^{2n} subsets that are spanned by a cycle?\n\n**Solution (Draganić-Keevash-Müyesser 2025):**\nYES! At least (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} subsets are spanned by cycles. Combined with Erdős's observation that (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} sets are NOT on cycles, this shows a remarkable half-half symmetry.\n\n**Key Condition:** Regularity is essential. Minimum degree n+1 alone is insufficient (K_{n,n} with stars is a counterexample).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Setup:** Define d-regular graphs and the Erdős-Faudree condition.\n\n2. **Cycle Definitions:** Formalize cycles as closed vertex-disjoint walks.\n\n3. **Cycle-Spanned Subsets:** Define when a subset is exactly the vertex set of some cycle.\n\n4. **Counting Function:** Define cycleSpannedCount as the number of such subsets.\n\n5. **Main Theorem (DKM 2025):** Axiomatize the asymptotic lower bound.\n\n6. **Tightness:** Show the bound cannot be improved.\n\n7. **Erdős Observation:** Formalize the complementary bound.\n\n8. **Counterexamples:** Show regularity is essential via K_{n,n} constructions.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #622 asks whether regular graphs with 2n vertices and degree n+1 must have many (≫ 2^{2n}) cycle-spanning subsets. Draganić-Keevash-Müyesser (2025) proved YES: at least (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} such subsets exist, matching Erdős's observation that the same proportion are NOT on cycles.",
    "implications": "**Implications**\n\n1. **Half-Half Phenomenon:** A remarkable symmetry—cycle and non-cycle subsets split the powerset roughly in half.\n\n2. **Regularity Matters:** The structural constraint of regularity is crucial; minimum degree alone is insufficient.\n\n3. **Extremal Graph Theory:** Connects degree conditions to cycle enumeration problems.\n\n4. **Probabilistic Interpretation:** Random regular graphs typically exhibit this behavior.",
