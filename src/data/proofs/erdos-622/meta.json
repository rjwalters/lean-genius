  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Faudree asked whether regular graphs with 2n vertices and degree n+1 must have many cycle-spanned subsets. Erdős observed it's 'easy to see' that at least (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} subsets are NOT on a cycle. Draganić-Keevash-Müyesser (2025) proved the same bound for subsets that ARE on a cycle.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a regular graph with 2n vertices and degree n+1. Must G have ≫ 2^{2n} subsets that are spanned by a cycle?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the Erdős-Faudree condition (2n vertices, degree n+1), cycle-spanned subsets, the main theorem (DKM 2025), tightness of the bound, Erdős's observation about non-cycle sets, counterexamples showing regularity is essential (K_{n,n}), Paley graph examples, and Hamiltonian cycles.",

      "This bound is asymptotically tight",
      "Both cycle and non-cycle sets are about half of all subsets",
      "Regularity is essential: K_{n,n} has only O(n!²) cycle-spanned sets",
      "Minimum degree condition alone is insufficient"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #622 on cycle-spanning subsets in regular graphs. Draganić-Keevash-Müyesser (2025) proved that at least (1/2 + o(1))2^{2n} subsets are spanned by a cycle, matching Erdős's observation that the same proportion are NOT on a cycle.",
    "implications": "The result shows a surprising symmetry: both cycle and non-cycle sets comprise about half of all subsets. The regularity condition is essential—minimum degree n+1 alone (as in K_{n,n} with stars) is insufficient.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact coefficient for the o(1) term?",
      "Can the bound be improved for specific graph families?",
      "What about longer cycles (≥ k vertices) for fixed k?"
