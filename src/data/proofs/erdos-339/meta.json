Must the set of integers representable as the sum of exactly $r$ distinct elements from $A$ have positive lower density?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham also ask whether if the set of integers which are the sum of $r$ elements from $A$ has positive upper density then must the set of integers representable as the sum of exactly $r$ distinct elements have positive upper density?\n\nThe answer to both questions is yes, as proved by Hegyv\\'{a}ri, Hennecart, and Plagne \\cite{HHP03}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[HHP03] Hegyv\\'ari, N. and Hennecart, F. and Plagne, A., A proof of two {E}rd\\H{o}s' conjectures on restricted addition\nand further results.
