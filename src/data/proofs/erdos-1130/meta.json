  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about Lagrange interpolation in 1947. The Lebesgue function Λ(x) = Σ|l_k(x)| measures how much interpolation amplifies errors. Erdős asked whether the functional Υ, the minimum over subintervals of the max Lebesgue function, grows at most logarithmically.",
    "problemStatement": "For points x₁,...,xₙ ∈ [-1,1], is Υ(x₁,...,xₙ) = min_i max_{x∈[xᵢ,xᵢ₊₁]} Σ|l_k(x)| at most O(log n)?",
    "proofStrategy": "Defines Lagrange basis polynomials, the Lebesgue function, and the Υ functional. States Erdős's initial √n bound, the optimal (2/π)log n + O(1) bound, and the de Boor–Pinkus characterization of maximizing nodes.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Lebesgue function measures the worst-case amplification of interpolation errors",
      "Erdős first proved Υ < √n, far from the conjectured log n",
      "The sharp bound (2/π) log n + O(1) matches the classical Lebesgue constant up to the Υ minimization",
      "De Boor–Pinkus showed optimal nodes equalize the Lebesgue function across subintervals"
