    "problemStatement": "**The Three Sylow Theorems** for a group G of order n = p^k * m where p is prime and p does not divide m:\n\n1. **Existence**: G has a subgroup of order p^k (Sylow p-subgroup)\n2. **Conjugacy**: All Sylow p-subgroups are conjugate to each other\n3. **Counting**: The number n_p of Sylow p-subgroups satisfies: n_p divides m and n_p ≡ 1 (mod p)\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #72.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Sylow I (Existence)**:\nUse induction on |G| and analyze the class equation.\n\n**Sylow II (Conjugacy)**:\nLet P act on cosets G/Q by multiplication and use orbit-stabilizer.\n\n**Sylow III (Counting)**:\nP acts on the set of Sylow p-subgroups by conjugation; the only fixed point is P itself.",
