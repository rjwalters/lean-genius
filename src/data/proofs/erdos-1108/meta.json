Does it contain only finitely many powerful numbers?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s at Oberwolfach in 1988. It is open even whether there are infinitely many squares of the form $1+n!$ (see [398]).\n\nThis was motivated in part by a problem of Mahler which he discussed with Erd\\H{o}s a few days before his death in 1988: if $k\\geq 5$ and\\[A_k= \\left\\{ \\sum_{n\\in S}k^n : S\\subset \\mathbb{N}\\textrm{ finite}\\right\\}\\]then does $A_k$ contain only finitely many squares? Mahler showed that there are infinitely many squares in $A_k$ for $k\\leq 4$, and found only one square for $k\\geq 5$, namely\\[1+7+7^2+7^3=400.\\]Brindza and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{BrEr91} proved that, for any $r$, if $n_1!+\\cdots+n_r!$ is powerful then $n_1\\ll_r 1$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BrEr91] Brindza, B. and Erd\\H{o}s, P., On some {D}iophantine problems involving powers and\nfactorials.
