  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Prime Number Theorem was conjectured by Legendre (1798) and Gauss (1849), then proved independently by Hadamard and de la Vallee Poussin in 1896. It describes how primes become less frequent as numbers grow, with approximately x/ln(x) primes up to x.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem**: The prime counting function pi(x) satisfies:\n\n$$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\pi(x)}{x/\\ln x} = 1$$\n\nEquivalently, pi(x) ~ x/ln(x), meaning the ratio approaches 1 as x approaches infinity.",
    "proofStrategy": "The modern proof uses complex analysis and the Riemann zeta function. Key steps include establishing a zero-free region for zeta(s) on the line Re(s) = 1, then applying Tauberian theorems to convert this analytic information into the asymptotic formula for pi(x).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The distribution of primes is governed by the Riemann zeta function",
      "Li(x) = integral from 2 to x of dt/ln(t) is a better approximation than x/ln(x)",
      "The Riemann Hypothesis would give the optimal error term O(sqrt(x) log(x))",
      "Chebyshev's bounds (1852) showed the limit, if it exists, must be 1"
