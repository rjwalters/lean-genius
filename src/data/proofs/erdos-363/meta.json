The condition $\\lvert I_i\\rvert \\geq 4$ is necessary here, since Pomerance has observed that the product of\\[(2^{n-1}-1)2^{n-1}(2^{n-1}+1),\\]\\[(2^n-1)2^n(2^n+1),\\]\\[(2^{2n-1}-2)(2^{2n-1}-1)2^{2n-1},\\]and\\[(2^{2n}-2)(2^{2n}-1)2^{2n}\\]is always a square.\n\nThis is false: Ulas \\cite{Ul05} has proved there are infinitely many solutions when $n=4$ or $n\\geq 6$ and $\\lvert I_i\\rvert=4$ for $1\\leq i\\leq n$. Bauer and Bennett \\cite{BaBe07} proved there are infinitely many solutions when $n=3$ or $n=5$ and $\\lvert I_i\\rvert=4$ for $1\\leq i\\leq n$. Furthermore, Bennett and Van Luijk \\cite{BeVL12} have found infinitely many solutions when $n\\geq 5$ and $\\lvert I_i\\rvert=5$ for $1\\leq i\\leq n$.\n\nIn general, Ulas conjectures there are infinitely many solutions for any fixed size of $\\lvert I_i\\rvert$, provided $n$ is sufficiently large.\n\nSee also [930] for a more general question.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaBe07] Bauer, Mark and Bennett, Michael A., On a question of Erd\\H{o}s and Graham.
