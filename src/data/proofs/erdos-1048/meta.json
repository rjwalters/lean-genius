  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1048 was DISPROVED by Pommerenke (1961). The Erdős-Herzog-Piranian conjecture (1958) asked whether L(f,1) must have a component with diameter > 2-r for monic f with roots in |z| ≤ r < 2. Pommerenke showed this is false for r > 1 using the counterexample f(z) = z^n - r^n. For r ≤ 1, modified positive results exist with the golden ratio as a critical threshold.",
    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance**\n\n1. **Complex Analysis**: Shows lemniscate structure depends critically on root distribution\n\n2. **Polynomial Theory**: Degree controls component count but not diameter\n\n3. **Potential Theory**: Logarithmic capacity provides geometric bounds\n\n4. **Critical Thresholds**: Golden ratio (√5-1)/2 ≈ 0.618 emerges naturally",
