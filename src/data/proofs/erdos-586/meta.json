The answer is no, as proved by Balister, Bollob\\'{a}s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \\cite{BBMST22}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BBMST22] Balister, Paul and Bollob\\'{a}s, B\\'{e}la and Morris, Robert\nand Sahasrabudhe, Julian and Tiba, Marius, On the Erd\\H{o}s covering problem: the density of the uncovered set.
