  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #342 concerns the Ulam sequence U(1,2), introduced by Stanislaw Ulam in 1964. The sequence begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 26, 28, ... where each subsequent term is the smallest integer with a unique representation as a sum of two distinct earlier terms. The problem asks whether infinitely many 'twin pairs' (a, a+2) occur. From [ErGr80, p.53]. OEIS A002858.",
    "problemStatement": "Define a sequence where a₁ = 1, a₂ = 2, and for n ≥ 2, a_{n+1} is the least integer greater than aₙ that can be expressed uniquely as aᵢ + aⱼ with i < j ≤ n. Do infinitely many twin pairs (a, a+2) occur in this sequence? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the Ulam sequence (noncomputable, with initial values axiomatized), the unique representation property, twin pairs, and the conjecture as Set.Infinite of twin indices. Growth rate and density questions are also formalized. The equivalence theorem erdos_342_statement is proved by simp.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Each term is the smallest integer with exactly one representation as a sum of two distinct earlier terms",
      "5 is excluded because 5 = 1+4 = 2+3 has two representations",
      "The growth rate is approximately a(n) ≈ 13.5n (empirical, Steinerberger 2015)",
      "Twin pairs like (26,28) and (478,480) appear but their infinitude is unknown",
      "The density of the Ulam sequence is also an open question"
