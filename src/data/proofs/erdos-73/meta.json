    "historicalContext": "**The 'Mangoes and Blueberries' Theorem**\n\nThis problem characterizes graphs that are 'almost bipartite' through the lens of independent sets. The colorful name comes from Reed's 1999 paper in Combinatorica, which solved this and related problems.\n\n**The Bipartite Connection**: Bipartite graphs have the property that every subgraph on n vertices has an independent set of size at least n/2 (just take one side of the bipartition). Erdős asked: if we allow this bound to be off by k/2, does this force the graph to be bipartite plus a bounded number of 'exceptional' vertices?\n\n**The Trivial Case**: When k=0, the answer is immediate. If G isn't bipartite, it contains an odd cycle. An odd cycle on 2m+1 vertices has independence number m, which is less than (2m+1)/2. So any non-bipartite graph fails the k=0 condition.\n\n**Reed's Contribution**: The general case k ≥ 1 required sophisticated structural analysis, showing that graphs satisfying the condition decompose into a bipartite 'core' plus O_k(1) vertices.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet k ≥ 0. Let G be a graph such that every subgraph H on n vertices contains an independent set of size ≥ (n-k)/2. Must G be the union of a bipartite graph and O_k(1) many vertices?\n\n**Notation**: O_k(1) means a constant depending only on k, not on the size of G.\n\n**Intuition**: The condition says every subgraph is 'close to bipartite' in terms of independence number. The question asks if this local property forces a global structure.\n\n**Answer**: YES. Reed proved that such graphs can be decomposed into a bipartite graph plus at most f(k) additional vertices for some function f.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach (Reed 1999)**\n\nReed's proof in 'Mangoes and Blueberries' uses structural graph theory techniques:\n\n1. **Extremal Analysis**: Consider a minimal counterexample - a graph G satisfying the independence condition but requiring many non-bipartite vertices.\n\n2. **Odd Cycle Structure**: Analyze how odd cycles can coexist in G. The independence condition severely restricts their interaction.\n\n3. **Vertex Removal**: Show that removing a bounded number of vertices eliminates all odd cycles, leaving a bipartite graph.\n\n4. **Bounding the Exception Set**: Prove the bound on exceptional vertices depends only on k, not on |V(G)|.\n\n**Key Technique**: The proof leverages the fact that odd cycles of different lengths that share vertices create subgraphs with small independence number, which the condition forbids.",
