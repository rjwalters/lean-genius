Let $G$ be a graph such that every subgraph $H$ contains an independent set of size $\\geq (n-k)/2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $H$. Must $G$ be the union of a bipartite graph and $O_k(1)$ many vertices?\n\n\n\nProved by Reed \\cite{Re99}. (Thanks also to Reed for pointing out that the case $k=0$ is trivial, since if $G$ is not bipartite then $G$ contains an odd cycle.)\n\nSee also [922] and the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Re99] Reed, B., Mangoes and Blueberries.
