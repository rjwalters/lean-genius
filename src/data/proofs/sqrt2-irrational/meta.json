  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The discovery that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational is attributed to the ancient Greeks, possibly Hippasus of Metapontum around 500 BCE. The Pythagoreans had built their philosophy on the belief that all quantities could be expressed as ratios of whole numbers—\"all is number.\" The discovery that the diagonal of a unit square (which has length $\\sqrt{2}$ by the Pythagorean theorem) cannot be so expressed shattered this worldview.\n\nAccording to legend, Hippasus was drowned at sea for revealing this disturbing truth. Whether or not the legend is true, the mathematical crisis was real: it forced Greek mathematicians to distinguish between number (arithmetic) and magnitude (geometry), a distinction that would persist for two millennia until the rigorous construction of the real numbers in the 19th century.\n\nThis proof represents one of the earliest examples of proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum) in mathematics, and remains a cornerstone of mathematical education to this day.",
    "problemStatement": "The diagonal of a unit square has length $\\sqrt{2}$. The question is: can this length be expressed as a ratio of integers?\n\n$$\\text{Does there exist } \\frac{p}{q} = \\sqrt{2} \\text{ with } p, q \\in \\mathbb{Z}, q \\neq 0?$$\n\nEquivalently, squaring both sides: does there exist a solution to $p^2 = 2q^2$ in integers? The answer is no—$\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof proceeds by contradiction:\n\n1. Assume $\\sqrt{2} = p/q$ where $p, q$ are integers in lowest terms (no common factors)\n2. Square both sides: $p^2 = 2q^2$\n3. Parity argument: $p^2$ is even, so $p$ must be even (key lemma!)\n4. Substitute: Write $p = 2k$, then $4k^2 = 2q^2$, so $q^2 = 2k^2$\n5. Repeat: $q^2$ is even, so $q$ is even\n6. Contradiction: Both $p$ and $q$ are even, so they share factor 2—but we assumed lowest terms!",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The geometric origin: $\\sqrt{2}$ is the diagonal of a unit square, arising naturally from the Pythagorean theorem $1^2 + 1^2 = (\\sqrt{2})^2$.",
      "The parity lemma is the engine: if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even. This follows because odd$^2$ = odd.",
      "Infinite descent: the argument implicitly shows that if $(p, q)$ is a solution, so is $(q, p/2)$—a smaller solution. This can't continue forever.",
      "**Generalization**: The proof works because 2 appears to *odd multiplicity* (exactly once). For any $n$ where some prime $p$ appears to odd multiplicity, $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational.",
      "Perfect squares ($1, 4, 9, 16, ...$) have all primes appearing to even multiplicity—that's why their square roots are rational."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization demonstrates the power of proof by contradiction—a technique invented by the ancient Greeks and still central to mathematics today. The Lean proof closely mirrors the classical argument: assume rationality, derive that both numerator and denominator must be even, contradict the assumption of lowest terms.\n\nThe generalization reveals the deeper principle: the argument works because primes in non-squares appear to *odd multiplicity*. Whether it's $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{5}$, $\\sqrt{6}$, or $\\sqrt{7}$—the same underlying theorem applies.",
    "implications": "Historical Impact\n\nThe irrationality of $\\sqrt{2}$ triggered the first foundational crisis in mathematics. The Pythagorean belief that \"all is number\" (meaning ratios of integers) was shattered. Greek mathematics responded by developing the theory of proportions (Eudoxus) and separating arithmetic from geometry—a split that lasted until the 19th century.\n\nMathematical Consequences\n\n1. Incommensurable magnitudes exist — The diagonal of a unit square cannot share a common measure with its sides. There is no length, however small, that divides both evenly.\n\n2. The rationals have gaps — Between any two rationals lie infinitely many irrationals. The rational number line is \"full of holes.\"\n\n3. Necessity of real numbers — To do calculus, we need limits. Limits require completeness. The rationals aren't complete; the reals are. This proof shows why we can't stop at $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n4. The General Pattern — $\\sqrt{n}$ is irrational exactly when $n$ is not a perfect square. This is because non-squares have some prime appearing to odd multiplicity.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What about $\\sqrt[3]{2}$? Parity arguments don't work here. This requires algebraic number theory and the rational root theorem. (The multiplicity argument generalizes: if some prime has multiplicity not divisible by 3, the cube root is irrational.)",
      "Are there irrational numbers that aren't roots of any polynomial? Yes—transcendental numbers like $\\pi$ and $e$. Proving their irrationality is much harder.",
      "Can this generalize to $\\sqrt[n]{m}$? Yes! $\\sqrt[n]{m}$ is irrational iff $m$ is not a perfect $n$-th power."
