  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1975 about Ramsey-type results for circumradii. His 1978 claimed bound contained errors. Martinez and Roldán-Pensado corrected the proof and showed n_k ≪ k⁹.",
    "problemStatement": "For k ≥ 3, what is the minimal n_k such that any n_k points in general position in ℝ² contain a k-subset where all C(k,3) triples have distinct circumradii?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define general position, circumradius, and the distinct circumradii property computationally. The function n_k is axiomatized with validity and sharpness properties. The Martinez-Roldán-Pensado polynomial bound is stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "General position (no three collinear) ensures all circumradii are well-defined",
      "The circumradius formula R² = |pq|²|qr|²|rp|² / (16·Area²) is used",
      "Erdős's original bound was incorrect; the corrected bound is n_k ≪ k⁹",
      "n_3 = 3 trivially since one triangle has one circumradius"
