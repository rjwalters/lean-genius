  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Egyptian fractions—sums of distinct unit fractions—date back to ancient Egypt (Rhind Papyrus, c. 1650 BCE). This problem asks how large denominators must be to represent any rational a/b. Bleicher and Erdős (1976) initiated the modern study, proving D(b) ≪ b(log b)². The question was whether the (log b)² can be reduced to (log b)^{1+o(1)}.",
    "problemStatement": "For integers 1 ≤ a < b, let D(a,b) be the minimal maximum denominator in any Egyptian fraction representation of a/b. Define D(b) = max_{1 ≤ a < b} D(a,b). Is it true that D(b) ≪ b(log b)^{1+o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "Yokota (1988) proved D(b) ≪ b(log b)(log log b)⁴(log log log b)² using refined analysis of the greedy algorithm and number-theoretic techniques. Liu-Sawhney (2024) improved this to (log log b)³(log log log b)^{O(1)} using connections to additive combinatorics.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The greedy (Fibonacci-Sylvester) algorithm gives existence but not optimal denominators",
      "Lower bound D(p) ≫ p log p for primes shows (log b)¹ factor is necessary",
      "The iterated logarithm factors (log log b)^k are (log b)^{o(1)}",
      "Harmonic sums H_n ~ log n explain why logarithms appear",
      "The problem connects to dense subsets summing to 1"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #305 was solved by Yokota (1988) who proved D(b) ≪ b(log b)(log log b)⁴(log log log b)², confirming D(b) ≪ b(log b)^{1+o(1)}. Liu-Sawhney (2024) improved the bound to (log log b)³(log log log b)^{O(1)}.",
    "implications": "The result shows that Egyptian fraction representations require denominators only slightly larger than b log b. This connects number theory to algorithmic questions about fraction representation and has implications for additive combinatorics.",
