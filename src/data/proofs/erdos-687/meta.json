  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős offered $1,000 for determining the growth rate of Y(x), the maximum interval covered by residue classes of primes ≤ x. This is equivalent to the Jacobsthal function of the primorial. Iwaniec (1978) proved Y(x) ≪ x². Ford, Green, Konyagin, Maynard, and Tao (2018) gave the best lower bound using their breakthrough on large prime gaps.",
    "problemStatement": "Is Y(x) = o(x²)? Is Y(x) ≪ x^{1+o(1)}? What is the true growth rate?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize covering systems, the Jacobsthal function, Y(x) as the Jacobsthal function of the primorial, the $1,000 conjecture, and known upper/lower bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Y(x) equals the Jacobsthal function g(primorial(x))",
      "Iwaniec: Y(x) ≪ x² — best known upper bound since 1978",
