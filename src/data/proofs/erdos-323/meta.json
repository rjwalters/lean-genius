    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham asked about the counting function f_{k,m}(x) of integers representable as sums of m nonneg k-th powers. Landau resolved k = 2: f_{2,2}(x) ~ c·x/√(log x). For k > 2, even whether f_{k,k}(x) = o(x) is unknown. Erdős called the problem 'unattackable by the methods at our disposal.'",
    "problemStatement": "Is f_{k,k}(x) ≫_ε x^{1-ε}? For m < k, is f_{k,m}(x) ≫ x^{m/k}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sums of k-th powers and the counting function f_{k,m}(x). Landau's asymptotic for sums of two squares is axiomatised. Both conjectures and the density question are stated.",

      "For k > 2, it is unknown whether f_{k,k}(x) has positive density",
