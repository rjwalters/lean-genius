  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős, Eggleton, and Selfridge. It connects to deep questions about prime distribution, sieve theory, and Siegel zeros. Terry Tao discussed it in a 2024 blog post.",
    "problemStatement": "Let F(n) = max{m + p(m) : m < n, m composite}, where p(m) is the least prime divisor of m. Question 1: Is F(n) > n for all large n? Question 2: Does F(n) - n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines composite numbers, least prime divisor, and the function F(n). It states both questions as conjectures, provides upper/lower bounds, and connects to related problems.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "F(n) ≤ n + √n (trivial upper bound since p(m) ≤ √m for composite m)",
      "Conjectured: F(n) ≥ n + (1 - o(1))√n",
      "Equivalent to Problem #430 for large n (Sarosh Adenwalla)",
      "Connected to prime gaps and the parity problem in sieve theory"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #385 asks two questions about F(n), the maximum of m + p(m) over composites. Both remain open, though plausible prime conjectures would imply F(n) > n for large n.",
    "implications": "A positive answer would reveal structure in how composites with small prime factors are distributed. The connection to Siegel zeros makes this particularly deep.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Are there infinitely many n with F(n) ≤ n?",
