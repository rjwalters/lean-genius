    "historicalContext": "Erdős observed in a 1979 letter that 3·4 ≡ 5·6·7 ≡ 1 (mod 11), producing two consecutive intervals with products congruent to 1. Makowski (1983) extended this to three intervals modulo 17. The problem asks whether this extends to arbitrarily many intervals. It appears as Problem A15 in Guy's Unsolved Problems in Number Theory.",
    "problemStatement": "For every k ≥ 2, does there exist a prime p and k consecutive intervals I₁, ..., Iₖ (partitioning a range of integers) such that the product of integers in each interval is ≡ 1 (mod p)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize interval products, define solutions as prime-boundary pairs satisfying the congruence, verify the known k=2 and k=3 examples via native_decide, state the main conjecture, and connect to Wilson's theorem and the Noll–Simmons factorial generalization.",
