The classic finite geometry construction shows that $t=n$ is possible. A theorem of Erd\\H{o}s and de Bruijn \\cite{dBEr48} states that $t\\geq n$.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Erd\\H{o}s, Fowler, S\\'{o}s, and Wilson \\cite{EFSW85}, who further show that unless the block design is obtained from a projective plane by 'breaking up' one of its lines then $t\\geq n+cp$ where $c\\approx 1.148$.\n\nIn general, one can ask what the possible values of $t$ are, for a given $n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EFSW85] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Fowler, Joel C. and S\\'os, Vera T. and\nWilson, Richard M., On {$2$}-designs.
