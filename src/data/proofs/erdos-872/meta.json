One player wants the game to last as long as possible, the other wants the game to end quickly. How long can the game be guaranteed to last for?\n\nAt least $\\epsilon n$ moves? (For $\\epsilon>0$ and $n$ sufficiently large.) At least $(1-\\epsilon)\\frac{n}{2}$ moves?\n\n\n\nA number theoretic variant of a combinatorial game of Hajnal, in which players alternately add edges to a graph while keeping it triangle-free. This game must trivially end in at most $n^2/4$ moves, and F\\\"{u}redi and Seress \\cite{FuSe91} proved that it can be guaranteed to last for $\\gg n\\log n$ moves. Bir\\'{o}, Horn, and Wildstrom \\cite{BPW16} proved that it must end in at most $(\\frac{26}{121}+o(1))n^2$ moves.\n\nThis type of game is known as a saturation game.\n\nErd\\H{o}s does not specify which player goes first, which may result in different answers.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BPW16] Bir\\'{o}, Csaba and Horn, Paul and Wildstrom, D.
