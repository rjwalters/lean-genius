  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus (1975) noted that the least integer not dividing C(2n,n) is typically exp((log n)^{1/2+o(1)}). The problem asks for a precise function f(n) describing this behavior. Kummer's theorem connects divisibility to base-p digit structure.",
    "problemStatement": "Find a reasonable function f(n) such that for almost all n, the least m with m ∤ C(2n,n) satisfies m ~ f(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize central binomial coefficients, the least non-divisor function, Kummer's theorem on carries, the EGRS asymptotic, and bounds from Bertrand's postulate and the prime number theorem.",
