    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #883 studies cycle structure in the coprime graph on subsets of integers. Erdős-Sárkőzy (1997) proved odd cycles of length cn exist above the threshold. Sárkőzy (1999) solved Question 2 on tripartite subgraphs. The threshold floor(n/2) + floor(n/3) - floor(n/6) arises from inclusion-exclusion on multiples of 2 and 3.",
    "problemStatement": "For A subset of {1,...,n}, let G(A) be the coprime graph. Question 1 (Open): If |A| > floor(n/2) + floor(n/3) - floor(n/6), does G(A) contain all odd cycles of length at most n/3 + 1? Question 2 (Solved): Does the same threshold guarantee a complete (1,l,l) tripartite subgraph?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the coprime graph using SimpleGraph, the threshold via inclusion-exclusion, and the extremal set (multiples of 2 or 3). Erdős-Sárkőzy (odd cycles for cn) and Sárkőzy (tripartite subgraphs) are axiomatized. Three proved theorems: erdos_883_question_2_solved, erdos_883_partial, and erdos_883.",
