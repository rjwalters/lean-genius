If $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ has $\\lvert A\\rvert=n$ and $G$ is any graph on $A$ with at least $n^{1+c}$ edges then\\[\\max(\\lvert A+_GA\\rvert,\\lvert A\\cdot_G A\\rvert) \\geq \\lvert A\\rvert^{1+c-\\epsilon},\\]where\\[A+_GA = \\{ a+b : (a,b)\\in G\\}\\]and similarly for $A\\cdot_GA$.\n\n\n\nA problem often attributed to Erd\\H{o}s and Szemer\\'{e}di, which strengthens the conjecture [52], although it appears in \\cite{Er77c} without attribution to Szemer\\'{e}di.\n\nThis strong conjecture was disproved by Alon, Ruzsa, and Solymosi \\cite{ARS20}, who constructed (for arbitrarily large $n$) a set of integers $A$ with $\\lvert A\\rvert=n$ and a graph $G$ with $\\gg n^{5/3-o(1)}$ many edges such that\\[\\max(\\lvert A+_GA\\rvert,\\lvert A\\cdot_G A\\rvert) \\ll \\lvert A\\rvert^{4/3+o(1)}.\\]Alon, Ruzsa, and Solymosi do prove, however, that if $A$ has size $n$ and $G$ has $m$ edges then\\[\\max(\\lvert A+_GA\\rvert,\\lvert A\\cdot_G A\\rvert) \\gg m^{3/2}n^{-7/4}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ARS20] Alon, Noga and Ruzsa, Imre and Solymosi, J\\'{o}zsef, Sums, products, and ratios along the edges of a graph.
