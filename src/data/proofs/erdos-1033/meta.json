Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, is it true that\\[h(n)\\geq (2(\\sqrt{3}-1)-o(1))n?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Laskar \\cite{ErLa85} proved\\[2(\\sqrt{3}-1)n \\geq h(n) \\geq (1+c)n\\]for some $c>0$. The lower bound was improved to $\\frac{21}{16}n$ by Fan \\cite{Fa88}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErLa85] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Laskar, Renu, A note on the size of a chordal subgraph. Congr. Numer.
