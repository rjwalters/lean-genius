  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Simonovits introduced the density jump concept in 1974, generalizing the Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem from graphs to hypergraphs. For ordinary graphs, the complete characterization A_2 = {1−1/m} is a cornerstone of extremal graph theory. The hypergraph case remains one of the central open problems.",
    "problemStatement": "For k-uniform hypergraphs, let A_k be the set of α ∈ [0,1] such that there exists β > α where density > α in a sequence forces subgraphs of density > β. The graph case is solved: A_2 = {1−1/m}. What is A_3?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define density jumps for k-uniform hypergraphs, record the classical graph result A_2 = {1−1/m}, and state the main question about A_3. We note connections to the hypergraph Turán problem and flag algebra methods.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A_2 = {1−1/m : m ≥ 1} by Erdős–Stone–Simonovits theorem",
      "Each jump in A_2 corresponds to a Turán density π(K_{m+1})",
      "Even the simplest hypergraph Turán density π(K_4^{(3)}) is unknown",
      "Flag algebra methods (Razborov) can compute some jump values",
      "The structure of A_3 is likely much more complex than A_2"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #837 asks for the density jump set A_3 of 3-uniform hypergraphs. While A_2 has an elegant characterization via Turán densities, the hypergraph case is entangled with the unsolved hypergraph Turán problem, making A_3 one of the hardest open problems in extremal combinatorics.",
    "implications": "Characterizing A_3 would represent a major breakthrough in hypergraph extremal theory, with connections to the Turán tetrahedron conjecture, flag algebras, and the structure of dense hypergraphs.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is A_3 for 3-uniform hypergraphs?",
      "Is the set A_3 countable or uncountable?",
      "Does A_3 have the same structure as A_2 (isolated points)?",
