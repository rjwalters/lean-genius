  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Eggleton, and Selfridge posed this problem about the distribution of least prime factors in shifted integers. The question asks whether near any large integer, one can always find a composite number whose smallest prime factor is surprisingly large relative to the shift.",
    "problemStatement": "For all sufficiently large n, does there exist k > 0 such that n+k is composite and p(n+k) > k², where p(m) denotes the least prime factor of m?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the least prime factor via Nat.minFac, IsLeastPrimeFactor as a predicate, and states the conjecture existentially. The generalisation to k^d for arbitrary d is also captured.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The conjecture requires n+k to be composite (primes trivially have large LPF)",
      "The least prime factor of a composite m satisfies p(m) ≤ √m",
      "The generalisation asks for p(n+k) > k^d for any fixed d",
      "The original conjecture is the d=2 case"
