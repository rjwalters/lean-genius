  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered this formula around 1676, though it was independently found by James Gregory in 1671. Remarkably, Madhava of Sangamagrama may have discovered this series in India around 1400 CE, nearly 300 years before European mathematicians. The series converges very slowly, but its elegance has made it a favorite of mathematicians for centuries.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Wiedijk #26)**: The Leibniz formula for pi:\n\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{4} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{9} - \\cdots$$\n\nIn summation notation:\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{2n + 1}$$",
    "proofStrategy": "The Leibniz series arises from the Taylor series of arctan(x):\n\narctan(x) = x - x^3/3 + x^5/5 - x^7/7 + ...\n\nEvaluating at x = 1 gives the Leibniz series. Since arctan(1) = pi/4 (at x = 1, we're at a 45 degree angle where tan(theta) = 1), this gives the result.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The series is the Taylor expansion of arctan(x) at x = 1",
      "This is a conditionally convergent series - absolute values diverge",
      "Converges slowly: need ~1 million terms for 6 decimal places",
      "Demonstrates that pi can be expressed through rational operations and limits",
      "Even-indexed terms (from 0) are positive, odd-indexed terms are negative"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The Leibniz series is one of the most famous formulas in mathematics, demonstrating that pi can be expressed through the simple pattern of alternating fractions with odd denominators. Though it converges too slowly for practical computation, it reveals the deep connection between pi and the arctangent function.",
    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance:**\n\n**1. Historical importance**\nOne of the first infinite series for pi.\n\n**2. Connection to arctangent**\nShows the relationship between pi and inverse trigonometric functions.\n\n**3. Conditional convergence**\nA beautiful example where alternating signs create sufficient cancellation.\n\n**Faster Alternatives:**\n\n- Machin's formula (1706): pi/4 = 4*arctan(1/5) - arctan(1/239)\n- Chudnovsky algorithm: Converges at 14+ digits per term",
