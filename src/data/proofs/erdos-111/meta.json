Is it true that $h_G(n)/n\\to \\infty$ for every graph $G$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$?\n\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{EHS82}. Every $G$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ must have $h_G(n)\\gg n$ since $G$ must contain, for some $r$, $\\aleph_1$ many vertex disjoint odd cycles of length $2r+1$.\n\nOn the other hand, Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\\'{e}di proved that there is a $G$ with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ such that $h_G(n)\\ll n^{3/2}$. In \\cite{Er81} Erd\\H{o}s conjectured that this can be improved to $\\ll n^{1+\\epsilon}$ for every $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nSee also [74].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHS82] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A. and Szemer\\'{e}di, E., On almost bipartite large chromatic graphs.
