  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #111: Edge Deletion and Chromatic Number**\n\nThis problem explores the structure of graphs with uncountable chromatic number through the lens of bipartiteness. It was posed by Erdős, Hajnal, and Szemerédi in their 1982 paper \"On almost bipartite large chromatic graphs.\"\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős-Hajnal-Szemerédi (1982): Established that graphs with χ(G) = ℵ₁ satisfy h_G(n) ≫ n (they contain uncountably many vertex-disjoint odd cycles)\n- Erdős-Hajnal-Szemerédi (1982): Constructed a graph with χ = ℵ₁ where h_G(n) ≪ n^(3/2)\n- Erdős (1981): Conjectured this upper bound can be improved to n^(1+ε) for any ε > 0\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- h_G(n) measures how \"far from bipartite\" the densest n-vertex subgraphs of G are\n- The chromatic number ℵ₁ is the smallest uncountable cardinal\n- Such graphs cannot be properly colored with countably many colors\n\nThe problem lies at the intersection of graph theory, combinatorics, and set theory, involving infinite structures that cannot be resolved by finite computation.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nFor a graph G, let h_G(n) be the maximum number of edges that must be deleted from any n-vertex subgraph of G to make it bipartite.\n\n**Question:** Is it true that h_G(n)/n → ∞ for every graph G with chromatic number ℵ₁?\n\n**Answer: UNKNOWN**\n\n**Known Results:**\n- **Lower bound:** h_G(n) ≫ n for all graphs with χ(G) = ℵ₁\n- **Upper bound:** There exists G with χ(G) = ℵ₁ and h_G(n) = O(n^{3/2})\n- **Conjecture:** h_G(n) = O(n^{1+ε}) should be achievable for all ε > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define bipartiteness, edge deletion, and chromatic number using Mathlib's SimpleGraph\n\n2. **Cardinal Chromatic Number:** Extend to infinite graphs using Mathlib's Cardinal type\n\n3. **Key Function:** Define h_G(n) as the supremum of edges needed over all n-vertex subgraphs\n\n4. **Lower Bound:** Axiomatize the EHS result on vertex-disjoint odd cycles\n\n5. **Upper Bound:** Axiomatize the existence of the EHS construction\n\n6. **Open Question:** State the main problem without resolving it\n\n7. **Summary:** Combine known bounds into a summary theorem\n\nAxioms are needed because the results involve sophisticated infinite combinatorics beyond Mathlib's current scope.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #111 remains open. The question asks whether h_G(n)/n → ∞ for every graph G with chromatic number ℵ₁. We know h_G(n) ≫ n (from vertex-disjoint odd cycles) and that h_G(n) ≪ n^(3/2) is achievable (from the EHS construction). Erdős conjectured this can be improved to h_G(n) ≪ n^(1+ε) for all ε > 0. The problem cannot be resolved by finite computation and lies at the frontier of infinite combinatorics.",
