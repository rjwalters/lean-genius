    "historicalContext": "**Linear Hypergraphs**\n\nA hypergraph is linear if any two edges share at most one vertex. A 3-uniform linear hypergraph is also called a partial Steiner triple system.\n\n**Independent Sets**: A set of vertices is independent if it contains no complete edge.\n\n**Erdős's Original Bounds**: Erdős proved n^(1/2) ≪ f(n) ≪ n^(2/3), leaving a gap between the exponents 1/2 and 2/3.\n\n**Resolution**: Phelps and Rödl (1986) determined the exact asymptotic: f(n) ≍ (n log n)^(1/2). The log factor closes Erdős's gap.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet f(n) be such that every 3-uniform linear hypergraph on n vertices contains an independent set of size f(n). Estimate f(n).\n\n**Status**: SOLVED (Phelps-Rödl 1986)\n\n**Answer**: f(n) ≍ (n log n)^(1/2)\n\n**Note**: Erdős's original bounds were n^(1/2) ≪ f(n) ≪ n^(2/3).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach**\n\n1. **Lower Bound (Probabilistic)**: Include each vertex with probability p. Expected independent set size is pn - mp³ (where m = number of edges). Optimize p.\n\n2. **Upper Bound (Construction)**: Build linear hypergraphs with small independence numbers using algebraic or probabilistic constructions.\n\n3. **Key Insight**: The number of edges m in a 3-uniform linear hypergraph is at most n²/6 (Steiner bound). This gives (n log n)^(1/2).\n\n4. **The Log Factor**: Arises from careful analysis of edge distribution.",
