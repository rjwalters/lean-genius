  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Simonovits posed this conjecture in 1982, building on the classical theory of extremal numbers for even cycles. The Bondy–Simonovits theorem gives ex(n; C_{2k}) = O(n^{1+1/k}), and algebraic constructions match this for certain k. The conjecture asserts that additionally forbidding the odd cycle C_{2k−1} does not change the asymptotics.",
    "problemStatement": "For k ≥ 2, prove that ex(n; {C_{2k−1}, C_{2k}}) = (1+o(1))·(n/2)^{1+1/k}. This says the extremal number for forbidding both C_{2k−1} and C_{2k} is asymptotically the same as for C_{2k} alone.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define cycle containment and the extremal function for consecutive cycle pairs. We state the main conjecture, record the Bondy–Simonovits upper bound and even cycle Turán number, and note that algebraic constructions often avoid both cycles simultaneously.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "ex(n; C_{2k}) = Θ(n^{1+1/k}) by Bondy–Simonovits and algebraic constructions",
      "The conjecture says forbidding C_{2k−1} additionally is asymptotically free",
      "Algebraic constructions (projective planes) often avoid both C_{2k−1} and C_{2k}",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #574 conjectures that the Turán number for the pair {C_{2k−1}, C_{2k}} matches that of C_{2k} alone. This would show that odd cycle avoidance comes for free in this extremal setting, consistent with algebraic constructions that naturally avoid both cycle lengths.",
