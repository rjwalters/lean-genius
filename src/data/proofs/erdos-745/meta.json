    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #745: Random Graph Components**\n\nThis problem concerns the Erdős-Rényi random graph model G(n, p), one of the foundational models in probabilistic combinatorics.\n\n**Historical Timeline:**\n- 1959-1960: Erdős and Rényi introduce the random graph model G(n, p)\n- 1960: They discover the phase transition at p = 1/n\n- 1960s-70s: The structure of the giant component is studied\n- 1980: Komlós, Sulyok, and Szemerédi prove Erdős's conjecture about the second largest component\n- 1980s-90s: Łuczak and others refine understanding of the critical window\n\n**The Phase Transition:**\nAt p = 1/n, the random graph undergoes a dramatic change:\n- p < 1/n: All components small (size O(log n))\n- p = 1/n: Giant emerges with size Θ(n^{2/3})\n- p > 1/n: Unique giant of size Θ(n)",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nDescribe the size of the second largest component of the random graph $G(n, 1/n)$, where each edge is included independently with probability $1/n$.\n\n**Answer:**\nAlmost surely, the second largest component has size $\\Theta(\\log n)$.\n\nMore precisely:\n- Upper bound: second largest $\\leq c \\log n$ w.h.p.\n- Lower bound: second largest $\\geq c' \\log n$ w.h.p.\n\nThis was conjectured by Erdős and proved by Komlós, Sulyok, and Szemerédi in 1980.\n\n**The contrast is striking:**\n- Giant (largest): $\\Theta(n^{2/3})$\n- Second largest: $\\Theta(\\log n)$\n\nThe gap is polynomial!",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Random Graph Model:** Define G(n, p) structure with edge probability\n\n2. **Critical Threshold:** Define p = 1/n as the critical probability\n\n3. **Phase Transition:** Axiomatize subcritical, critical, and supercritical regimes\n\n4. **Giant Component:** Axiomatize that the giant has size Θ(n^{2/3})\n\n5. **KSS Theorem:** Axiomatize Komlós-Sulyok-Szemerédi result\n\n6. **Main Theorem:** Combine upper and lower bounds\n\n**Why Axioms?** Probability theory and concentration inequalities required for the proof are not fully developed in Mathlib.",

      "**Critical Threshold:** At p = 1/n, the random graph is 'on the edge' of containing a giant",
      "**Giant Size:** At criticality, giant has size Θ(n^{2/3}), not Θ(n) as in supercritical case",
      "**Winner Takes All:** The giant is polynomially larger than the second component",

      "**Critical Window:** Phase transition has width n^{-1/3} around p = 1/n",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #745 asked about the second largest component of G(n, 1/n). Erdős conjectured it is O(log n), which was proved by Komlós, Sulyok, and Szemerédi in 1980. The answer is Θ(log n) - dramatically smaller than the giant component of size Θ(n^{2/3}).",
    "implications": "**Impact on Random Graph Theory**\n\n1. **Phase Transitions:** Demonstrates the dramatic nature of the critical threshold\n\n2. **Winner Takes All:** At criticality, one component dominates all others\n\n3. **Scaling Exponents:** The exponents 2/3 (giant) and log (others) are universal\n\n4. **Percolation Theory:** Foundational for understanding mean-field critical phenomena\n\n5. **Algorithmic Applications:** Finding the giant component is a key subroutine",
