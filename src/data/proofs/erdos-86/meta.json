Is it true that every subgraph of $Q_n$ with\\[\\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\\right)n2^{n-1}\\]many edges contains a $C_4$?\n\n\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the maximum number of edges in a subgraph of $Q_n$ without a $C_4$, so that this conjecture is that $f(n)\\leq (\\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n2^{n-1}$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er91} showed that\\[f(n) \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{c}{n}\\right)n2^{n-1}\\]for some constant $c>0$, and wrote it is 'perhaps not hopeless' to determine $f(n)$ exactly. Brass, Harborth, and Nienborg \\cite{BHN95} improved this to\\[f(n) \\geq \\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)n2^{n-1}\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nBalogh, Hu, Lidicky, and Liu \\cite{BHLL14} proved that $f(n)\\leq 0.6068 n2^{n-1}$. This was improved to $\\leq 0.60318 n2^{n-1}$ by Baber \\cite{Ba12b}.\n\nA similar question can be asked for other even cycles.\n\nSee also [666] and the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BHLL14] Balogh, J\\'{o}zsef and Hu, Ping and Lidick\\'{y}, Bernard and Liu, Hong, Upper bounds on the size of 4- and 6-cycle-free subgraphs of the hypercube.
