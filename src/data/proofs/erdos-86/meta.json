  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The n-dimensional hypercube Qₙ is a fundamental structure in combinatorics with 2ⁿ vertices (binary strings) and n·2^(n-1) edges (between strings differing in one bit). Erdős asked in 1991: how dense can a C₄-free subgraph be? He conjectured the answer is (1/2 + o(1)) of all edges, meaning you can keep about half while avoiding 4-cycles.",
    "problemStatement": "Let Qₙ be the n-dimensional hypercube. Let f(n) be the maximum number of edges in a C₄-free subgraph of Qₙ. Is it true that f(n) ≤ (1/2 + o(1))·n·2^(n-1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "This problem remains OPEN. The best known upper bound is f(n) ≤ 0.60318·n·2^(n-1) (Baber 2012), while the lower bound shows f(n) > (1/2 + c/√n)·n·2^(n-1) (Brass-Harborth-Nienborg 1995). Closing the gap between 0.5 and 0.60318 would resolve the conjecture.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A C₄ in Qₙ forms a 'square' where two coordinates vary independently",
      "The trivial bound is f(n) ≤ n·2^(n-1) (all edges)",
      "The lower bound f(n) > (1/2)·n·2^(n-1) means more than half the edges can be kept",
      "The gap between 0.5 and 0.60318 is the heart of the open problem",
      "Flag algebra methods gave the best upper bound (Baber 2012)"
