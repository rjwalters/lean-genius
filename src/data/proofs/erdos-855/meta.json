In \\cite{Er85c} Erd\\H{o}s describes it as 'an old conjecture of mine which was probably already stated by Hardy and Littlewood'.\n\nThis is probably false, since Hensley and Richards \\cite{HeRi73} have shown that this is false assuming the Hardy-Littlewood prime tuples conjecture. Indeed, assuming this conjecture, they prove that for every large $y$ there are infinitely many $x$ such that\\[\\pi(x+y)>\\pi(x)+\\pi(y)+(\\log 2-o(1))\\frac{y}{(\\log y)^2},\\]where the $o(1)$ term tends to $0$ as $y\\to \\infty$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er85c} reports Straus as remarking that the 'correct way' of stating this conjecture would have been\\[\\pi(x+y) \\leq \\pi(x)+2\\pi(y/2).\\]Clark and Jarvis \\cite{ClJa01} have shown this is also incompatible with the prime tuples conjecture.\n\nIn \\cite{Er85c} Erd\\H{o}s conjectures the weaker result (which in particular follows from the conjecture of Straus) that\\[\\pi(x+y) \\leq \\pi(x)+\\pi(y)+O\\left(\\frac{y}{(\\log y)^2}\\right),\\]which the Hensley and Richards result shows (conditionally) would be best possible. Richards conjectured that this is false.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Richards further conjectured that the original inequality is true almost always - that is, the set of $x$ such that $\\pi(x+y)\\leq \\pi(x)+\\pi(y)$ for all $y<x$ has density $1$. They could only prove that this set has positive lower density.\n\nThey also conjectured that for every $x$ the inequality $\\pi(x+y)\\leq \\pi(x)+\\pi(y)$ is true provided $y \\gg (\\log x)^C$ for some large constant $C>0$.\n\nHardy and Littlewood proved\\[\\pi(x+y) \\leq \\pi(x)+O(\\pi(y)).\\]The best known in this direction is a result of Montgomery and Vaughan \\cite{MoVa73}, which shows\\[\\pi(x+y) \\leq \\pi(x)+2\\frac{y}{\\log y}.\\]This is discussed in problem A9 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ClJa01] Clark, David A. and Jarvis, Norman C., Dense admissible sequences.
