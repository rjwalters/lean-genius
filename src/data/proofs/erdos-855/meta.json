    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #855: The Second Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture**\n\nThis problem concerns a fundamental inequality in the distribution of primes.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Hardy-Littlewood: Original conjecture π(x+y) ≤ π(x) + π(y)\n- Erdős (1985): Described it as 'an old conjecture of mine which was probably already stated by Hardy and Littlewood'\n- Hensley-Richards (1973): Proved incompatibility with the prime k-tuples conjecture\n- Montgomery-Vaughan (1973): Proved π(x+y) ≤ π(x) + 2y/log(y) unconditionally\n\n**The Tension:** This conjecture and the prime k-tuples conjecture cannot both be true!",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open, Likely False)**\n\nIf $\\pi(x)$ counts the number of primes in $[1,x]$, is it true that for all sufficiently large $x$ and $y$:\n$$\\pi(x+y) \\leq \\pi(x) + \\pi(y)$$?\n\n**Status:** OPEN but LIKELY FALSE\n\n**Key Result:** Hensley and Richards (1973) proved this is **incompatible** with the prime k-tuples conjecture. Under k-tuples:\n$$\\pi(x+y) > \\pi(x) + \\pi(y) + (\\log 2 - o(1))\\frac{y}{(\\log y)^2}$$\nfor infinitely many x.\n\nSince the k-tuples conjecture is widely believed, this conjecture is likely false.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Prime Counting Function:** Define π(n) as the count of primes ≤ n.\n\n2. **Main Conjecture:** Formalize the Second Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture.\n\n3. **k-Tuples Conjecture:** Define admissible tuples and the prime k-tuples conjecture.\n\n4. **Incompatibility:** State Hensley-Richards theorem showing the two conjectures conflict.\n\n5. **Unconditional Bounds:** Include Montgomery-Vaughan's π(x+y) ≤ π(x) + 2y/log(y).\n\n6. **Related Variants:** Straus's modification and Erdős's weaker conjecture.",

No explicit counterexample is known, but the incompatibility is a strong negative indicator.",
    "implications": "**Connections to Number Theory**\n\n1. **Prime Distribution:** Reveals subtle non-additive behavior of π(x)\n\n2. **k-Tuples Conjecture:** Highlights that dense prime patterns imply violations\n\n3. **Montgomery-Vaughan:** Best unconditional bound is π(x+y) ≤ π(x) + 2y/log(y)\n\n4. **Philosophical:** Two natural conjectures can be mutually exclusive",
