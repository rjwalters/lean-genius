    "historicalContext": "**Union-Free Families**\n\nA family of sets is union-free if no member equals the union of other members. This is a natural extremal problem: how large can such a family be?\n\n**Antichains**: If no set contains another, then certainly no set can be a union of others. So antichains are union-free.\n\n**Sperner's Theorem**: The largest antichain on {1,...,n} is the middle layer - sets of size n/2. This has C(n, n/2) elements.\n\n**Resolution**: Erdős-Kleitman proved F(n) = C(n, n/2), and Hunter observed this follows from Problem 447 on 2-union-free families.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet F(n) be the maximum size of a family of subsets of {1,...,n} such that no set in the family is the union of other members.\n\nIs there a constant c > 0 such that F(n) ~ c · 2^n / √n?\n\n**Status**: SOLVED\n\n**Answer**: YES. F(n) = C(n, n/2) ~ √(2/π) · 2^n / √n.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach**\n\n1. **Lower Bound**: The middle layer (sets of size n/2) is an antichain, hence union-free. Size = C(n, n/2).\n\n2. **Upper Bound (Erdős-Kleitman)**: No union-free family can exceed C(n, n/2).\n\n3. **Asymptotics**: By Stirling, C(n, n/2) ~ √(2/π) · 2^n / √n.\n\n4. **Hunter's Observation**: Problem 447 (2-union-free) has the same answer, and union-free ⊆ 2-union-free.\n\n**Key Insight**: The antichain bound is tight for union-free families.",
