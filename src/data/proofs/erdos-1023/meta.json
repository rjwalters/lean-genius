Is it true that there is a constant $c>0$ such that\\[F(n)\\sim c \\frac{2^n}{n^{1/2}}?\\]\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Kleitman proved in unpublished work that\\[F(n)\\asymp \\frac{2^n}{n^{1/2}}.\\](\\cite{Er71} has an exponent of $3/2$, but this is presumably a typo.)\n\nHunter observes in the comments that this follows from the solution to [447], which implies $F(n)\\sim \\binom{n}{n/2}$.\n\nIf we only rule out solutions to $A=B\\cup C$ (that is, forbid a set being the union of two other sets in the family) then this is the subject of [447].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er71] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis.
