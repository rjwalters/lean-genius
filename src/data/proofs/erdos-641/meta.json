  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Chromatic Number and Substructures**\n\nHigh chromatic number forces various substructures: long odd cycles, large cliques (if triangle-free is ruled out), etc. Erdős and Hajnal asked whether it also forces edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertex set.\n\n**The Key Observation**: k edge-disjoint cycles on the same vertices form a 2k-regular subgraph. So the question becomes: does high χ imply regular subgraphs?\n\n**The Surprise**: Janzer-Steiner-Sudakov (2024) showed the answer is NO, even for k = 2. There exist graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number but no 4-regular subgraph.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIs there a function f such that for all k ≥ 1, if χ(G) ≥ f(k), then G contains k edge-disjoint cycles on the same set of vertices?\n\n**Answer**: NO (DISPROVED)\n\nJanzer-Steiner-Sudakov showed this fails even for k = 2:\n- There exist n-vertex graphs with χ ≥ c · (log log n)/(log log log n)\n- Yet these graphs contain no 4-regular subgraph",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Formalization**\n\n1. Defines chromatic number and k-colorability\n2. Defines cycles and edge-disjoint cycles\n3. Defines regular subgraphs\n4. Shows k edge-disjoint cycles ↔ 2k-regular subgraph\n5. States the Erdős-Hajnal conjecture\n6. Focuses on k = 2 case (4-regular subgraph)\n7. Axiomatizes JSS counterexample construction\n8. Proves the conjecture is FALSE\n9. Notes positive results that ARE true (odd cycles, Gyárfás)",
