Let $G$ be a graph such that every subgraph $H$ contains an independent set of size $\\geq (n-k)/2$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $H$. Must $G$ have chromatic number at most $k+2$?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal \\cite{ErHa67b}. The case $k=0$ is trivial, but they could not prove this even for $k=1$.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Folkman \\cite{Fo70b}.\n\nSee also [73].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErHa67b] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, Andr\\'as, On chromatic graphs.
