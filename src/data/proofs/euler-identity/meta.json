    "historicalContext": "Euler's Identity first appeared in Leonhard Euler's masterwork *Introductio in analysin infinitorum* (1748), though Euler himself may never have written it in the now-famous form e^(iπ) + 1 = 0.\n\nThe identity connects five of the most important numbers in mathematics:\n- **e** (~2.718): The base of natural logarithms, fundamental to calculus\n- **i** (√-1): The imaginary unit that extends the real numbers\n- **π** (~3.14159): The ratio of circumference to diameter\n- **1**: The multiplicative identity\n- **0**: The additive identity\n\nIn 1988, readers of *Mathematical Intelligencer* voted it 'the most beautiful theorem in mathematics.' Richard Feynman called it 'our jewel... the most remarkable formula in mathematics.'",
    "problemStatement": "**Euler's Identity:**\n\n$$e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$$\n\nEquivalently: $e^{i\\pi} = -1$\n\nThis follows from **Euler's Formula:** For any real number $x$,\n\n$$e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$$\n\nSubstituting $x = \\pi$ and using $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, we get $e^{i\\pi} = -1$.",
    "proofStrategy": "Our proof proceeds in three steps:\n\n1. **Establish Euler's Formula** (axiomatized): $e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$\n   - This can be proven via Taylor series or differential equations\n   - We take it as our starting point\n\n2. **Substitute $x = \\pi$:**\n   - $e^{i\\pi} = \\cos(\\pi) + i\\sin(\\pi)$\n   - $= -1 + i \\cdot 0$\n   - $= -1$\n\n3. **Add 1 to both sides:**\n   - $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = -1 + 1 = 0$\n\nThe proof is almost embarrassingly simple—yet it reveals deep connections between exponentials, trigonometry, and complex numbers.",

This unification powers Fourier analysis, quantum mechanics, electrical engineering, and much of modern physics. The 'beauty' mathematicians see is really the recognition of deep structural unity.",
