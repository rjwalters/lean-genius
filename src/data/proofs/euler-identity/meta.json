    "historicalContext": "Euler's Identity first appeared in Leonhard Euler's masterwork Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748), though Euler himself may never have written it in the now-famous form e^(iπ) + 1 = 0.\n\nThe identity connects five of the most important numbers in mathematics:\n- e (~2.718): The base of natural logarithms, fundamental to calculus\n- i (√-1): The imaginary unit that extends the real numbers\n- π (~3.14159): The ratio of circumference to diameter\n- 1: The multiplicative identity\n- 0: The additive identity\n\nIn 1988, readers of Mathematical Intelligencer voted it 'the most beautiful theorem in mathematics.' Richard Feynman called it 'our jewel... the most remarkable formula in mathematics.'",
    "problemStatement": "Euler's Identity:\n\n$$e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$$\n\nEquivalently: $e^{i\\pi} = -1$\n\nThis follows from Euler's Formula: For any real number $x$,\n\n$$e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$$\n\nSubstituting $x = \\pi$ and using $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, we get $e^{i\\pi} = -1$.",
    "proofStrategy": "This proof uses Mathlib's complete formalization of complex analysis:\n\n1. Import Mathlib's Complex Numbers: We use Complex, Complex.I, and Complex.exp from Mathlib, which provides all arithmetic properties.\n\n2. Apply Euler's Formula (Complex.exp_mul_I): This Mathlib theorem states $e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i\\sin(x)$.\n\n3. Use Trigonometric Values: Mathlib provides Real.cos_pi = -1 and Real.sin_pi = 0.\n\n4. Combine: Substituting $x = \\pi$ gives $e^{i\\pi} = -1 + 0i = -1$, so $e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$.\n\nThe entire proof is two lines using Lean tactics.",

    "summary": "Euler's Identity e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 is now fully verified using Mathlib's complex analysis library. The proof requires no axioms—everything derives from Mathlib's foundational definitions of real numbers, complex numbers, and the exponential function.",
    "implications": "The identity is more than a curiosity: it's the tip of an iceberg. Complex exponentials unify exponential growth, oscillation, and rotation. This unification powers Fourier analysis, quantum mechanics, electrical engineering, and much of modern physics. The 'beauty' mathematicians see is really the recognition of deep structural unity.",
