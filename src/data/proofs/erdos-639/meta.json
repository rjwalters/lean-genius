    "historicalContext": "**Monochromatic Triangles and Edge Covering**\n\nWhen edges of the complete graph K_n are 2-colored, Ramsey theory guarantees monochromatic triangles for n ≥ 6 (since R(3,3) = 6). But how many edges can avoid being part of ANY monochromatic triangle?\n\n**The Conjecture**: Erdős conjectured the answer is at most n²/4, achieved by the balanced bipartite coloring where edges between two halves are one color and edges within each half are another.\n\n**Progress**:\n- Erdős-Rousseau-Schelp (unpublished): proved for large n\n- Pyber (1986): showed ⌊n²/4⌋+2 mono cliques cover all edges\n- Keevash-Sudakov (2004): determined exact threshold for ALL n",

Axiomatizes Keevash-Sudakov main theorem for n ≥ 7\n7. States the extremal bipartite construction\n8. Connects to Ramsey theory (R(3,3) = 6)\n9. States Pyber's covering result",
