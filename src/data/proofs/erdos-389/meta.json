  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Straus posed this problem on whether the product of k consecutive integers starting at n always divides the product of the next k consecutive integers, for some k depending on n. The problem appeared in Erdős–Graham (1980). Bhavik Mehta computed minimal k values for small n, revealing surprisingly large values (e.g., 207 for n = 4).",
    "problemStatement": "For every n ≥ 1, does there exist k ≥ 1 such that n(n+1)···(n+k−1) | (n+k)(n+k+1)···(n+2k−1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the divisibility condition, state the main conjecture, verify small cases (n = 1,2,3), record Mehta's computation for n = 4, and connect the product ratio to binomial coefficients.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The divisibility holds iff the product ∏(n+k+i)/(n+i) is an integer",
      "For n = 1, k = 1 works trivially; for n = 2, k = 5; for n = 3, k = 4",
      "The minimal k for n = 4 jumps to 207 — much larger than small cases suggest",
      "Minimal k values form OEIS sequence A375071",
      "The product consecutiveProd n k equals k! · C(n+k−1, k)"
