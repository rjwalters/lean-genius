In particular, is it true that $g(n) \\sim 2n^{1/2}$?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\nMrose (1979) disproved the conjecture by showing $g(n)^2 \\leq \\frac{7}{2}n$.\n\n**Current Best Bounds:**\n$(2.181\\ldots + o(1))n \\leq g(n)^2 \\leq (3.458\\ldots + o(1))n$\n\nThis means $1.477\\sqrt{n} \\lesssim g(n) \\lesssim 1.860\\sqrt{n}$, far from Erdős's conjectured $2\\sqrt{n}$.",
