    "coreIssue": "ORIGINAL ISSUE: The axiom concentration_near_blowup assumed a SINGLE ball captures θ ≥ 1/2 of enstrophy. CKN partial regularity doesn't force this.\n\nREVISED APPROACH: The new finite_bubble_concentration axiom only requires K disjoint balls to capture θₖ ≥ c total. Since Faber-Krahn is ADDITIVE over disjoint balls, the proof works with this weaker hypothesis.\n\nKEY INSIGHT: If K = 10 balls suffice with θ₁₀ ≥ 2.5, this is MUCH weaker than requiring θ ≥ 0.5 for a single ball. The question becomes: is the bubble count K bounded independent of scale near blowup?",

This remains one of the great unsolved problems in mathematics.",

When β → 0 and θₖ bounded below: eventually S < νP (PROVED)\n5. Therefore E' = 2S - 2νP < 0, contradicting blowup (PROVED)\n\nThe gap: Step 2-3 requires θₖ ≥ c for some fixed K.
