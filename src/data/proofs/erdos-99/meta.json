    "historicalContext": "**Optimal Packing and Lattice Structure**\n\nThis problem connects optimal circle packing to the structure of point configurations. Given n points with minimum pairwise distance 1, minimizing the diameter forces points to pack efficiently.\n\n**Thue's Theorem**: The optimal packing density in ℝ² is achieved by the triangular (hexagonal) lattice. Thus, diameter-minimizing configurations should resemble a circular region of the triangular lattice.\n\n**The Conjecture**: If the configuration must resemble the triangular lattice, it should contain unit equilateral triangles - the fundamental building blocks of that lattice.\n\n**Erdős's Surprise**: He wrote: 'I could not prove it but felt that it should not be hard. To my great surprise both B. H. Sendov and M. Simonovits doubted the truth of this conjecture.'\n\n**The Prize Asymmetry**: Erdős offered $100 for a counterexample but only $50 for a proof - suggesting he suspected the conjecture might be false!",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet A ⊆ ℝ² be n points with minimum distance 1, chosen to minimize the diameter of A. For sufficiently large n, must A contain three points forming a unit equilateral triangle?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Prize**: $100 for counterexample, $50 for proof\n\n**Small Cases**:\n- n = 3: Triangle (yes, trivially)\n- n = 4: Square vertices work (NO equilateral triangle!)\n- Small n: Explored by Bezdek-Fodor (1999)\n\n**Erdős's Stronger Belief**: Such configurations should have (1-o(1))n points on the triangular lattice.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approaches**\n\n**For a Proof**:\n1. Show diameter-minimizing sets must have large triangular lattice intersection\n2. Any sufficiently large lattice region contains equilateral triangles\n3. Quantify 'sufficiently large' n\n\n**For a Counterexample**:\n1. Find non-lattice configurations with small diameter\n2. Avoid equilateral triangles while maintaining minimum distance 1\n3. The n=4 square example suggests this might be possible\n\n**Why It's Hard**:\n- Thue's theorem is asymptotic - small deviations from lattice structure are allowed\n- Non-lattice configurations can have comparable diameter\n- The transition from 'approximately lattice' to 'contains lattice triangle' is subtle\n\n**Bezdek-Fodor Analysis**:\n- Classified optimal configurations for small n\n- Found that lattice structure emerges gradually\n- Transition behavior suggests the problem is delicate",
