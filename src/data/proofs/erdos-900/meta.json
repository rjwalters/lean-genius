    "historicalContext": "**Random Graphs and Long Paths**\n\nThe Erdős-Rényi random graph G(n, m) is the uniform distribution over graphs with n vertices and m edges. When m = cn for constant c, this is the 'sparse' regime.\n\n**Phase Transition at c = 1/2**: Below this threshold, the graph is a forest (whp). Above it, a 'giant component' of size Θ(n) emerges.\n\n**Erdős's Question**: How long is the longest path in G(n, cn)? The answer depends on c:\n- For c < 1/2: O(log n) (logarithmic)\n- For c > 1/2: Θ(n) (linear in n)\n\n**The Solution**: Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi (1981) proved there exists f(c) such that the longest path has length approximately f(c)·n, where f(c) → 0 as c → 1/2 and f(c) → 1 as c → ∞.",

G(n, cn) has (with high probability) a path of length at least f(c)·n\n\n**Answer**: PROVED by Ajtai-Komlós-Szemerédi (1981)\n\nThe function f(c) captures the phase transition from logarithmic to linear path lengths.",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Formalization**\n\n1. Defines the Erdős-Rényi model G(n, m)\n2. Defines paths and path length\n3. Sets up probabilistic framework (whp events)\n4. States the giant component phase transition at c = 1/2\n5. Defines the path length function f(c)\n6. States its limiting behavior (→ 0 at 1/2, → 1 at ∞)\n7. Axiomatizes the AKS theorem\n8. Covers subcritical regime (O(log n) paths)\n9. Covers Hamiltonian path threshold",
