    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #446**\n\nThis problem studies the density of integers having a divisor in the interval (n, 2n). It has a rich 74-year history from Besicovitch to Ford.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- **1934 Besicovitch:** Proved liminf δ(n) = 0\n- **1935 Erdős:** Proved δ(n) = o(1) (density → 0)\n- **1960 Erdős:** First quantitative bound with the correct exponent α ≈ 0.08607\n- **1984 Tenenbaum:** Refined estimates, casting doubt on δ₁(n) = o(δ(n))\n- **2008 Ford:** Complete resolution - exact asymptotics and disproof of the secondary conjecture\n\n**Erdős's Doubt:**\nAt Oberwolfach in 1986, Erdős said he was \"quite sure\" that δ₁(n) = o(δ(n)), but noted that \"recent results of Tenenbaum throw some doubt on this.\" His doubt was justified - Ford disproved it.",

    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Basic Definitions:**\n   - hasDivisorInInterval: existence of d ∈ (n, 2n) with d | m\n   - delta(n): asymptotic density of such integers\n   - deltaR(n, r): density with exactly r divisors in interval\n\n2. **The Constant α:**\n   - Defined explicitly: α = 1 - (1 + log log 2)/log 2\n   - Numerical bounds: 0.086 < α < 0.087\n\n3. **Historical Results:**\n   - Besicovitch (liminf), Erdős (o(1) and exponent), Tenenbaum (refinement)\n\n4. **Ford's Resolution:**\n   - ford_2008_main: exact asymptotic δ(n) ≍ 1/((log n)^α (log log n)^{3/2})\n   - ford_2008_disproof: δ₁(n) is NOT o(δ(n))\n   - ford_2008_general: generalization to δᵣ(n)\n\n5. **Why Axioms:** Ford's proof uses deep analytic number theory beyond Mathlib",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #446 was completely resolved by Kevin Ford in 2008. The density δ(n) of integers with a divisor in (n, 2n) decays like 1/((log n)^α (log log n)^{3/2}) where α ≈ 0.08607. Erdős's secondary conjecture that δ₁(n) = o(δ(n)) was disproved - in fact, δᵣ(n) ≫ δ(n) for all r.",
    "implications": "The result shows that divisors in (n, 2n) are surprisingly common and well-distributed by count. Ford's methods advance analytic number theory techniques for divisor distribution problems.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What are the exact constants in the asymptotic?",
      "How does the distribution of divisor counts vary with n?",
      "Can similar results be proved for other intervals like (n, cn) for c > 2?"
