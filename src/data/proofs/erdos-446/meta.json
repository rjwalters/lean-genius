What is the growth rate of $\\delta(n)$?\n\nIf $\\delta_1(n)$ is the density of integers which have exactly one divisor in $(n,2n)$ then is it true that $\\delta_1(n)=o(\\delta(n))$?\n\n\n\nBesicovitch \\cite{Be34} proved that $\\liminf \\delta(n)=0$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er35} proved that $\\delta(n)=o(1)$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er60} proved that $\\delta(n)=(\\log n)^{-\\alpha+o(1)}$ where\\[\\alpha=1-\\frac{1+\\log\\log 2}{\\log 2}=0.08607\\cdots.\\]This estimate was refined by Tenenbaum \\cite{Te84}, and the true growth rate of $\\delta(n)$ was determined by Ford \\cite{Fo08} who proved\\[\\delta(n)\\asymp \\frac{1}{(\\log n)^\\alpha(\\log\\log n)^{3/2}}.\\]Erd\\H{o}s asked this at Oberwolfach in 1986, and wrote he was 'quite sure' that $\\delta_1(n)=o(\\delta(n))$, but that 'recent results of Tenenbaum throw some doubt on this'.\n\nIndeed, this was disproved by Ford \\cite{Fo08}, who showed more generally that if $\\delta_r(n)$ is the density of integers with exactly $r$ divisors in $(n,2n)$ then $\\delta_r(n)\\gg_r\\delta(n)$.\n\nSee also [448], [692], and [693].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Be34] Besicovitch, A., On the density of certain sequences of integers.
