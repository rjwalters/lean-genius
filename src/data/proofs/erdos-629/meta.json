  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Introduced by Erdős, Rubin, and Taylor in 1980. They proved n(2) = 6 and gave initial bounds. Hanson, MacGillivray, and Toft (1996) found n(3) = 14 and a recursive bound. Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan (2000) improved the lower bound using probabilistic methods. Related to Problem #901 on Property B.",
    "problemStatement": "The list chromatic number χ_L(G) is the minimal k such that for any assignment of lists of k colors to vertices, a proper coloring exists from the lists. Find n(k) = minimum number of vertices in a bipartite graph G with χ_L(G) > k.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize list colorings, list chromatic number, and the function n(k). The exact values n(2) = 6 and n(3) = 14 are stated, along with the original and improved bounds. The connection to Property B is captured.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #629 on list chromatic numbers of bipartite graphs. The central surprise is that while bipartite graphs are 2-colorable, their list chromatic number can be arbitrarily large. The exact asymptotic behavior of n(k) remains open.",
