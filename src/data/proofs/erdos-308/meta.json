    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #308 concerns Egyptian fractions with bounded denominators. Given N ≥ 1, we ask: which integers can be written as sums of distinct unit fractions 1/k where k ∈ {1,...,N}?\n\nThe maximum possible sum is H_N = 1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N, the N-th harmonic number. Since H_N ~ ln(N) + γ (where γ is Euler's constant), we can represent integers up to about ln(N).\n\nCroot (1999) proved definitive bounds on f(N), the smallest non-representable integer. His key result shows f(N) = ⌊H_N⌋ - O((log log N)²/log N), with the coefficient in [1/2, 9/2]. This implies the representable set is {0, 1, ..., m} for some m close to ⌊H_N⌋.\n\nThe problem connects to Egyptian fraction theory, which dates back to ancient Egypt (Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, ~1650 BCE). Every positive rational has an Egyptian fraction representation, but bounded denominators create subtle constraints.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet $N \\geq 1$. Consider sums of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$:\n$$S = \\sum_{k \\in T} \\frac{1}{k} \\text{ for some } T \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$$\n\n**Questions:**\n1. What is $f(N)$, the smallest non-negative integer not representable as such a sum?\n2. Is the set of representable integers always contiguous: $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, m\\}$ for some $m$?\n\n**Answers (Croot 1999):**\n1. $\\lfloor H_N - \\frac{9}{2}\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\rfloor \\leq f(N) \\leq \\lfloor H_N - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\rfloor$\n2. YES for sufficiently large $N$: representable set is $\\{0,\\ldots,\\lfloor H_N\\rfloor-1\\}$ or $\\{0,\\ldots,\\lfloor H_N\\rfloor\\}$",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines unit fractions, their sums, and the harmonic number H_N. Representability is expressed as the existence of a subset S ⊆ {1,...,N} whose unit fractions sum to the target integer. The key function f(N) gives the smallest non-representable integer. Croot's bounds are axiomatized, along with the contiguity result. Small examples illustrate the concepts.",

The second-order correction term (log log N)²/log N reveals subtle structure in how unit fractions combine.
