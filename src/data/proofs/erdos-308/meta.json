What is the smallest integer not representable as the sum of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$? Is it true that the set of integers representable as such has the shape $\\{1,\\ldots,m\\}$ for some $m$?\n\n\n\nThis was essentially solved by Croot \\cite{Cr99}, who proved that if $f(N)$ is the smallest integer not representable then\\[\\left\\lfloor\\sum_{n\\leq N}\\frac{1}{n}-\\frac{9}{2}(1+o(1))\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\right\\rfloor\\leq f(N)\\]and\\[f(N)\\leq \\left\\lfloor\\sum_{n\\leq N}\\frac{1}{n}-\\frac{1}{2}(1+o(1))\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\right\\rfloor.\\]It follows that, if $m_N=\\lfloor \\sum_{n\\leq N}\\frac{1}{n}\\rfloor$, then the set of integers representable is, for all $N$ sufficiently large, either $\\{1,\\ldots,m_N-1\\}$ or $\\{1,\\ldots,m_N\\}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cr99] Croot, III, Ernest S., On some questions of Erd\\H{o}s and Graham about Egyptian fractions.
