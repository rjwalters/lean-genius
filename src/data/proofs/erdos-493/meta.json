  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #493 from [Er61] (attributed to Schinzel) asks whether every sufficiently large integer can be written as the product minus the sum of k integers, each at least 2. Eli Seamans showed k=2 suffices via the identity n = 2(n+2) - (2 + (n+2)).",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist k such that every sufficiently large n can be expressed as product(a1,...,ak) - sum(a1,...,ak) with all ai >= 2? SOLVED: yes, k = 2.",
    "proofStrategy": "The key identity 2(n+2) - (2 + (n+2)) = n is verified by ring. For n >= 0, b = n+2 >= 2, so both entries satisfy the constraint. The proof is fully constructive.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The identity 2(n+2) - (2+(n+2)) = n solves the problem for k = 2",
      "For n >= 0, both a = 2 and b = n+2 satisfy the constraint ai >= 2",
      "The proof is constructive: given n, the witness is immediate",
      "Originally attributed to Schinzel, possibly with additional constraints",
      "One of the simpler Erdős problems with a clean closed-form solution"
