  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1982 [Er82e, p.78]. Size Ramsey numbers, introduced by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp in 1978, measure the minimum edge complexity of Ramsey graphs.\n\nMajor results include:\n- Beck (1983): Paths have linear size Ramsey numbers R̂(Pₙ) = O(n)\n- Rödl-Szemerédi (2000): Complete graphs have R̂(Kₙ) = Θ(n²)\n- Kohayakawa-Rödl-Schacht-Szemerédi (2011): Bounded degree graphs have linear R̂\n\nThe question asks whether edge density forces additional Ramsey complexity.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nDoes there exist a function f(x) with f(x)/x → ∞ as x → ∞ such that:\n\nFor all sufficiently large constants C, if G is a graph with n vertices and at least Cn edges, then the size Ramsey number satisfies:\n$$\\hat{R}(G) > f(C) \\cdot e(G)$$\n\nwhere e(G) is the number of edges in G.\n\n**Background:**\nThe size Ramsey number R̂(G) is the minimum number of edges m in a graph H such that any 2-coloring of H's edges contains a monochromatic copy of G.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Custom SimpleGraph' structure with adjacency, symmetry, and no loops\n\n2. **Size Ramsey:** Axiomatize sizeRamseyNumber as minimum edges for Ramsey property\n\n3. **Density Condition:** isDense(G, C) := e(G) ≥ C·n\n\n4. **The Conjecture:** ErdosConjecture911 formalizes the existence of superlinear f\n\n5. **Known Results:** Axiomatize Beck, Rödl-Szemerédi, and KRSS theorems",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Trivial Bound:** R̂(G) ≥ e(G) always - the Ramsey graph must contain G",
      "**Paths are Easy:** R̂(Pₙ) = O(n) - Beck's theorem shows paths need few edges",
      "**Complete Graphs:** R̂(Kₙ) = Θ(n²) - linear in edge count, not superlinear",
      "**Bounded Degree:** KRSS theorem: bounded max degree implies linear R̂",
      "**The Question:** Does density alone (not structure) force superlinear R̂?"
