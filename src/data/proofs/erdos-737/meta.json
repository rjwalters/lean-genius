  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #737**\n\nThis problem connects the chromatic number of infinite graphs to their cycle structure.\n\n**History:**\n- Erdős, Hajnal, and Shelah (1974) posed the problem and proved that graphs with χ(G) = ℵ₁ contain all sufficiently large cycles\n- They asked whether the cycles could all pass through a single edge\n- Thomassen (1983) proved YES in a short paper in Combinatorica\n\n**Context:** The uncountable chromatic number ℵ₁ is a critical threshold. Finite or countably infinite chromatic number doesn't give this strong cycle property.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet G be a graph with chromatic number ℵ₁.\n\n**Question:** Must there exist an edge e such that, for all large n, G contains a cycle of length n containing e?\n\n**EHS (1974):** Proved G contains all large cycles.\n\n**Thomassen (1983):** Proved YES - such an edge exists.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Basics:** Use SimpleGraph from Mathlib\n\n2. **Cardinal Numbers:** Use Cardinal.aleph for ℵ₁\n\n3. **Cycle Definitions:**\n   - hasCycleOfLength: cycle existence\n   - edgeInCycleOfLength: edge in specific cycle\n   - edgeInAllLargeCycles: edge in all large cycles\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - EHS 1974: all large cycles exist\n   - Thomassen 1983: edge in all large cycles\n\n**Why Axioms:** The proofs involve sophisticated infinite graph theory beyond current Mathlib.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #737 was solved by Thomassen in 1983. If a graph G has chromatic number ℵ₁, then there exists an edge e such that G contains a cycle of length n through e for all sufficiently large n. This strengthens the EHS result that such graphs contain all large cycles.",
    "implications": "The result shows that uncountable chromatic number forces very strong cycle structure. Not only do all large cycles exist, but they can be 'routed' through a single edge. This connects chromatic theory to cycle theory in infinite graphs.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "How many edges have the 'all large cycles' property?",
      "What is the minimum N such that the edge is in all cycles of length ≥ N?",
      "Do similar results hold for larger cardinal numbers?"
