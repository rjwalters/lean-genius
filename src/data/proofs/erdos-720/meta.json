    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #720 (Size Ramsey Numbers of Paths and Cycles)**\n\n**Origin:**\nErdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp posed this problem in 1978. The size Ramsey number R̂(G) is the minimum number of edges m such that some graph H with m edges guarantees a monochromatic copy of G under any 2-edge-coloring.\n\n**The Questions:**\n1. For paths Pₙ: Does R̂(Pₙ)/n → ∞ and R̂(Pₙ)/n² → 0?\n2. For cycles Cₙ: Does R̂(Cₙ) = o(n²)?\n\n**Beck's Breakthrough (1983):**\nBeck proved a much stronger result: R̂(Pₙ) ≪ n and R̂(Cₙ) ≪ n. Both size Ramsey numbers are LINEAR in n, not just subquadratic!\n\n**Current Best Bounds:**\n- Paths: 3.75n ≤ R̂(Pₙ) ≤ 900n (Dudek-Prałat 2017)\n- The exact constant remains unknown",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet R̂(G) denote the size Ramsey number: the minimal number of edges m such that there exists a graph H with m edges where any 2-coloring of edges of H contains a monochromatic copy of G.\n\n**Questions:**\n1a. Does R̂(Pₙ)/n → ∞?\n1b. Does R̂(Pₙ)/n² → 0?\n2. Does R̂(Cₙ) = o(n²)?\n\n**Answers:**\n1a. NO — R̂(Pₙ)/n is bounded (Beck 1983)\n1b. YES — in fact R̂(Pₙ) = O(n), so R̂(Pₙ)/n² → 0\n2. YES — in fact R̂(Cₙ) = O(n), much stronger than o(n²)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Model:** GraphOnN, numEdges for finite graphs\n\n2. **Path/Cycle Graphs:** PathGraph, CycleGraph definitions\n\n3. **Coloring Framework:** EdgeColoring, IsMonochromatic, ContainsMonochromaticCopy\n\n4. **Size Ramsey:** sizeRamseyNumber as minimal m\n\n5. **Original Questions:** ErdosQuestion720a/b/c\n\n6. **Beck's Theorem:** beck_path_theorem, beck_cycle_theorem (linear bounds)\n\n7. **Bounds:** Lower and upper bounds, Dudek-Prałat 900n\n\n8. **Answers:** answer_720a (NO), answer_720b (YES), answer_720c (YES)",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #720 asks about the asymptotic growth of size Ramsey numbers for paths and cycles. Beck (1983) proved both R̂(Pₙ) and R̂(Cₙ) are linear in n — much stronger than the original conjectures. The answer to 'R̂(Pₙ)/n → ∞?' is NO (it's bounded), while 'R̂(Pₙ)/n² → 0?' and 'R̂(Cₙ) = o(n²)?' are both YES.",
