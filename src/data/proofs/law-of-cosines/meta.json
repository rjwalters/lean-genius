    "historicalContext": "The Law of Cosines has ancient origins:\n\n- **Euclid (~300 BCE)**: Elements Book II, Propositions 12-13 contain geometric equivalents\n- **al-Kashi (1420s)**: First modern trigonometric formulation (sometimes called al-Kashi's theorem)\n- **Modern form**: Became standard with the development of trigonometry\n\nThe theorem is fundamental to surveying, navigation, and physics.",
    "problemStatement": "**The Law of Cosines**:\n\nFor a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $c$ and angle $C$ opposite side $c$:\n\n$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\\cos(C)$$\n\n**Special case**: When $C = 90°$, $\\cos(C) = 0$, giving the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$\n\n**Inner product form**: For vectors $v$ and $w$:\n$$\\|v - w\\|^2 = \\|v\\|^2 + \\|w\\|^2 - 2\\langle v, w \\rangle$$",
    "proofStrategy": "We prove this using the inner product structure:\n\n1. **Start with $\\|v - w\\|^2$**:\n   $$\\|v - w\\|^2 = \\langle v - w, v - w \\rangle$$\n\n2. **Expand using linearity**:\n   $$= \\langle v, v \\rangle - \\langle v, w \\rangle - \\langle w, v \\rangle + \\langle w, w \\rangle$$\n\n3. **Use symmetry** ($\\langle v, w \\rangle = \\langle w, v \\rangle$):\n   $$= \\|v\\|^2 + \\|w\\|^2 - 2\\langle v, w \\rangle$$\n\n4. **For perpendicular vectors** ($\\langle v, w \\rangle = 0$):\n   $$\\|v - w\\|^2 = \\|v\\|^2 + \\|w\\|^2$$\n\nThis is the Pythagorean theorem as a special case.",
