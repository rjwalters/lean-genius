  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects combinatorial geometry with Diophantine approximation. The function N(X,δ) measures how many points can be placed in a disk while keeping all pairwise distances 'far' from integers. Erdős asked about the growth rate: is it sublinear? Is it at most X^{1/2}? Both were answered affirmatively, with Konyagin's 2001 result giving the optimal bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let N(X,δ) denote the maximum number of points P₁,...,Pₙ that can be chosen in a circle of radius X such that ‖|Pᵢ - Pⱼ|‖ ≥ δ for all i ≠ j, where ‖x‖ is the distance from x to the nearest integer. Questions: (1) Is N(X,δ) = o(X) for any 0 < δ < 1/2? (2) Is N(X,δ) < X^{1/2+o(1)} for any fixed δ > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The first conjecture was proved by Sárközy (1976) using analytic number theory techniques, giving N(X,δ) ≪ δ⁻³ · X / log log X. Konyagin (2001) used Fourier analysis and exponential sum estimates to prove the much stronger bound N(X,δ) ≪_δ X^{1/2}. This is optimal, as Problem #466 shows matching lower bounds.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #465 is completely solved. Both conjectures are true: N(X,δ) = o(X) and N(X,δ) < X^{1/2+o(1)}. The optimal bound N(X,δ) ≍ X^{1/2} was established by Konyagin (2001) for the upper bound and Problem #466 for the lower bound.",
    "implications": "This result shows that the constraint of avoiding integer distances is very restrictive. Even in a large disk, only about √X points can satisfy this constraint. The techniques developed (exponential sums, Fourier analysis) are broadly applicable in combinatorial geometry and Diophantine approximation.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact dependence of the constant on δ?",
      "How does the answer change in higher dimensions?",
      "What happens for other notions of 'avoiding integers' (different metrics)?"
