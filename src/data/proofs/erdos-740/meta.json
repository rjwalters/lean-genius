  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Hajnal posed this problem about preserving chromatic number while avoiding short odd cycles. Rödl proved the case 𝔪 = ℵ₀ and r = 3 (triangle-free). Erdős listed this in [Er81] as one of the problems he 'would most like to see solved.' The general case and the threshold function f_r(𝔪) remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 𝔪 be an infinite cardinal and G be a graph with chromatic number 𝔪. Let r ≥ 1. Must G contain a subgraph of chromatic number 𝔪 which does not contain any odd cycle of length ≤ r?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize chromatic numbers for infinite graphs, cycles, and odd cycle avoidance. We state the Erdős-Hajnal conjecture, Rödl's theorem for the countable triangle-free case, and explore the girth variant. The bipartite case shows limits of what's possible.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Rödl proved: every ℵ₀-chromatic graph has a triangle-free subgraph with χ = ℵ₀",
      "The general case for arbitrary infinite cardinals remains open",
      "The threshold function f_r(𝔪) question asks for quantitative bounds",
      "The girth variant (avoiding ALL cycles ≤ r) implies the odd cycle version",
      "Bipartite graphs have χ ≤ 2, so the 'r = ∞' version fails for 𝔪 > 2"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #740 asks whether graphs with infinite chromatic number must contain subgraphs preserving that chromatic number while avoiding short odd cycles.
