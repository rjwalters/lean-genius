Let $r\\geq 1$. Must $G$ contain a subgraph of chromatic number $\\mathfrak{m}$ which does not contain any odd cycle of length $\\leq r$?\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal. R\\\"{o}dl proved this is true if $\\mathfrak{m}=\\aleph_0$ and $r=3$ (see [108] for the finitary version).\n\nMore generally, Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal asked must there exist (for every cardinal $\\mathfrak{m}$ and integer $r$) some $f_r(\\mathfrak{m})$ such that every graph with chromatic number $\\geq f_r(\\mathfrak{m})$ contains a subgraph with chromatic number $\\mathfrak{m}$ with no odd cycle of length $\\leq r$?\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er95d} claimed that even the $r=3$ case of this is open: must every graph with sufficiently large chromatic number contain a triangle free graph with chromatic number $\\mathfrak{m}$?\n\nIn \\cite{Er81} Erd\\H{o}s also asks the same question but with girth (i.e. the subgraph does not contain any cycle at all of length $\\leq C$).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the combinatorial problems which I would most like to see solved.
