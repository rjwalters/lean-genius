  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears in Erdős and Graham's 1980 monograph 'Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory'. Egyptian fractions (sums of distinct unit fractions) have been studied since ancient Egypt. The function t(N) measures when we can no longer represent 1 as an Egyptian fraction with bounded denominators. Erdős and Graham proved t(N) ≪ N/log N but had 'no idea' of the true value. Liu and Sawhney settled this in 2024.",
    "problemStatement": "Let N ≥ 1 and let t(N) be the least integer t such that there is NO solution to 1 = 1/n₁ + 1/n₂ + ⋯ + 1/nₖ with t = n₁ < n₂ < ⋯ < nₖ ≤ N. Estimate t(N).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Egyptian fractions as sums over finite sets and the t(N) function as a minimum over non-representable starting points. The Erdős-Graham upper bound and Liu-Sawhney lower bound are axiomatized. The main theorem confirms t(N) ≍ N/((log N)(log log N)^O(1)).",

      "{2, 3, 6} represents 1: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1",
      "t(N) measures the 'density' of Egyptian representations of 1",
      "The harmonic sum H_N = ∑1/k ≈ log N plays a key role",
      "Almost all starting points t < N allow representations",
      "The gap between upper and lower bounds is only polylogarithmic"

    "summary": "Problem #294 is SOLVED. Erdős-Graham (1980) proved t(N) ≪ N/log N. Liu-Sawhney (2024) proved the matching lower bound t(N) ≫ N/((log N)(log log N)³...), determining t(N) up to polylogarithmic factors.",
