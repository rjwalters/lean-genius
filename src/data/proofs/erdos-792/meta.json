  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem is a cornerstone of additive combinatorics. Erdős established the basic n/3 lower bound. The problem appears as Problem 1 on Ben Green's open problems list. Recent work by Bedert (2025) achieved f(n) ≥ n/3 + c·log log n, while Eberhard-Green-Manners established f(n) ≤ n/3 + o(n).",
    "problemStatement": "A set B ⊆ ℤ is sum-free if there are no a, b, c ∈ B with a + b = c. Let f(n) be the maximum value such that every n-element subset A ⊆ ℤ contains a sum-free subset B with |B| ≥ f(n). Estimate f(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "The lower bound uses probabilistic and algebraic methods. The 'middle third' construction shows f(n) ≥ n/3. Improvements use Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics techniques. The upper bound constructs explicit sets with small sum-free subsets.",
