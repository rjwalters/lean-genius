We say that a set of primes $P$ is a covering set for $m$ if every $2^km+1$ is divisible by some $p\\in P$.\n\nAre there Sierpinski numbers with no finite covering set of primes?\n\n\n\nSierpinski \\cite{Si60} proved that there are infinitely many Sierpinski numbers, using covering systems to construct suitable covering sets for any $m$ satisfying a certain congruence. This establishes that there is a positive density set of such $m$.\n\nThe smallest Sierpinski number is believed to be $78557$, which was found by Selfridge.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{ErGr80} asked whether there are Sierpinski numbers for which a covering system is not 'responsible', for which the best interpretation seems to be the above question. This is formulated precisely in problem F13 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}. Erd\\H{o}s and Graham thought the answer is yes (in that there are such Sierpinski numbers), since otherwise this would imply there are infinitely many Fermat primes.\n\nThere is now further evidence with a concrete example: an argument of Izotov \\cite{Iz95}, given in more detail by Filaseta, Finch, and Kozek \\cite{FFK08}, suggests that $m=734110615000775^4$ is a Sierpinski number without a covering set. (Izotov proved that this $m$ is indeed a Sierpinski number.)\n\nFilaseta, Finch, and Kozek \\cite{FFK08} give a revised conjecture, suggesting that every Sierpinski number is either a perfect power or else has a finite covering set of primes. They also prove that for every $l\\geq 1$ there is an $m$ such that $2^km^i+1$ is composite for all $1\\leq i\\leq l$ and $k\\geq 0$.\n\nSee also [203], and [276] for another problem in which the question is whether covering systems are always responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
