  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem sits at the intersection of additive number theory and the distribution of primes. It asks whether, for each k >= 2, there exist integers n that can be represented as the sum of k many k-th powers of primes in arbitrarily many ways.\n\nErdős proved the case k=2 in his 1937 paper 'On the Sum and Difference of Squares of Primes' in the Journal of the London Mathematical Society. The proof uses the Hardy-Littlewood circle method combined with estimates for primes in arithmetic progressions. He also reportedly proved the k=3 case, though this proof appears to be unpublished.\n\nThe problem remains open for k >= 4. The difficulty increases with k because there are fewer k-th powers of primes below any given bound. The expected number of representations involves the singular series from the circle method, which becomes harder to analyze for larger k.",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdős Problem #979**: Let $k \\geq 2$, and let $f_k(n)$ count the number of solutions to\n$$n = p_1^k + p_2^k + \\cdots + p_k^k$$\nwhere the $p_i$ are prime numbers (with repetition allowed).\n\n**Question**: Is it true that $\\limsup_{n \\to \\infty} f_k(n) = \\infty$?\n\n**Status**: PARTIALLY SOLVED\n\n**Known Results**:\n- **k=2**: SOLVED by Erdős (1937) - There are infinitely many n with arbitrarily many representations as sums of two squares of primes\n- **k=3**: SOLVED by Erdős (unpublished) - Same result for cubes of primes\n- **k>=4**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem using multisets to represent solutions:\n\n1. **Define solutionSet(n,k)**: The set of all multisets P = {p_1,...,p_k} where each p_i is prime and the sum of their k-th powers equals n. Multisets naturally handle repeated primes.\n\n2. **Define f(k,n)**: The (extended natural number) cardinality of solutionSet(n,k). We use ℕ∞ to handle potentially infinite solution sets.\n\n3. **Axiomatize main results**: The theorems erdos_979_k2 and erdos_979_k3 state that Filter.limsup of f equals ⊤ (infinity) for k=2 and k=3. These require analytic number theory beyond Mathlib.\n\n4. **Provide concrete examples**: We axiomatize that 8 = 2^2 + 2^2 and 24 = 2^3 + 2^3 + 2^3 are valid solutions, demonstrating the definitions work.\n\n5. **Note connections**: The problem relates to Goldbach-type questions, Waring's problem, and the Hardy-Littlewood circle method.",

      "**Multiset representation**: A solution is a multiset {p_1,...,p_k} of k primes. Using multisets (not sets or tuples) correctly handles repeated primes like {2,2} for 8 = 2^2 + 2^2.",
      "**The counting function f_k(n)**: Counts distinct multisets, so f_2(8) >= 1 from {2,2}. The question is whether sup over n of f_k(n) is unbounded.",
      "**Why k matters**: For k=2, many primes p satisfy p^2 < n, giving more potential solutions. For larger k, the sparsity of k-th powers makes representations rarer.",
