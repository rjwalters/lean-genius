    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this in 1995, exploring the inverse totient problem. Every even number is a totient value, but the smallest preimage can vary wildly. For primes p, φ(p) = p−1 gives ratio p/(p−1) → 1. The question asks if there are infinitely many totient values where the ratio diverges.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there an infinite set A ⊂ ℕ such that each a ∈ A satisfies φ(n) = a for some n, yet the smallest such n satisfies n_a/a → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize totient preimages, the smallest preimage function, the main conjecture, and provide context from Carmichael's observation and prime-based bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "φ(p) = p−1 gives ratio p/(p−1) → 1: prime totient values have small ratios",
      "The conjecture requires finding values where the smallest preimage is disproportionately large",
