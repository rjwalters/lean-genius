    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this problem in 1980, asking whether any polynomial of degree ≥ 2 can perfectly tile the integers by translation. Sekanina (1959) had already shown this is impossible for f(x) = x², and the general question connects to factorization of abelian groups and additive number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there a polynomial f: ℤ → ℤ of degree ≥ 2 and a set A ⊆ ℤ such that ℤ = A ⊕ f(ℤ), meaning every integer has a unique representation z = a + f(n) with a ∈ A, n ∈ ℤ?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define perfect complements and state the main conjecture (no such polynomial exists). We record Sekanina's result for squares and the quadratic divisibility condition, then state conjectures for cubes and general monomials.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #477 asks whether polynomial images of degree ≥ 2 can perfectly tile the integers. Sekanina proved impossibility for squares, and partial results cover some quadratics, but the general question remains open. Erdős and Graham conjectured the answer is always no.",
    "implications": "Resolution would advance understanding of integer tilings by polynomial sequences, with connections to additive combinatorics, group factorizations, and the structure of sumsets.",
