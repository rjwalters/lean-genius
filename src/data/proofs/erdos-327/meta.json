  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether a subset of {1,...,N} avoiding the condition a+b | ab (equivalently, 1/a+1/b being a unit fraction) can be substantially larger than the odd numbers. Van Doorn proved that any set of size ≥ (25/28)N must contain such a pair. A variant with 2ab replacing ab asks whether avoiding sets must have o(N) elements.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊆ {1,...,N} with a+b ∤ ab for all distinct a,b ∈ A. Can |A| > (1/2+ε)N for some ε > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define SumNotDvdProd and SumNotDvdTwoProd as avoiding conditions, maxAvoidSize as the extremal function. The main conjecture states maxAvoidSize(N) ≤ (1/2+ε)N. Van Doorn's bound and the unit-fraction equivalence are axioms. Basic monotonicity properties are proved.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "a+b | ab is equivalent to 1/a + 1/b being a unit fraction 1/c",
      "Odd numbers naturally avoid the condition since a+b is even but ab is odd",
      "Van Doorn's threshold of 25/28 is the best known density bound",
      "The factor-of-2 variant may force o(N) size"
