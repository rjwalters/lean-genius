Must $G$ contain an odd cycle with at least two diagonals?\n\nMore generally, is there some $f(r)\\to \\infty$ such that every graph with chromatic number $4$, in which every subgraph on $\\leq r$ vertices has chromatic number $\\leq 3$, contains an odd cycle with at least $f(r)$ diagonals?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s originally asked about the existence of just one diagonal, which is true, and was proved by Larson \\cite{La79}. In fact Larson proved the following stronger conjecture of Bollob\\'{a}s and Erd\\H{o}s: if $G$ is a $K_4$-free graph containing no odd cycle with a diagonal then either $G$ is bipartite, or $G$ contains a cut vertex, or $G$ contains a vertex with degree $\\leq 2$.\n\nThe pentagonal wheel shows that three diagonals are not guaranteed.\n\nThe first question was solved in the affirmative by Voss \\cite{Vo82}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[La79] Larson, Jean A., Some graphs with chromatic number three.
