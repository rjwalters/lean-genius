(Although Hilton told Lagarias that this problem may have been formulated by Klarner, and that Erd\\H{o}s liked it and offered a prize for its solution.)\n\nErd\\H{o}s had earlier proved (as reported in \\cite{KlRa74}) that if $A$ is the smallest set which contains $1$ and is closed under the operations $x\\mapsto m_ix+b_i$ for some (possibly infinite) collection of $m_i\\geq 1$ and $b_i\\geq 0$ then, if $\\sigma>0$ is such that $\\sum \\frac{1}{m_i^\\sigma}=1$ then, for all large $X$,\\[\\lvert A\\cap [1,X]\\rvert \\ll X^{\\sigma+o(1)}.\\]This result does not help with the given problem since $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{6}=1$.\n\nThis was answered in the negative soon afterwards by Crampin and Hilton (as reported in \\cite{Kl82}), who proved that in fact, for all large $X$,\\[\\lvert A\\cap [1,X]\\rvert \\ll X^{\\tau+o(1)}\\]where $\\tau\\approx 0.900626$ is the unique positive root of\\[6^{-\\tau}+\\sum_{k\\geq 0}(3\\cdot 2^k)^{-\\tau}=1.\\]Their proof is given in \\cite{La16}.\n\nKlarner has several (open) variants of this problem - see Section 8.9 of \\cite{La16}. For example, it is unknown if the smallest set $A$ which contains $0$ and is closed under\\[x\\mapsto 2x,\\]\\[x\\mapsto 3x+2,\\]and\\[x\\mapsto 6x+3\\]has positive density. This problem is repeated by Guy \\cite{Gu83b} in an article called 'Don't Try to Solve These Problems'. This is Problem E36 in Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gu04] Guy, Richard K., Unsolved problems in number theory.
