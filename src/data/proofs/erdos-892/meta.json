  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Sárközy, and Szemerédi (1968) posed the problem of characterizing sequences that can be dominated by primitive sequences. Erdős (1935) showed Σ 1/(aₙ log aₙ) converges for any primitive sequence, giving a necessary condition on b. Erdős–Sárközy–Szemerédi (1967) strengthened this to a reciprocal sum growth condition. The full characterization remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Given b₁ < b₂ < ⋯, find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a primitive sequence a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ (no aᵢ | aⱼ) with aₙ ≪ bₙ.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsPrimitive (no divisibility), IsStrictlyIncreasing, and IsDominatedBy (a ≪ b). ErdosProblem892 asks for existence of a primitive dominator. Necessary conditions from Erdős (1935) and Erdős–Sárközy–Szemerédi (1967) are axiomatized. The GCD-free variant and primitive set counting bounds are also formalized.",
