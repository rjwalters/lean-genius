In fact, for any $a\\geq 2$, if $c=8a^2+8a+1$,\\[\\binom{2a}{a}\\binom{4a+4}{2a+2}\\binom{2c}{c}= \\binom{2a+2}{a+1}\\binom{4a}{2a}\\binom{2c+2}{c+1}.\\]Further families of solutions are given in the comments by SharkyKesa.\n\nThis was earlier asked about in a MathOverflow question, in response to which Elkies also gave an alternative construction which produces solutions - at the moment it is not clear whether Elkies' argument gives infinitely many solutions (although I believe it can).\n\n\n\nBack to the problem",
