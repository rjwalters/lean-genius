  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #397 concerns the central binomial coefficients C(2n, n) = (2n)!/(n!)², which appear throughout combinatorics, probability, and analysis. Erdős asked whether there are only finitely many 'coincidences' where products of distinct central binomial coefficients can be equal.\n\nThe problem remained open for decades until January 2026, when Neel Somani, using ChatGPT as an assistant, discovered an infinite family of solutions. For any a ≥ 2, setting c = 8a² + 8a + 1 yields the identity:\nC(a)·C(2a+2)·C(c) = C(a+1)·C(2a)·C(c+1)\n\nThis remarkable discovery shows that Erdős's intuition about finiteness was wrong—there are infinitely many such 'coincidences' in a beautifully parametrized family.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős)**: Are there only finitely many solutions to\n$$\\prod_i \\binom{2m_i}{m_i} = \\prod_j \\binom{2n_j}{n_j}$$\nwith the $m_i, n_j$ all distinct?\n\n**Answer**: NO — disproved by Somani (2026). There are infinitely many solutions.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the disproof by:\n\n1. **Define the solution set**: Pairs (M, N) of disjoint finite sets where the products of central binomials match\n2. **State the main result**: The solution set is infinite (as an axiom)\n3. **Somani's family**: For a ≥ 2, define c = 8a² + 8a + 1, giving solutions ({a, 2a+2, c}, {a+1, 2a, c+1})\n4. **Verify basic values**: Compute C(0)=1, C(1)=2, C(2)=6, C(3)=20 and c(2)=49\n\nThe identity verification requires careful algebraic manipulation of factorials, which we state as an axiom.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Central binomial coefficients**: C(2n, n) counts lattice paths from (0,0) to (n,n), or ways to balance n left and n right parentheses. They grow like 4ⁿ/√(πn).",
      "**The product structure**: Factoring C(2n, n) = (2n)!/(n!)² reveals multiplicative structure. Two products can match if their prime factorizations align.",
      "**Somani's parametrization**: The key insight is c = 8a² + 8a + 1, which creates a delicate balance making the identity work for all a ≥ 2.",
      "**AI-assisted mathematics**: This is a notable example of human-AI collaboration in mathematics research—Somani used ChatGPT to help find the parametric family.",
      "**Infinitude from parameters**: Since a can be any integer ≥ 2, we get infinitely many distinct solutions, completely disproving the conjecture."
