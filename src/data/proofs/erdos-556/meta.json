    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define edge colorings, cycle graphs, and monochromatic embeddings\n\n2. **Ramsey Number:** Define R_cycle_3(n) as the minimum m with the Ramsey property\n\n3. **Historical Bounds:** Axiomatize Łuczak's asymptotic results (1999)\n\n4. **Exact Bounds:** Axiomatize KSS (2005) for odd cycles, Benevides-Skokan (2009) for even\n\n5. **Small Cases:** R(C_3;3) = 17, R(C_4;3) = 8, R(C_5;3) = 17\n\n6. **Main Theorem:** Combine all results into erdos_556",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #556 asked to prove R(C_n;3) ≤ 4n - 3. The conjecture is PROVED with complete resolution: for large odd n, R(C_n;3) = 4n - 3 exactly (KSS 2005); for large even n, R(C_n;3) = 2n (Benevides-Skokan 2009). The odd/even dichotomy is striking—odd cycles require roughly twice as many vertices!",
    "implications": "**Implications for Ramsey Theory**\n\n1. **Parity Matters:** The odd/even dichotomy shows parity is crucial in cycle Ramsey numbers\n\n2. **Regularity Method Power:** Szemerédi's method provides exact bounds, not just asymptotics\n\n3. **3 Colors vs 2:** 3-coloring requires significantly more vertices than 2-coloring\n\n4. **Tight Bounds Achievable:** Many Ramsey problems have exact answers, not just bounds",
