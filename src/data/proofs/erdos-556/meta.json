Show that\\[R(C_n;3) \\leq 4n-3.\\]\n\n\n\nA problem of Bondy and Erd\\H{o}s. This inequality is best possible for odd $n$.\n\nLuczak \\cite{Lu99} has shown that $R(C_n;3)\\leq (4+o(1))n$ for all $n$, and in fact $R(C_n;3)\\leq 3n+o(n)$ for even $n$.\n\nKohayakawa, Simonovits, and Skokan \\cite{KSS05} proved this conjecture when $n$ is sufficiently large and odd. Benevides and Skokan \\cite{BeSk09} proved that if $n$ is sufficiently large and even then $R(C_n;3)=2n$.\n\nThis problem is #25 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BeSk09] Benevides, Fabricio Siqueira and Skokan, Jozef, The 3-colored Ramsey number of even cycles.
