We call $A$ proportionately dissociated if every finite $B\\subset A$ contains a dissociated set of size $\\gg \\lvert B\\rvert$.\n\nIs every proportionately dissociated set the union of a finite number of dissociated sets?\n\n\n\nThis question appears in a paper of Alon and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{AlEr85}, although the general topic was first considered by Pisier \\cite{Pi83}, who observed that the converse holds, and proved that being proportionately dissociated is equivalent to being a 'Sidon set' in the harmonic analysis sense; that is, whenever $f:A\\to \\mathbb{C}$ there exists some $\\theta\\in [0,1]$ such that\\[\\| f\\|_1 \\ll \\left\\lvert\\sum_{n\\in A} f(n)e(n\\theta)\\right\\rvert,\\]where $e(x)=e^{2\\pi ix}$.\n\nAlon and Erd\\H{o}s write that it 'seems unlikely that [this] is also sufficient'. They also point out the same question can be asked replacing dissociated with Sidon (in the additive combinatorial sense) (see [328]). This latter question was resolved in the negative by Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il, R\\\"{o}dl, and Sales \\cite{NRS24}.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AlEr85] Alon, Noga and Erd\\H{o}s, P., An application of graph theory to additive number theory.
