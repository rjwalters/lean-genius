  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A Sidon set (or B₂ sequence) is a set where all pairwise sums are distinct. Cameron and Erdős (1992) posed counting questions about such sets. This problem asks about A₁(N), the number of maximal Sidon subsets of {1,...,N}. Saxton and Thomason (2015) developed the hypergraph container method and proved tight bounds on the number of Sidon sets, which resolved this problem.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A₁(N) be the number of maximal Sidon subsets of {1,...,N}. Two questions: (1) Is A₁(N) < 2^{o(N^{1/2})}? (2) Is A₁(N) > 2^{N^c} for some constant c > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "Saxton-Thomason (2015) proved that the number of Sidon sets A(N) ≥ 2^{(1.16+o(1))√N}. Since each maximal Sidon set contains ≤ 2^{(1+o(1))√N} Sidon subsets, and every Sidon set is in some maximal one, we get A₁(N) ≥ A(N) / 2^{(1+o(1))√N} ≥ 2^{(0.16+o(1))√N}. This answers Q2: YES. For Q1: the lower bound shows A₁(N) is NOT < 2^{o(√N)}, so Q1: NO.",
