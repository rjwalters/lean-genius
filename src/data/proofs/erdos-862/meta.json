Is it true that\\[A_1(N) < 2^{o(N^{1/2})}?\\]Is it true that\\[A_1(N) > 2^{N^c}\\]for some constant $c>0$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Cameron and Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nThis is resolved as a consequence of results of Saxton and Thomason \\cite{SaTh15} - they prove that there number of Sidon sets in $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ is at least $2^{(1.16+o(1))N^{1/2}}$. Since each Sidon set is contained in a maximal Sidon set, and each maximal Sidon set contains at most $2^{(1+o(1))N^{1/2}}$ Sidon sets, it follows that\\[A_1(N) \\geq 2^{(0.16+o(1))N^{1/2}}.\\]See also [861].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[SaTh15] Saxton, David and Thomason, Andrew, Hypergraph containers.
