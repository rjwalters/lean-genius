  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears as B46 in Guy's 'Unsolved Problems in Number Theory'. It asks about the distribution of primes whose predecessor has a very restricted prime factorization — a power of 2 times a single prime.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many primes p such that p = 2^k · q + 1 for some prime q and k ≥ 0? More generally, p = 2^k · 3^l · q + 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize both variants of the problem, provide small examples, and note the connection to safe primes (k = 1 case) and smooth number theory.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "When k = 1, this asks for infinitely many safe primes p = 2q + 1",
      "The 2^k · q + 1 form is strictly stronger than the 2^k · 3^l · q + 1 form",
      "p − 1 being 2^k · q means p − 1 is '2-smooth times a prime'",
      "Examples: 3, 5, 7, 13, 29, 41, 61, 97, ...",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1065 asks whether primes p = 2^k · q + 1 (and the relaxed 2^k · 3^l · q + 1) occur infinitely often. The special case k = 1 reduces to the safe primes conjecture. Both questions remain open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would illuminate the factorization structure of p − 1 for primes p, connecting to Artin's conjecture and the distribution of smooth numbers.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Are there infinitely many primes p = 2^k · q + 1?",
