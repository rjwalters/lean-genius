    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #831**\n\nThis geometric extremal problem was posed by Erdős in the 1970s and revisited in the 1990s, documented in [Er75h] and [Er92e].\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős asked about the minimum number of distinct circumradii from point configurations\n- Related to classical problems about point-line and point-circle incidences\n- Connects to the unit distance problem and orchard problem\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nGiven n points in general position (no three collinear, no four concyclic), each triple determines a unique circumcircle. The question is: over all such configurations, what is the minimum number of distinct radii among these circles?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet h(n) be maximal such that in any n points in ℝ² (with no three on a line and no four on a circle) there are at least h(n) circles of different radii passing through three of the points. Estimate h(n).\n\n**Formal Statement:**\nh(n) = min_{S in general position, |S|=n} |{circumradius(p₁,p₂,p₃) : p₁,p₂,p₃ ∈ S}|\n\n**Answer: UNKNOWN**\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of h(n) is not determined. Possible behaviors: Θ(n), Θ(n^α), or Θ(n²).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Geometric Foundations:** Define points in ℝ², collinearity, and concyclicity\n\n2. **General Position:** Formalize the constraint \"no 3 collinear, no 4 concyclic\"\n\n3. **Circumradius:** Define using the formula R = abc/(4·Area)\n\n4. **Counting Function:** Define h(n) as the minimum over configurations\n\n5. **Basic Bounds:**\n   - Upper bound: h(n) ≤ C(n,3)\n   - Lower bound: h(4) ≥ 2\n\n6. **Main Conjecture:** Axiomatize the open asymptotic question",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**General Position:** No 3 collinear ensures circumcircles exist; no 4 concyclic prevents radius repetition",
      "**Upper Bound:** At most C(n,3) = n(n-1)(n-2)/6 distinct radii (one per triple)",
      "**h(4) ≥ 2:** If all 4 circumradii were equal, the 4 points would lie on a circle",
      "**Regular Polygons Fail:** Points on a circle violate general position",
      "**Asymptotic Mystery:** Whether h(n) grows like n, n^α, or n² is unknown",
      "**Related to #104 and #506:** Similar extremal flavor as orchard and unit distance problems"
