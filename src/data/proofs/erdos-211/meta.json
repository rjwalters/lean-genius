Given $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, at most $n-k$ on any line, there are $\\gg kn$ many lines which contain at least two points.\n\n\n\nIn particular, given any $2n$ points with at most $n$ on a line there are $\\gg n^2$ many lines formed by the points. Solved by Beck \\cite{Be83} and Szemer\\'{e}di and Trotter \\cite{SzTr83}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er84} Erd\\H{o}s speculates that perhaps there are $\\geq (1+o(1))kn/6$ many such lines, but says 'perhaps [this] is too optimistic and one should first look for a counterexample'. The constant $1/6$ would be best possible here, since there are arrangements of $n$ points with no four points on a line and $\\sim n^2/6$ many lines containing three points (see Burr, Gr\\\"{u}nbaum, and Sloane \\cite{BGS74} and F\\\"{u}redi and Pal\\'{a}sti \\cite{FuPa84}).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BGS74] Burr, Stefan A. and Gr\\\"{u}nbaum, Branko and Sloane, N.
