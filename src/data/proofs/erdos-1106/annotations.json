    "content": "Erdős posed this problem at Oberwolfach in 1986. The partition function p(n) counts how many ways to write n as a sum of positive integers (order doesn't matter). For example, p(4) = 5 because 4 = 4 = 3+1 = 2+2 = 2+1+1 = 1+1+1+1. The problem asks about F(n), which counts distinct prime factors in the product p(1)·p(2)·...·p(n).",
