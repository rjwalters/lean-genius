    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #290 (Harmonic Denominator Drops)**\n\nErdős asked about a curious property of partial harmonic sums: can adding one more term to the sum actually DECREASE the denominator (in lowest terms)?\n\n**The Example:**\n∑_{3≤n≤5} 1/n = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 = 47/60\n∑_{3≤n≤6} 1/n = 47/60 + 1/6 = 19/20\n\nHere 60 > 20, so the denominator DROPPED when we added 1/6!\n\n**van Doorn's Resolution (2024):**\nProved this phenomenon always occurs: for any starting point a, there exists b such that adding 1/(b+1) decreases the denominator.\n\n**Key Bounds:**\n- b(a) < 4.374a (upper)\n- b(a) > a + 0.54 log a (lower)\n- Explicit: if a ∈ (3^k, 3^{k+1}], take b = 2·3^{k+1} - 1",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet a ≥ 1. Must there exist some b > a such that:\n- ∑_{a≤n≤b} 1/n = r₁/s₁ (in lowest terms)\n- ∑_{a≤n≤b+1} 1/n = r₂/s₂ (in lowest terms)\n- s₂ < s₁ (denominator decreases!)\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nvan Doorn (2024) proved:\n1. b(a) always exists\n2. b(a) < 4.374a for all a > 1\n3. b(a) > a + 0.54 log a for large a\n\nSee OEIS A375081 for computed values.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Harmonic Sums:** partialHarmonic(a,b) = ∑_{a≤n≤b} 1/n as a rational\n\n2. **Denominator:** harmonicDenom extracts the reduced denominator\n\n3. **Drop Property:** HasDenominatorDrop(a,b) = denominator decreases at b+1\n\n4. **Question:** ErdosQuestion290 asks if b always exists\n\n5. **van Doorn:** Axiomatize main theorem, bounds, and explicit construction\n\n6. **Examples:** Verify 47/60 → 19/20 computationally",
