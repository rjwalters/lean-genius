    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nGiven $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ the number of distinct unit circles containing at least three points is $o(n^2)$.\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er81d} Erd\\H{o}s proved that $\\gg n$ many circles is possible, and that there cannot be more than $O(n^2)$ many circles. The argument is very simple: every pair of points determines at most $2$ unit circles, and the claimed bound follows from double counting. Erd\\H{o}s claims in a number of places this produces the upper bound $n(n-1)$, but Harborth and Mengerson \\cite{HaMe86} note that in fact this delivers an upper bound of $\\frac{n(n-1)}{3}$.\n\nElekes \\cite{El84} has a simple construction of a set with $\\gg n^{3/2}$ such circles. This may be the correct order of magnitude.\n\nIn \\cite{Er75h} and \\cite{Er92e} Erd\\H{o}s also asks how many such unit circles there must be if the points are in general position.\n\nIn \\cite{Er92e} Erd\\H{o}s offered £100 for a proof or disproof that the answer is $O(n^{3/2})$.\n\nThe maximal number of unit circles achieved by $n$ points is A003829 in the OEIS.\n\nSee also [506] and [831].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[El84] Elekes, G., {$n$} points in the plane can determine $n^{3/2}$ unit\ncircles.
