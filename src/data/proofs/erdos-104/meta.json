  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is a fundamental problem in discrete geometry, related to the unit distance problem. Erdős posed it in 1975 and offered $100 for proving the O(n^{3/2}) bound. The trivial upper bound O(n²) comes from double counting: each pair determines at most 2 unit circles. Elekes (1984) showed the lower bound Ω(n^{3/2}) is achievable, suggesting this might be tight.",
    "problemStatement": "Given n points in ℝ², prove that the number of distinct unit circles containing at least three points is o(n²), or more specifically, O(n^{3/2}).",
    "proofStrategy": "The trivial bound uses double counting: each circle with 3+ points contains at least 3 pairs, each pair lies on at most 2 unit circles, giving ≤ 2·C(n,2)/3 = n(n-1)/3 circles. Proving O(n^{3/2}) likely requires incidence bounds like Szemerédi-Trotter for circles.",
