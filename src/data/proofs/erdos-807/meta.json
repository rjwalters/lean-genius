    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #807: Bipartite Decomposition**\n\nThis problem concerns the relationship between two fundamental graph parameters: the bipartition number and the independence number.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Katona, Recski, Wormald [KRW88]: Original conjecture formulation\n- Graham-Pollak (1971): Classic result that complete graphs need n-1 complete bipartite subgraphs\n- Alon [Al15] (2015): Disproved the conjecture\n- Alon, Bohman, Huang [ABH17] (2017): Strengthened the disproof\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- tau(G) = bipartition number = minimum edge-disjoint complete bipartite subgraphs covering G\n- alpha(G) = independence number = size of largest independent set\n- G(n, 1/2) = Erdos-Renyi random graph with n vertices and edge probability 1/2\n\nThe conjecture asked whether tau(G) = n - alpha(G) almost surely for random graphs. This seemed plausible given connections to the Graham-Pollak theorem.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nThe bipartition number $\\tau(G)$ is the smallest number of pairwise edge-disjoint complete bipartite graphs whose union is $G$. The independence number $\\alpha(G)$ is the size of the largest independent set.\n\n**Conjecture:** For a random graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with edge probability $1/2$, is it true that $\\tau(G) = n - \\alpha(G)$ almost surely?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\nAlon (2015) showed: Almost surely $\\tau(G) \\leq n - \\alpha(G) - 1$.\n\nAlon-Bohman-Huang (2017) proved: There exists $c > 0$ such that almost surely $\\tau(G) \\leq n - (1+c)\\alpha(G)$.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Structures:** Define independence number and bipartition number using SimpleGraph from Mathlib.\n\n2. **Key Definitions:**\n   - CompleteBipartite: structure for complete bipartite subgraphs\n   - BipartiteCover: edge-disjoint collection covering all edges\n   - bipartitionNumber: infimum of cover sizes\n\n3. **Main Results:** Axiomatize Alon's disproof and the Alon-Bohman-Huang improvement.\n\n4. **Why Axioms:** The results require probabilistic analysis of random graphs, concentration inequalities, and sophisticated counting arguments beyond Mathlib's current scope.",
