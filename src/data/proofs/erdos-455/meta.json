  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns sequences of primes where consecutive gaps never decrease. Such sequences must spread out increasingly, but the question is: how fast?\n\nErdős asked whether these sequences must grow superquadratically, i.e., whether lim q_n/n² = ∞. This remains open.\n\nIn 1976, Bernd Richter made progress by proving a lower bound: liminf q_n/n² > 0.352. This shows such sequences must grow at least quadratically, but whether they must grow strictly faster remains unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $q_1 < q_2 < \\cdots$ be a sequence of primes with non-decreasing gaps:\n$$q_{n+1} - q_n \\geq q_n - q_{n-1}$$\n\n**Open Question**: Must $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{q_n}{n^2} = \\infty$?\n\n**Partial Result (Richter 1976)**: $\\liminf_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{q_n}{n^2} > 0.352$",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem using a structure `MonotoneGapPrimeSeq` that captures all the constraints: strict monotonicity, primality of all terms, and non-decreasing gaps.\n\nRichter's lower bound is stated as an axiom since its proof requires careful prime distribution estimates. The main conjecture is formalized as an equivalence: the conjecture holds iff all such sequences have q_n/n² tending to infinity.\n\nWe also prove basic structural properties: gaps are positive, all terms are at least 2, etc.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Non-decreasing gaps are restrictive**: The sequence of all primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...) does NOT satisfy this condition because the gap 13-11=2 is less than 11-7=4.",
      "**Quadratic growth is necessary**: Richter's bound shows q_n ≥ 0.352·n² eventually. The gaps must grow like n to maintain non-decreasing differences.",
      "**The conjecture asks for more**: While quadratic growth is proved, the question is whether strictly superquadratic growth (faster than any cn²) is required.",
      "**Discrete convexity**: The non-decreasing gaps condition is equivalent to discrete convexity - the sequence lies above its secant lines."

    "summary": "This formalization captures the open Erdős Problem #455 about prime sequences with monotonically non-decreasing gaps. While Richter's 1976 result shows such sequences must grow at least quadratically, the question of whether they must grow strictly faster than n² remains open.",
