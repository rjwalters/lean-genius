    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #457, posed by Erdős and Pomerance [Er79d], [ErGr80], asks about small prime divisors of consecutive products. The function q(n,k) = smallest prime not dividing the product of k consecutive integers after n provides an equivalent formulation. A construction shows q(n, log n) >= (2+o(1))log(n). Related to Problem #663.",

    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines consecutiveProduct and smallestNonDividingPrime (q(n,k)). The main conjecture uses Set.Infinite. The equivalent q(n,k) formulation and upper bound sub-question are stated separately.",
