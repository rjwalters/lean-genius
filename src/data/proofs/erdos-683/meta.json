  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Sylvester (1892) and Schur (1929) proved that for k ≤ n/2, the binomial coefficient C(n,k) has a prime divisor exceeding k. Erdős improved this in 1934 and 1955, showing P(C(n,k)) ≫ k log k. In 1979, Erdős conjectured the stronger bound P(C(n,k)) ≥ min(n-k+1, k^{1+c}), which remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nFor every 1 ≤ k ≤ n, is there a constant c > 0 such that:\n  P(C(n,k)) ≥ min(n - k + 1, k^{1+c})\n\nwhere P(m) denotes the largest prime divisor of m?\n\n**Known:**\n- P(C(n,k)) > k for k ≤ n/2 (Sylvester-Schur)\n- P(C(n,k)) ≫ k log k (Erdős 1955)\n\n**Believed:**\n- For any c > 0, P(C(n,k)) > k^{1+c} with finitely many exceptions",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the largest prime divisor function P and applies it to binomial coefficients. The Sylvester-Schur theorem and Erdős's 1955 improvement are axiomatized. The main conjecture is stated but marked as open. Connections to products of consecutive integers and Bertrand's postulate are explored.",
