  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This $44 Erdős problem was solved by Fishburn. Lefmann and Theile (1995) strengthened it to work under the weaker 'no three collinear' condition instead of convexity. Erdős and Fishburn conjectured that the regular n-gon maximizes ∑ f(u)². Related to OEIS sequence A387858.",
    "problemStatement": "Suppose n points in ℝ² form the vertices of a convex polygon. Let f(u) count pairs at distance u. Prove that ∑ f(u)² = O(n³). Note: trivially ∑ f(u) = C(n,2).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize point configurations, distance multiplicities, and the sum of squares. The main theorem (Fishburn) states ∑ f(u)² ≤ C·n³. Lefmann-Theile strengthens this to 'no three collinear'. We also formalize the regular n-gon and the Erdős-Fishburn extremal conjecture.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #94, a $44 problem solved by Fishburn. The bound ∑ f(u)² = O(n³) was proved for convex polygons and strengthened by Lefmann-Theile to 'no three collinear'. The Erdős-Fishburn conjecture that the regular n-gon is extremal remains open.",
    "implications": "This result bounds the 'clustering' of distances in convex configurations. It has connections to distinct distances problems and incidence geometry. The quadruple-counting interpretation links to algebraic techniques.",
