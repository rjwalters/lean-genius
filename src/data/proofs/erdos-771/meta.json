    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #771 (Subsets Avoiding a Given Sum)**\n\n**Origin:**\nErdős and Graham conjectured that f(n) = (1/2+o(1))n/log n, where f(n) is the maximum size of a set S ⊆ {1,...,n} such that for any given m, no nonempty subset of S sums to m.\n\n**The Lower Bound (Erdős-Graham):**\nFor any m, take S = multiples of the smallest prime p not dividing m. Then p < (2+o(1))log n by the prime number theorem, giving |S| ≥ (1/2+o(1))n/log n.\n\n**The Upper Bound (Alon-Freiman 1988):**\nChoose m = lcm{1,...,s} where s is maximal such that m ≤ n²/(20(log n)²). Any S ⊆ {1,...,n} with |S| > (1/2+o(1))n/log n must have a nonempty subset summing to m.\n\n**Result:**\nThe conjecture is TRUE: f(n) = (1/2+o(1))n/log n exactly.",
