    "historicalContext": "Hermite proved e is transcendental in 1873. Lindemann extended this in 1882 to show e^alpha is transcendental for any algebraic alpha != 0. Weierstrass further generalized this to the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem on linear combinations.",
    "problemStatement": "**Hermite-Lindemann Theorem**: If alpha is a non-zero algebraic number, then e^alpha is transcendental.\n\n**Corollaries**:\n- e = e^1 is transcendental (since 1 is algebraic)\n- pi is transcendental (since e^(i*pi) = -1 is algebraic)",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof constructs auxiliary functions using contour integrals. For a polynomial with algebraic roots, a careful integral estimate shows that a certain expression is both a non-zero integer and arbitrarily small, a contradiction.",
