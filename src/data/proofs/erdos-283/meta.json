  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #283 connects two classical topics: Egyptian fractions (sums of distinct unit fractions, used by ancient Egyptians) and additive representation of integers by polynomial values.\n\nThe problem asks: given a polynomial p with positive leading coefficient and no universal divisor (no d ≥ 2 dividing all p(n)), can every sufficiently large m be written as p(n₁) + ... + p(nₖ) where additionally 1/n₁ + ... + 1/nₖ = 1?\n\nGraham (1963) proved this for p(x) = x, showing that for large enough m, there exist distinct positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1 and whose values sum to m. Alekseyev (2019) extended this to p(x) = x², proving it for all m > 8542. van Doorn (2025) extended to many linear and quadratic polynomials.\n\nThe general case remains open. The Egyptian fraction constraint is crucial: without it, Cassels (1960) showed the representation is always possible under the polynomial conditions.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $p: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ be a polynomial with positive leading coefficient, and suppose there is no $d \\geq 2$ dividing $p(n)$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nIs it true that for all sufficiently large $m$, there exist distinct positive integers $n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots < n_k$ such that:\n$$\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n_k} = 1$$\nand\n$$p(n_1) + p(n_2) + \\cdots + p(n_k) = m$$\n\n**Status**: PARTIALLY SOLVED\n- $p(x) = x$: YES (Graham 1963)\n- $p(x) = x^2$: YES for $m > 8542$ (Alekseyev 2019)\n- General polynomial: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining:\n\n1. **IsEgyptianDecomposition**: A finite set of positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1\n2. **HasNoUniversalDivisor**: The polynomial condition (no d ≥ 2 dividing all values)\n3. **ErdosCondition**: The main property that for sufficiently large m, such decompositions exist\n\nWe prove structural theorems (X and X² have no universal divisor) and verify concrete examples. The main results by Graham and Alekseyev are stated as axioms since their proofs require detailed combinatorial arguments not in Mathlib.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Egyptian fractions are ancient**: The Egyptians represented all fractions as sums of distinct unit fractions. There are infinitely many ways to write 1 as such a sum: {1}, {2,3,6}, {2,4,6,12}, etc.",
      "**The two constraints interact**: We need integers whose reciprocals sum to 1 AND whose polynomial values sum to m. This severely restricts which sets we can use.",
      "**Universal divisor condition**: If d | p(n) for all n, then only m divisible by d can be represented. The condition rules this out.",
      "**Alekseyev's example**: 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 = 1 and 2² + 4² + 6² + 12² = 200. This shows 200 is achievable for squares.",
      "**The gap to general polynomials**: While linear and quadratic cases are solved, higher degrees remain open. The difficulty grows with polynomial complexity."

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #283, which asks whether polynomial values can represent all large integers subject to an Egyptian fraction constraint. The problem is solved for p(x) = x (Graham 1963) and p(x) = x² (Alekseyev 2019), but remains open for general polynomials.",
    "implications": "This problem connects:\n\n1. **Egyptian fractions**: An ancient representation system still yielding open problems\n2. **Additive number theory**: Representing integers as sums of special sequences\n3. **Polynomial arithmetic**: How polynomial structure affects representability\n\nThe Egyptian fraction constraint makes the problem much harder than plain additive representation (solved by Cassels).",
