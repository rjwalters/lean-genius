    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $p:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z}$ be a polynomial whose leading coefficient is positive and such that there exists no $d\\geq 2$ with $d\\mid p(n)$ for all $n\\geq 1$. Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $m$, there exist integers $1\\leq n_1<\\cdots <n_k$ such that\\[1=\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n_k}\\]and\\[m=p(n_1)+\\cdots+p(n_k)?\\]\n\n\n\nGraham \\cite{Gr63} has proved this when $p(x)=x$. Graham also conjectures that this remains true with $1$ replaced by an arbitrary rational $\\alpha>0$ (provided $m$ is taken sufficiently large depending on $\\alpha$).\n\nCassels \\cite{Ca60} has proved that these conditions on the polynomial imply every sufficiently large integer is the sum of $p(n_i)$ with distinct $n_i$. Burr has proved this if $p(x)=x^k$ with $k\\geq 1$ and if we allow $n_i=n_j$.\n\nAlekseyev \\cite{Al19} has proved this when $p(x)=x^2$, for all $m>8542$. For example,\\[1=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{6}+\\frac{1}{12}\\]and\\[200 = 2^2+4^2+6^2+12^2.\\]van Doorn \\cite{vD25} has investigated the question of what 'sufficiently large' means for $p(x)=x$. van Doorn has also proved the original conjecture for many linear and quadratic polynomials, for example $p(x)=x+5$ or $p(x)=x^2+100$ - see the comments section.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al19] Alekseyev, Max A., On partitions into squares of distinct integers whose\nreciprocals sum to 1.
