    "content": "**Erdős Problem #283** asks a beautiful question connecting two ancient mathematical ideas: Egyptian fractions (sums of unit fractions like 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6 = 1) and representing integers by polynomial values. The problem: if p(x) is a polynomial with positive leading coefficient and no universal divisor, can every large m be written as p(n₁) + ... + p(nₖ) where additionally 1/n₁ + ... + 1/nₖ = 1?",

    "content": "**IsEgyptianDecomposition** captures the key constraint: a finite set s of positive integers whose reciprocals sum exactly to 1.
