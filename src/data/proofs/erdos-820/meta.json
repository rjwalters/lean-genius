(That is, $(2^n-1,3^n-1)=1$ infinitely often?)\n\nEstimate $H(n)$. Is it true that there exists some constant $c>0$ such that, for all $\\epsilon>0$,\\[H(n) > \\exp(n^{(c-\\epsilon)/\\log\\log n})\\]for infinitely many $n$ and\\[H(n) < \\exp(n^{(c+\\epsilon)/\\log\\log n})\\]for all large enough $n$?\n\nDoes a similar upper bound hold for the smallest $k$ such that $(k^n-1,2^n-1)=1$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er74b} proved that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that\\[H(n) > \\exp(n^{c/(\\log\\log n)^2})\\]for infinitely many $n$.\n\nvan Doorn in the comments sketches a proof of the lower bound: that there exists some constant $c>0$ and infinitely many $n$ such that\\[H(n) > \\exp(n^{c/\\log\\log n}).\\]The sequence $H(n)$ for $1\\leq n\\leq 10$ is\\[3,3,3,6,3,18,3,6,3,12.\\]The sequence of $n$ for which $(2^n-1,3^n-1)=1$ is A263647 in the OEIS.\n\nSee also [770].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er74b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Remarks on some problems in number theory.
