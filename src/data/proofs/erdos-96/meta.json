    "historicalContext": "**Unit Distances in Convex Position**\n\nHow many pairs of vertices in a convex n-gon can be at the same distance (say, distance 1)? Unlike the general unit distance problem, convexity should severely restrict repeated distances.\n\n**The Conjecture**: Erdős and Moser conjectured that the answer is O(n). The stronger form (Erdős-Fishburn) claims the maximum is exactly 2n.\n\n**Progress on Upper Bounds**:\n- Füredi (1990): O(n log n)\n- Brass-Pach (2001): Simplified proof of O(n log n)\n- Aggarwal (2015): n log₂n + 4n (current best)\n\n**Lower Bound Construction**: Edelsbrunner and Hajnal (1991) constructed convex n-gons with 2n-7 unit distance pairs, disproving an earlier conjecture of 5n/3 + O(1).\n\n**The Gap**: Between 2n-7 (achievable) and n log n (upper bound). Closing this gap to prove O(n) remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIf n points in ℝ² form a convex polygon, prove there are O(n) pairs at distance 1 apart.\n\n**Stronger Conjecture (Erdős-Fishburn)**: The maximum is exactly 2n.\n\n**Current Bounds**:\n- Upper: n log₂n + 4n (Aggarwal 2015)\n- Lower: 2n - 7 (Edelsbrunner-Hajnal 1991)\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Related Conjecture**: Let g(x) count points equidistant from x in the set A. Erdős conjectured ∑_{x∈A} g(x) < 4n. The Edelsbrunner-Hajnal construction shows ∑g(x) > 4n - O(1) is possible.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approaches and Partial Results**\n\n**Füredi's O(n log n) Bound (1990)**:\n1. Use properties of convex curves\n2. A unit circle can intersect a convex n-gon boundary in at most 2 arcs\n3. Counting argument via forbidden subconfigurations\n\n**Aggarwal's Improvement (2015)**:\n1. More careful analysis of the Füredi approach\n2. Improved constants in the counting argument\n3. Achieved n log₂n + 4n\n\n**Why O(n) is Hard**:\n- The log factor comes from nested distance relationships\n- Convexity constraints are difficult to fully exploit\n- The problem relates to #97 (general equidistant pairs in convex position)\n\n**Edelsbrunner-Hajnal Construction**:\n- Carefully placed points on a circle\n- Achieves 2n-7 unit distances\n- Suggests 2n might be the true answer",
