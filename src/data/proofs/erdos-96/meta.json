In \\cite{Er92e} Erd\\H{o}s credits the conjecture that the true upper bound is $2n$ to himself and Fishburn. F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{Fu90} proved an upper bound of $O(n\\log n)$. A short proof of this bound was given by Brass and Pach \\cite{BrPa01}. The best known upper bound is\\[\\leq n\\log_2n+4n,\\]due to Aggarwal \\cite{Ag15}.\n\nEdelsbrunner and Hajnal \\cite{EdHa91} have constructed $n$ such points with $2n-7$ pairs distance $1$ apart. (This disproved an early stronger conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s and Moser, that the true answer was $\\frac{5}{3}n+O(1)$.)\n\nA positive answer would follow from [97]. See also [90].\n\nIn \\cite{Er92e} Erd\\H{o}s makes the stronger conjecture that, if $g(x)$ counts the largest number of points equidistant from $x$ in $A$, then\\[\\sum_{x\\in A}g(x)< 4n.\\]He notes that the example of Edelsbrunner and Hajnal shows that $\\sum_{x\\in A}g(x)>4n-O(1)$ is possible.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ag15] Aggarwal, Amol, On unit distances in a convex polygon.
