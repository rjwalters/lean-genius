    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Moser conjectured that a convex n-gon has O(n) unit distance pairs. Despite progress from O(n log n) bounds, the conjecture remains open. The gap between the O(n log n) upper bound and the 2n-7 lower bound is the main challenge.",
    "problemStatement": "If n points in ℝ² form a convex polygon, prove there are O(n) pairs at distance 1 apart.",
