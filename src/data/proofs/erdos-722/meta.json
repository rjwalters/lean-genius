  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Steiner systems are fundamental objects in combinatorial design theory. The existence question was progressively solved: Kirkman (1847) for S(2,3,n), Hanani (1961) for several cases, Wilson (1972) for all S(2,k,n), and finally Keevash (2014) for the general case S(r,k,n). Keevash's breakthrough used a novel 'randomized algebraic construction' combining probabilistic and algebraic methods.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet k > r and n be sufficiently large. Does there always exist a Steiner system S(r,k,n) when the divisibility conditions are satisfied?\n\n**Divisibility Conditions:** For 0 ≤ i < r:\n  binom(k-i, r-i) | binom(n-i, r-i)\n\n**Answer:** YES (Keevash 2014)\n\nA Steiner system S(r,k,n) is a collection of k-subsets (blocks) such that every r-subset appears in exactly one block.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Steiner systems as structures with blocks satisfying size and coverage properties. Divisibility conditions are formalized. Historical results (Kirkman, Hanani, Wilson) are axiomatized, and Keevash's theorem gives the general solution. Small examples verify divisibility for S(2,3,7) and S(2,3,9).",
