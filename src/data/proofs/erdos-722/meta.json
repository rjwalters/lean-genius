Does there always exist a block $r-(n,k,1)$ design (or Steiner system with parameters $(n,k,r)$), provided the trivial necessary divisibility conditions $\\binom{k-i}{r-i}\\mid \\binom{n-i}{r-i}$ are satisfied for every $0\\leq i<r$?\n\nThat is, can one find a family of $\\binom{n}{k}\\binom{k}{r}^{-1}$ many subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, all of size $k$, such that any $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ of size $r$ is contained in exactly one set in the family?\n\n\n\nThis was proved for $(r,k)$ by:\n{UL}\n{LI}Kirkman for $(2,3)$;{/LI}\n{LI}Hanani \\cite{Ha61} for $(3,4)$, $(2,4)$, and $(2,5)$;{/LI}\n{LI}Wilson \\cite{Wi72} for $(2,k)$ for any $k$;{/LI}\n{LI}Keevash \\cite{Ke14} for all $(r,k)$.\n{/UL}\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ha61] Hanani, Haim, The existence and construction of balanced incomplete block\ndesigns.
