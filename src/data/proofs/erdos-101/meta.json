  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem across several papers from 1984 to 1997. He originally conjectured the answer is Θ(n^{3/2}), but Solymosi and Stojaković disproved this with nearly quadratic constructions. The o(n²) upper bound remains the central open question.",
    "problemStatement": "Given n points in ℝ² with no five collinear, prove that the number of lines containing exactly four of the points is o(n²).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the point-set configuration, the no-five-collinear condition, and the four-point line count. The main conjecture, known lower bounds, and connections to incidence geometry are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "No five collinear is the natural threshold: with five allowed, trivially Ω(n²) four-point lines",
      "Grünbaum's construction gives ≫ n^{3/2} four-point lines",
      "Solymosi–Stojaković achieve n^{2−O(1/√log n)}, nearly quadratic",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #101 asks whether four-point lines from n points (no five collinear) are o(n²). The Θ(n^{3/2}) conjecture was disproved by Solymosi–Stojaković, but the o(n²) bound remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would advance our understanding of collinearity patterns in discrete geometry and connect to Szemerédi–Trotter-type incidence bounds.",

      "Is the four-point line count o(n²)?",
