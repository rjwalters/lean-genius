    "historicalContext": "**Planarity and Density**\n\nPlanar graphs - those embeddable in the plane without edge crossings - have at most 3n - 6 edges by Euler's formula. This is linear in n. What happens when we have more edges?\n\n**The Question**: For super-linear edge counts n^(1+ε), Erdős asked whether non-planarity must appear in a 'small' subgraph. The constant C_ε should depend only on ε, not on n.\n\n**Kuratowski's Theorem**: A graph is non-planar iff it contains a subdivision of K₅ or K₃,₃. So finding non-planarity means finding these obstructions.\n\n**Resolution**: Kostochka and Pyber (1988) proved that dense graphs contain K₅ subdivisions on O_ε(1) vertices, completely answering Erdős's question.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet ε > 0. Is there a constant C_ε such that, for all large n, every graph on n vertices with at least n^(1+ε) edges must contain a non-planar subgraph on at most C_ε vertices?\n\n**Status**: SOLVED (Kostochka-Pyber 1988)\n\n**Answer**: YES. Dense graphs contain K₅ subdivisions with O_ε(1) vertices.\n\n**Note**: Erdős observed C_ε → ∞ as ε → 0 (sparser graphs hide non-planarity in larger structures).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof Approach (Kostochka-Pyber)**\n\n1. **Density Threshold**: Graphs with n^(1+ε) edges are 'super-linearly dense'.\n\n2. **Finding Structure**: Use probabilistic or extremal methods to find vertices of high degree.\n\n3. **K₅ Subdivision**: High-degree vertices connect through short paths, forming a K₅ subdivision.\n\n4. **Bounding Size**: The total vertices used (5 branch vertices + path vertices) is O_ε(1).\n\n**Key Insight**: Super-linear edge density forces enough local structure that K₅ subdivisions must appear in bounded-size subgraphs.",
