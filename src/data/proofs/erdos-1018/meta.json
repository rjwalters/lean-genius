Is there a constant $C_\\epsilon$ such that, for all large $n$, every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n^{1+\\epsilon}$ edges must contain a subgraph on at most $C_\\epsilon$ vertices which is non-planar?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er71} writes it is 'not difficult to see' that $C_\\epsilon\\to \\infty$ as $\\epsilon\\to 0$.\n\nThis was solved in the affirmative by Kostochka and Pyber \\cite{KoPy88}, who proved that $G$ must contain a subdivision of $K_5$ (which is non-planar) with $O_\\epsilon(1)$ many vertices.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er71] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis.
