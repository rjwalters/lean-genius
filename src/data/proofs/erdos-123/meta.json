  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A set A of natural numbers is **d-complete** if every sufficiently large integer is the sum of distinct elements of A such that no element divides another. Erdős originally posed this as a 'nice and difficult' problem in 1992.\n\nThe case {2^k · 3^l} was quickly proved by Jansen and others using a simple inductive argument. Erdős and Lewin (1996) proved the case {3^i · 5^j · 7^k}. The general conjecture for arbitrary pairwise coprime a, b, c remains OPEN.",
    "problemStatement": "Let a, b, c be three pairwise coprime integers > 1. Is the set {a^i · b^j · c^k : i, j, k ≥ 0} d-complete?\n\n**Status**: OPEN in general. Specific cases like {2^k · 3^l} and {3^i · 5^j · 7^k} are SOLVED.",
    "proofStrategy": "For the {2^k · 3^l} case, the proof uses strong induction:\n1. If n is even: apply IH to n/2, double all summands (2^k·3^l → 2^{k+1}·3^l)\n2. If n is odd: subtract largest 3^k ≤ n, apply IH to even remainder\n\nThe antichain property is preserved because:\n- Doubling preserves non-divisibility (a|b ⟺ 2a|2b)\n- Powers of 3 are odd, so they can't divide/be divided by even numbers",
