    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian (1958) posed this question about lemniscates - the sublevel sets of polynomial magnitude. They conjectured both diameter ≤ 2 and width ≤ 2. Pommerenke (1959) proved the disc containment (answering YES) but showed the width conjecture is FALSE.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f ∈ ℂ[x] be a monic polynomial and E = {z : |f(z)| < 1}. If E is connected, is E contained in a disc of radius 2?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sublevel sets, open/closed discs, and root centroids. Pommerenke's theorem is axiomatized: if E is connected, then E ⊆ D(centroid, 2). The width counterexample is also formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The answer is YES - E is contained in a disc of radius 2",
      "The center of this disc can be the root centroid (z₁+...+zₙ)/n",
      "E is connected ⟺ E contains all zeros of f'",
      "The width conjecture is FALSE: width can exceed √3·2^{1/3} ≈ 2.18",
      "The diameter is at most 2 (sharper than the 4 implied by disc containment)"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1046 is SOLVED: YES, if E = {z : |f(z)| < 1} is connected, then E is contained in a disc of radius 2 centered at the root centroid. However, the related width conjecture is FALSE (Pommerenke's counterexample).",
