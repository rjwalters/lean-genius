Conjectured by Erdős and Graham, who also ask about a density-type version: for example, is\\[\\sum_{\\substack{a\\in A\\\\ a>N}}\\frac{1}{a}\\gg \\log N\\]a sufficient condition for $A$ to contain the moduli of a covering system? The answer (to both colouring and density versions) is no, due to the result of Hough [Ho15] on the minimum size of a modulus in a covering system - in particular one could colour all integers $ View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 December 2025.",
