  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Paul Erdős in 1961 [Er61] and remains one of the fundamental open questions in Ramsey theory. The multicolor Ramsey number R(3;k) generalizes the classical two-color Ramsey number R(3,3) = 6, which asks for the minimum n such that any 2-coloring of K_n's edges contains a monochromatic triangle.\n\nThe problem connects to several areas of combinatorics. The upper bound R(3;k) ≤ ⌈e·k!⌉ follows from a clever pigeonhole argument, while lower bounds come from connections to Schur numbers. A major breakthrough came in 2021 when Ageron, Casteras, Pellerin, Portella, Rimmel, and Tomasik [ACPPRT21] improved the lower bound to R(3;k) ≥ 380^{k/5} - O(1).\n\nErdős offered $250 for solving this problem, with an additional $100 specifically for proving that the limit is finite. The gap between known bounds is enormous: R(3;k) lies between roughly 3.28^k and k!, making this one of the most intriguing open problems in Ramsey theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $R(3;k)$ denote the minimum $n$ such that any $k$-coloring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ must contain a monochromatic triangle. Determine:\n\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} R(3;k)^{1/k}$$\n\n**Known bounds:**\n- Upper: $R(3;k) \\leq \\lceil e \\cdot k! \\rceil$\n- Lower: $R(3;k) \\geq 380^{k/5} - O(1)$\n\n**Reward:** $250 (plus $100 for proving the limit is finite)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines R(3;k) as the minimum n forcing a monochromatic triangle in any k-coloring of K_n. We establish the existence of R(3;k) through an axiom (finiteness follows from the pigeonhole upper bound). The known small values R(3;1)=3, R(3;2)=6, R(3;3)=17 are axiomatized.\n\nThe upper bound uses the inductive relation R(3;k) ≤ 2 + k(R(3;k-1)-1), which unfolds to the factorial bound. The lower bound leverages connections to Schur numbers and the 2021 construction achieving 380^{k/5}.\n\nThe main question is formulated as Filter.Tendsto (fun k => R(3;k)^{1/k}) atTop (nhds L) for some limit L, or alternatively whether this tends to infinity.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Multicolor Generalization**: R(3;k) extends the classical R(3,3)=6 to k colors, asking when monochromatic triangles are unavoidable",
      "**Enormous Gap**: Known bounds span from exponential (3.28^k) to factorial (k!), leaving vast uncertainty about the true growth rate",
      "**Schur Connection**: Lower bounds come from Schur numbers S(k), where R(3;k) ≥ S(k) + 2, linking sum-free colorings to triangle-free colorings",
      "**Pigeonhole Upper Bound**: The relation R(3;k) ≤ 2 + k(R(3;k-1)-1) follows from considering color classes at a vertex",
      "**Open Questions**: Both whether the limit exists and whether it is finite remain unknown, each worth separate rewards"
