    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Hajnal (1968) studied covering properties of functions on power sets. The problem asks how large a subset Y must be to guarantee that the image {f(A) : A ⊆ Y} covers the entire set X.",
    "problemStatement": "Let X be a finite set of size n and H(n) be the minimum integer such that there exists f: P(X) -> X where for every Y ⊆ X with |Y| >= H(n), we have {f(A) : A ⊆ Y} = X. Prove that H(n) - log_2(n) -> infinity.",
    "proofStrategy": "The lower bound log_2(n) <= H(n) follows from counting: 2^H subsets can produce at most 2^H distinct images. The upper bound uses probabilistic constructions. The gap H(n) - log_2(n) -> infinity remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Lower bound: 2^H >= n since {f(A) : A ⊆ Y} must equal X",
      "Upper bound: Erdős-Hajnal achieved H < log_2(n) + 3*log_2(log_2(n))",
      "Alon showed no function achieves perfect covering",
      "Even H(2^k) >= k+1 is open"
