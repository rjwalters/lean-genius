    "historicalContext": "A clique transversal is a set of vertices that 'hits' every maximal clique — containing at least one vertex from each. The clique transversal number τ(G) is the minimum size of such a set.\n\nErdős, Gallai, and Tuza proved that τ(G) ≤ n - √(2n) + O(1) for any n-vertex graph. The question is whether this can be improved. The connection to triangle-free graphs is deep: if f(n) is the guaranteed independence number in triangle-free graphs, they conjecture τ(G) ≤ n - f(n).\n\nKim proved f(n) = Θ(√(n log n)), so resolving this conjecture would answer Question 2.",
