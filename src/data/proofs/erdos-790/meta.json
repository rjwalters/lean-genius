    "historicalContext": "**Origins and History**\n\nThis problem appeared in Erdős's 1965 survey \"Extremal problems in number theory\" where he claimed to have a complicated proof that l(n) = o(n). However, by 1973 he reported \"difficulties in reconstructing [his] proof.\"\n\n**Choi-Komlós-Szemerédi Breakthrough (1975)**\n\nThe definitive paper appeared in Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (1975). They proved both:\n- Lower bound: l(n) ≥ c√(n log n / log log n)\n- Upper bound: l(n) ≤ C n / log n\n\nThey conjectured l(n) ≥ n^{1-o(1)}, which remains open.\n\n**Connection to Sum-Free Sets**\n\nThis is a weaker notion than classical sum-free (no a + b = c). Here we forbid a = a₂ + ... + aᵣ for any r ≥ 2 distinct elements. The weaker condition means more sets are \"sum-free\" in this sense.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet l(n) be maximal such that for any A ⊆ ℤ with |A| = n, there exists a sum-free B ⊆ A with |B| ≥ l(n).\n\nHere \"sum-free\" means: no element equals a sum of ≥2 distinct other elements.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Estimate l(n)\n2. Does l(n)/√n → ∞? (YES)\n3. Is l(n) < n^{1-c} for some c > 0? (YES: l(n) ≤ n/log n)\n\n**Status: OPEN** - The gap between √(n log n / log log n) and n/log n remains.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Sum-Free Definition:** IsSumFree forbids a = Σ_{i∈S} aᵢ for S ⊆ B\\{a} with |S| ≥ 2\n\n2. **Extremal Function:** l(n) characterized by l_characterization and l_optimal axioms\n\n3. **Lower Bounds:** Erdős (√(n/2)), Choi ((1+c)√n), CKS (√(n log n / log log n))\n\n4. **Upper Bound:** CKS (n / log n)\n\n5. **Main Questions:** Both answered affirmatively by CKS bounds\n\n6. **Conjecture:** l(n) ≥ n^{1-o(1)} remains open",

      "**Both questions answered:** CKS bounds answer Questions 1 and 2",
      "**Conjecture:** l(n) ≥ n^{1-o(1)} would close the gap (nearly linear)",
