  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Selfridge developed this recursive classification of primes based on the factorization of p+1. The classification reveals a hierarchy: class 1 primes have 3-smooth successors, and each higher class requires deeper factorization structure. The problem appears as A18 in Guy's Unsolved Problems in Number Theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many primes in each class? If p_r is the least prime in class r, how does p_r^{1/r} behave as r → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the recursive prime classification, axiomatize known values of p_r from OEIS A005113, state the infinitude conjecture, and present the competing Erdős (p_r^{1/r} → ∞) and Selfridge (bounded) conjectures about growth.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Class 1 primes have 3-smooth successors: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 23, ...",
      "Known least primes: p_1=2, p_2=13, p_3=37, p_4=73, p_5=1021 (OEIS A005113)",
      "The density of class-r primes is at most n^{o(1)} — extremely sparse",
      "Erdős and Selfridge made contradictory conjectures about p_r^{1/r}",
      "The p+1 variant connects to smooth number theory and Cunningham chains"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1055 asks whether each class in the Erdős–Selfridge prime classification contains infinitely many primes, and how the least prime p_r grows with class r. The known sequence p_1=2, p_2=13, p_3=37, p_4=73, p_5=1021 gives ambiguous evidence: Erdős conjectured superexponential growth while Selfridge conjectured bounded p_r^{1/r}.",
