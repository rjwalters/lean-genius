    "historicalContext": "Oppenheim (1929) conjectured that indefinite irrational quadratic forms in n ≥ 3 variables take values arbitrarily close to zero at integer points. Davenport–Heilbronn (1946) proved the case n ≥ 5 using the circle method. Margulis (1987) proved the full conjecture for n ≥ 3 using the theory of unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces, a landmark application of ergodic theory to number theory.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the ternary quadratic form, the approximation problem, Margulis's theorem, the orbit dichotomy (rational vs. dense), Davenport–Heilbronn for 5 variables, and the Eskin–Margulis–Mozes quantitative refinement.",
