Is the diameter of $A$ $\\gg n$?\n\n\n\nPerhaps the diameter is even $\\geq n-1$ for sufficiently large $n$. Piepmeyer has an example of $9$ such points with diameter $<5$. Kanold proved the diameter is $\\geq n^{3/4}$. The bounds on the distinct distance problem [89] proved by Guth and Katz \\cite{GuKa15} imply a lower bound of $\\gg n/\\log n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GuKa15] Guth, Larry and Katz, Nets Hawk, On the Erd\\H{o}s distinct distances problem in the plane.
