  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in the 1990s as part of his extensive work on distance problems in discrete geometry. The problem connects to Erdős #89 (distinct distances problem), which was famously solved by Guth and Katz in 2015. Piepmeyer's construction of 9 points with diameter < 5 shows the conjectured bound cannot be too strong.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be a set of n points in ℝ² such that all pairwise distances are at least 1 and any two distinct distances differ by at least 1. Is the diameter of A ≫ n?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the restricted distance property, diameter, and the known bounds. Key results include Kanold's n^(3/4) bound, the Guth-Katz n/log n bound (via distinct distances), and Piepmeyer's counterexample to diameter ≥ n-1.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Distances are forced to be positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ...",
      "Kanold: diameter ≥ n^(3/4)",
      "Guth-Katz: distinct distances ≫ n/log n implies diameter ≫ n/log n",
      "Piepmeyer: 9 points with diameter < 5 (counterexample to n-1)",
      "Conjecture: diameter ≥ n-1 may hold for large n"
