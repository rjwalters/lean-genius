  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Kummer's Theorem (1852)** connects binomial coefficient divisibility to digit carries: the exact power of prime p dividing C(m,k) equals the number of carries when adding k + (m-k) in base p.\n\n**EGRS Theorem (1975)**: Erdős, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus proved that for any two odd primes p and q, infinitely many n have C(2n,n) coprime to pq.\n\n**The Open Case**: The question for THREE primes (105 = 3 × 5 × 7) remains **OPEN**.\n\n**Connection to Digits**: C(2n,n) coprime to p iff n has only 'small' digits (0, 1, ..., (p-1)/2) in base p. For 105, this means simultaneously:\n- Only digits {0,1} in base 3\n- Only digits {0,1,2} in base 5\n- Only digits {0,1,2,3} in base 7",
    "problemStatement": "Define the **central binomial coefficient** $C(2n,n) = \\binom{2n}{n}$.\n\n**Definition**: An integer $n$ is **105-good** if $\\gcd(C(2n,n), 105) = 1$.\n\n**Erdős Problem #376 (OPEN)**: Is the set of 105-good integers infinite?\n\n**Known Results**:\n- Two primes: SOLVED by EGRS (1975)\n- Three primes (105 = 3×5×7): **OPEN**\n\n**Equivalently**: Is $\\{n : n \\text{ has restricted digits in bases 3, 5, and 7}\\}$ infinite?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Core definitions**: Is105Good, GoodSet105 using Nat.centralBinom and Nat.Coprime\n\n2. **Kummer's Theorem**: Axiomatize the connection between coprimality and digit representations\n\n3. **EGRS Theorem**: Axiomatize the two-prime result\n\n4. **Corollaries**: Prove infinitely many n coprime to 15, 21, 35 using EGRS\n\n5. **Digit characterization**: Define Base3Good, Base5Good, Base7Good\n\n6. **Computational verification**: Use native_decide for small cases",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Kummer's Theorem key**: C(2n,n) coprime to p iff no carries when computing n + n in base p, i.e., all digits ≤ (p-1)/2.",
      "**Two primes solved**: EGRS construction works for any pq (odd primes). The three-prime case is fundamentally harder.",
      "**Digit intersection**: 105-good ≡ Base3Good ∩ Base5Good ∩ Base7Good. Each individual set is infinite, but intersection may be finite.",
      "**Small cases**: n = 1 is 105-good (C(2,1) = 2). n = 2 fails (C(4,2) = 6 divisible by 3). n = 4 fails (C(8,4) = 70 divisible by 5 and 7).",
      "**Why three primes is harder**: More constraints must be satisfied simultaneously. The digit sets become increasingly sparse."
