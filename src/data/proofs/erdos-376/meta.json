In other words, for all $\\epsilon>0$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $\\binom{2n}{n}$ is coprime to $p_1p_2p_3$, except for a factor of size $\\leq n^\\epsilon$.\n\nThis is mentioned in problem B33 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}. It is also discussed in an article of Pomerance \\cite{Po15c}.\n\nGraham offered \\$1000 for a solution to this problem (as mentioned in \\cite{Gu04} and \\cite{BeHa98}).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BeHa98] Berend, Daniel and Harmse, J\\o rgen E., On some arithmetical properties of middle binomial\ncoefficients.
