  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Quadratic reciprocity is one of the most celebrated theorems in number theory:\n\n- **Euler & Legendre**: Conjectured the result but could not prove it completely\n- **Gauss (1796)**: First complete proof at age 19, calling it the 'golden theorem'\n- **Gauss's obsession**: Published 8 different proofs during his lifetime\n- **Modern significance**: Foundation for class field theory and algebraic number theory\n\nThe theorem reveals deep connections between prime numbers that were completely unexpected.",
    "problemStatement": "**The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity**:\n\nFor distinct odd primes $p$ and $q$:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{q-1}{2}}$$\n\nwhere $(p/q)$ is the Legendre symbol:\n- $1$ if $p$ is a quadratic residue mod $q$\n- $-1$ if $p$ is a quadratic nonresidue mod $q$\n\n**Restated**: The symbols $(p/q)$ and $(q/p)$ are equal unless both $p \\equiv 3$ and $q \\equiv 3$ (mod 4), in which case they are negatives.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses properties of the multiplicative group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^*$:\n\n1. **Legendre symbol definition**: $(a/p) = a^{(p-1)/2} \\mod p$ by Euler's criterion\n\n2. **Counting lattice points**: Gauss's original proof counts lattice points in specific regions\n\n3. **Modern approach**: Uses the structure of finite fields and character theory\n\n4. **Supplementary laws**:\n   - First: $-1$ is a QR mod $p$ iff $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n   - Second: $2$ is a QR mod $p$ iff $p \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{8}$",
