    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $\\phi(n)$ be the Euler totient function and $\\phi_k(n)$ be the iterated $\\phi$ function, so that $\\phi_1(n)=\\phi(n)$ and $\\phi_k(n)=\\phi(\\phi_{k-1}(n))$. Let\\[f(n) = \\min \\{ k : \\phi_k(n)=1\\}.\\]Does $f(n)/\\log n$ have a distribution function? Is $f(n)/\\log n$ almost always constant? What can be said about the largest prime factor of $\\phi_k(n)$ when, say, $k=\\log\\log n$?\n\n\n\nPillai \\cite{Pi29} was the first to investigate this function, and proved\\[\\log_3 n < f(n) < \\log_2 n\\]for all large $n$. Shapiro \\cite{Sh50} proved that $f(n)$ is essentially multiplicative.\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro \\cite{EGPS90} have proved that the answer to the first two questions is yes, conditional on a form of the Elliott-Halberstam conjecture.\n\nIt is likely true that, if $k\\to \\infty$ however slowly with $n$, then for almost all $n$ the largest prime factor of $\\phi_k(n)$ is $\\leq n^{o(1)}$.\n\nThis is discussed in problem B41 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGPS90] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Granville, A. and Pomerance, C. and Spiro, C., On the normal behavior of the iterates of some arithmetic functions.
