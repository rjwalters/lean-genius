  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #495 is the Littlewood conjecture (c. 1930), one of the most famous open problems in Diophantine approximation. It asks whether every pair of reals can be simultaneously well-approximated by rationals in a multiplicative sense. Einsiedler–Katok–Lindenstrauss (2006) proved the set of counterexamples has Hausdorff dimension zero, earning Lindenstrauss the 2010 Fields Medal.",
    "problemStatement": "Let α, β ∈ ℝ. Is it true that lim inf (n → ∞) n · ‖nα‖ · ‖nβ‖ = 0, where ‖x‖ is the distance to the nearest integer?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define the distance-to-nearest-integer function distInt, the Littlewood product, and state the conjecture as an infinitely-often condition. Special cases (rational, cubic irrationals via Cassels–Swinnerton-Dyer) and the EKL dimension-zero theorem are axiomatized.",
