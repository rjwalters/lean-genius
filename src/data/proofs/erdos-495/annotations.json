    "content": "**The Littlewood Conjecture** is one of the most famous open problems in number theory. It asks: for any two real numbers α and β, can you always find integers n that make the product n · ‖nα‖ · ‖nβ‖ arbitrarily small? Here ‖x‖ means the distance from x to the nearest whole number. Think of it as asking whether every pair of reals can be simultaneously well-approximated by fractions, in a multiplicative sense.",
    "mathContext": "The conjecture states lim inf_{n→∞} n·‖nα‖·‖nβ‖ = 0 for all α, β ∈ ℝ. This is a multiplicative strengthening of Dirichlet's theorem on simultaneous approximation. Open since c. 1930.",
