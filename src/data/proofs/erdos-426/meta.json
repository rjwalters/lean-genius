  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originated with Erdős and Entringer in 1972. They asked whether a graph could have as many unique subgraphs as there are non-isomorphic graphs (~ 2^(n choose 2)/n! by Pólya). Entringer-Erdős achieved 2^{(n choose 2) - O(n^{3/2})} unique subgraphs. Brouwer (1975) improved this to 2^{(n choose 2) - O(n)}/n!.\n\nErdős believed Brouwer's construction was essentially optimal and offered $25 for a proof. Spencer suggested the full bound might be achievable (Erdős offered $100 for such a construction). In 2024, Bradač and Christoph proved the answer is NO: f(n) = o(2^(n choose 2)/n!).",
    "problemStatement": "We say H is a **unique subgraph** of G if there is exactly one way to find H as a subgraph (not necessarily induced) of G.\n\n**Question:** Is there a graph on n vertices with ≫ 2^(n choose 2)/n! many distinct unique subgraphs?\n\n**Answer:** NO (Bradač-Christoph 2024)\n\nf(n) = o(2^(n choose 2)/n!), with the o(1) being O(log log log n / log log n).\n\n**Historical bounds:**\n- Brouwer (1975): 2^{(n choose 2) - O(n)}/n! unique subgraphs achievable\n- Bradač-Christoph (2024): 2^(n choose 2)/n! is NOT achievable",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize unique subgraphs via SubgraphCopy, IsUniqueSubgraph, and CountUniqueSubgraphs. The maximum f(n) = maxUniqueSubgraphs is defined. Historical constructions (Entringer-Erdős, Brouwer) and the Bradač-Christoph resolution are axiomatized. The main theorem establishes ¬OriginalQuestion.",

      "Number of non-isomorphic graphs on n vertices is ~ 2^(n choose 2)/n! (Pólya)",
      "A unique subgraph must embed in exactly one way - this is rare",
      "Brouwer's construction loses a factor of 2^{O(n)} from the naive bound",
      "Bradač-Christoph show even the naive bound is unachievable",

    "implications": "The result shows that unique subgraphs are fundamentally rare. Most graphs have structural regularities (automorphisms, repeated patterns) that create multiple embeddings of any subgraph. This has implications for graph reconstruction and identification.",
