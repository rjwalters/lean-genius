Is there a graph on $n$ vertices with\\[\\gg \\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}\\]many distinct unique subgraphs?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Entringer \\cite{EnEr72}, who constructed a graph with\\[\\gg 2^{\\binom{n}{2}-O(n^{3/2+o(1)})}\\]many unique subgraphs. This was improved by Harary and Schwenk \\cite{HaSc73} and then by Brouwer \\cite{Br75}, who constructed a graph with\\[\\gg \\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}-O(n)}}{n!}\\]many unique subgraphs.\n\nNote that there are $\\sim 2^{\\binom{n}{2}}/n!$ many non-isomorphic graphs on $n$ vertices (folklore, often attributed to P\\'{o}lya), and hence the bound in the problem statement is trivially best possible.\n\nErd\\H{o}s believed Brouwer's construction was essentially best possible, but Spencer suggested that $\\gg \\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}$ may be possible. Erd\\H{o}s offered \\$100 for such a construction and \\$25 for a proof that no such construction is possible.\n\nBrada\\v{c} and Christoph \\cite{BrCh24} have proved the answer is no: if $f(n)$ is the maximum number of unique subgraphs in a graph on $n$ vertices then\\[f(n) = o\\left(\\frac{2^{\\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}\\right).\\](Quantitatively the $o(1)$ in their argument can be taken to be $O(\\frac{\\log\\log\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$.)\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Br75] Brouwer, A.
