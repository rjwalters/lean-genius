    "content": "There are infinitely many primitive pseudoperfect numbers. Every multiple of a pseudoperfect number is pseudoperfect, which means primitivity is determined by the 'minimal' elements in the divisibility order.",
    "significance": "The multiplicative closure ensures that the primitive elements form an antichain in the divisibility order, analogous to primitive abundant numbers."

    "content": "Erdős asked whether the sum of 1/n over all primitive pseudoperfect numbers n converges. The formalization asserts convergence via a uniform bound on finite partial sums.",
    "significance": "Convergence would imply the set is very sparse (sparser than primes). This is a fundamental question about the distribution of these divisor-sum extremal numbers."
