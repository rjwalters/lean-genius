  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980) studied sequences that are strongly complete (removing finitely many terms preserves completeness) but fragile (removing infinitely many destroys it). Graham (1964) showed F_n − (−1)^n is such a sequence. The golden ratio φ = (1+√5)/2 appears as the threshold: if a_{n+1}/a_n > φ, fragility is automatic.",
    "problemStatement": "If A is lacunary, strongly complete, and fragile, must lim a_{n+1}/a_n = φ?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines subset sums, completeness, strong completeness, and fragility. Graham's example is axiomatised. The golden ratio threshold and the main conjecture are stated, along with the existence of irregular (non-lacunary) counterexamples.",
