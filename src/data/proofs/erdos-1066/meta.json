  "description": "Let G be a graph given by n points in ℝ² where any two distinct points are at least distance 1 apart, and we draw an edge between two points if they are distance exactly 1 apart. Let g(n) be maximal such that any such graph always has an independent set on at least g(n) vertices. Estimate g(n), or perhaps lim g(n)/n.",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns unit distance graphs in the plane, where points at minimum distance 1 are connected by edges if exactly at distance 1. Such graphs are always planar (edges cannot cross without forcing points closer than 1). Erdős initially conjectured g(n) = n/3, but this was disproved. The problem connects to the Four Colour Theorem, planar graph coloring, and discrete geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph given by n points in ℝ², where any two distinct points are at least distance 1 apart, and we draw an edge between two points if they are distance 1 apart. Let g(n) be maximal such that any such graph always has an independent set on at least g(n) vertices. Estimate g(n), or perhaps lim g(n)/n.",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem remains open. Current approach combines:\n\n1. **Lower bounds via planarity**: Unit distance graphs are planar (edges can't cross), so the Four Colour Theorem implies g(n) ≥ n/4. Improved by geometric arguments.\n\n2. **Upper bounds via constructions**: Explicit point configurations showing g(n) cannot exceed certain thresholds.\n\n**Current best bounds:**\n- Lower: (8/31)n ≈ 0.258n (Swanepoel 2002)\n- Upper: (5/16)n = 0.3125n (Pach-Tóth 1996)\n\nThe gap 8/31 to 5/16 remains to be closed.",

      "Unit distance graphs with minimum distance 1 are always planar - edges cannot cross",
      "Planarity implies 4-colorability, giving g(n) ≥ n/4 as a baseline",
      "Erdős's original conjecture g(n) = n/3 was disproved by constructions",
      "The true asymptotic density lim g(n)/n lies in [8/31, 5/16] ≈ [0.258, 0.3125]",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1066 asks for the guaranteed independent set size g(n) in unit distance graphs. The current best bounds are (8/31)n ≤ g(n) ≤ (5/16)n, with a gap of about 5.4% of n. The problem connects planarity, the Four Colour Theorem, and discrete geometry.",
    "implications": "Closing the gap between 8/31 and 5/16 would require either: (1) new geometric arguments improving the lower bound beyond Swanepoel's technique, or (2) clever constructions improving the upper bound beyond Pach-Tóth's configuration.",
