Estimate $g(n)$, or perhaps $\\lim \\frac{g(n)}{n}$.\n\n\n\nSuch graphs are always planar. Erd\\H{o}s initially thought that $g(n)=n/3$, but Chung and Graham, and independently Pach, gave a construction that shows $g(n)\\leq \\frac{6}{19}n$. Pach and Toth \\cite{PaTo96} improved this to $g(n)\\leq \\frac{5}{16}n$.\n\nPollack \\cite{Po85} noted that the Four colour theorem implies $g(n)\\geq n/4$, since the graph is planar. Pollack reports that Pach observed that this in for unit distance graphs the four colour theorem can be proved by a simple induction.\n\nThis lower bound has been improved to $\\frac{9}{35}n$ by Csizmadia \\cite{Cs98} and then $\\frac{8}{31}n$ by Swanepoel \\cite{Sw02}. The current record bounds are therefore\\[\\frac{8}{31}n \\approx 0.258n \\leq g(n) \\leq 0.3125n=\\frac{5}{16}n.\\]Pollack \\cite{Po85} also reports a letter from Erd\\H{o}s which poses the more general problem of, given $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with minimum distance $1$, let $g_d(n)$ be maximal such that there always exist at least $g_d(n)$ many points which have minimum distance $>1$. Is it true that $g_d(n) \\gg n/d$ in general? The upper bound $g_d(n) \\ll n/d$ is trivial, considering widely spaced unit simplices.\n\nSee [1070] for the general estimate of independence number of unit distance graphs.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cs98] Csizmadia, G., On the independence number of minimum distance graphs.
