    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #217: Distance Multiplicities in Point Configurations**\n\nThis elegant problem asks for point configurations with a specific \"staircase\" pattern of distance multiplicities. Given n points, there are n(n-1)/2 point pairs. If we have n-1 distinct distances with multiplicities 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1, the total is exactly 1+2+...+(n-1) = n(n-1)/2 - a perfect match!\n\n**Known Constructions:**\n- **n = 4:** Erdős noted an isosceles triangle with center point works.\n- **n = 5:** Pomerance constructed an example, surprising Erdős who thought n ≥ 5 was impossible.\n- **n = 6, 7, 8:** Palásti proved existence for these cases.\n\n**Erdős's Conjecture:** Such configurations should be impossible for sufficiently large n. This connects to Problem #98 on minimum distinct distances in point sets.",

No four points lie on a common circle\n3. The points determine exactly $n-1$ distinct distances\n4. In some ordering, the $i$-th distance appears exactly $i$ times?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- $n = 4$: YES (isosceles triangle + center)\n- $n = 5$: YES (Pomerance)\n- $n \\leq 8$: YES (Palásti)\n- $n$ large: Conjectured NO\n\n**Status: OPEN** - The exact characterization of valid $n$ is unknown.",
