Erd\\H{o}s originally believed this was impossible for $n\\geq 5$, but Pomerance constructed a set with $n=5$ (see \\cite{Er83c} for a description), and Pal\\'{a}sti has proved such sets exist for all $n\\leq 8$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s believed this is impossible for all sufficiently large $n$. This would follow from $h(n)\\geq n$ for sufficiently large $n$, where $h(n)$ is as in [98].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er83c] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Combinatorial problems in geometry. Math.
