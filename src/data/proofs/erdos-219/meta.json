  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is one of the oldest and most natural questions about prime numbers: can we find arbitrarily long sequences of primes in arithmetic progression? The question appears as Problem A5 in Richard Guy's 'Unsolved Problems in Number Theory'.\n\nThe Green-Tao theorem (2008) provides a resounding YES. Ben Green and Terence Tao proved that for every k, there exists an arithmetic progression of k primes. Their proof, published in the Annals of Mathematics, is a landmark of 21st century mathematics, combining techniques from ergodic theory, combinatorics, and analytic number theory.\n\nThe result earned Tao and Green numerous accolades and opened new research directions in additive combinatorics.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question**: Are there arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes?\n\n**Answer**: YES\n\nFor every positive integer $k$, there exist primes $p, p+d, p+2d, \\ldots, p+(k-1)d$ forming an arithmetic progression of length $k$.\n\n**Examples**:\n- $k = 3$: $\\{3, 5, 7\\}$ (difference 2)\n- $k = 5$: $\\{5, 11, 17, 23, 29\\}$ (difference 6)\n- $k = 6$: $\\{7, 37, 67, 97, 127, 157\\}$ (difference 30)\n\n**Record**: The longest known AP of primes has 23 terms (Pritchard et al., 2019).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. **Arithmetic progressions of primes**: Define what it means for a finite set to be a prime AP\n2. **The Green-Tao theorem**: Axiomatize that for all k, such progressions exist\n3. **Verified examples**: Prove {3,5,7} and {5,11,17,23,29} are prime APs\n4. **Related open problem**: State the consecutive prime AP question\n\nThe Green-Tao theorem itself is axiomatized because its proof requires deep machinery from ergodic theory and harmonic analysis that goes far beyond Mathlib.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #219, which asks whether there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes. The Green-Tao theorem (2008) proves the answer is YES. We axiomatize this deep result and verify concrete examples for k = 3 and k = 5.",
    "implications": "The Green-Tao theorem is a cornerstone of modern additive combinatorics. It shows that primes, despite being 'sparse' (density 1/log n), still contain enough structure to guarantee arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This has inspired significant research in ergodic methods for number theory.",
