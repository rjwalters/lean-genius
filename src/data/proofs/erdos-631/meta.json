    "historicalContext": "List coloring generalizes ordinary graph coloring by allowing each vertex to have its own set of available colors. The list chromatic number χ_L(G) is the minimum k such that G is k-choosable.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- 1979: Erdős, Rubin, Taylor posed the problem\n- 1993: Voigt constructed a planar graph with χ_L = 5\n- 1994: Thomassen proved χ_L ≤ 5 for all planar graphs\n- 1996: Gutner gave simpler construction\n- 2000s: Search for smallest non-4-choosable planar graph\n\n**Key insight:** χ_L can exceed χ, and the gap χ_L vs χ for planar graphs is exactly 1.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question 1:** Does every planar graph have χ_L(G) ≤ 5?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Thomassen 1994)\n\n**Question 2:** Is this best possible?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Voigt 1993)\n\nThomassen's proof is remarkably short and elegant, using induction on vertices + edges. Voigt's construction shows the bound cannot be improved.\n\n**Open:** Is χ_L ≤ 4 for planar? (List Coloring Conjecture)",
