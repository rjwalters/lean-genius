  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Intersection problems for set families are fundamental in extremal combinatorics. The classical Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem concerns intersecting families (avoiding 0-intersection). Erdős asked about avoiding r-intersection for general r, particularly whether an exponential bound holds when r is a constant fraction of n. The problem carried a $250 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "Let T(n,r) be the maximum size of a family F of subsets of {1,...,n} such that |A ∩ B| ≠ r for all A, B in F. Estimate T(n,r). In particular, for every ε > 0, is there δ > 0 such that T(n,r) < (2 - δ)^n for εn < r < (1/2 - ε)n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines r-avoiding families and T(n,r), establishes the trivial case T(n,0) = 2^{n-1}, states the Frankl-Füredi optimal families for fixed r, and axiomatizes the Frankl-Rödl theorem proving the exponential bound for the middle range.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "T(n,0) = 2^{n-1} corresponds to classical intersecting families",
      "Large sets (size > (n+r)/2) avoid r-intersection with each other",
      "The middle range εn < r < (1/2-ε)n exhibits exponential gap from 2^n",
