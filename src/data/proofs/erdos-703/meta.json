    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $r\\geq 1$ and define $T(n,r)$ to be maximal such that there exists a family $\\mathcal{F}$ of subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ of size $T(n,r)$ such that $\\lvert A\\cap B\\rvert\\neq r$ for all $A,B\\in \\mathcal{F}$.\n\nEstimate $T(n,r)$ for $r\\geq 2$. In particular, is it true that for every $\\epsilon>0$ there exists $\\delta>0$ such that for all $\\epsilon n<r<(1/2-\\epsilon) n$ we have\\[T(n,r)<(2-\\delta)^n?\\]\n\n\n\nIt is trivial that $T(n,0)=2^{n-1}$. Frankl and F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{FrFu84b} proved that, for fixed $r$ and $n$ sufficiently large in terms of $r$, the maximal $T(n,r)$ is achieved by taking\\[\\mathcal{F} = \\left\\{ A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\} : \\lvert A\\rvert> \\frac{n+r}{2}\\textrm{ or }\\lvert A\\rvert < r\\right\\}\\]when $n+r$ is odd, and\\[\\mathcal{F} = \\left\\{ A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,n\\} : \\lvert A\\backslash \\{1\\}\\rvert\\geq \\frac{n+r}{2}\\textrm{ or }\\lvert A\\rvert < r\\right\\}\\]when $n+r$ is even. (Frankl \\cite{Fr77b} had earlier proved this for $r=1$ and all $n$.)\n\nAn affirmative answer to the second question implies that the chromatic number of the unit distance graph in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ (with two points joined by an edge if the distance between them is $1$) grows exponentially in $n$, which was proved by alternative methods by Frankl and Wilson \\cite{FrWi81} - see [704].\n\nThe answer to the second question is yes, proved by Frankl and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{FrRo87}.\n\nSee also [702].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Fr77b] Frankl, P., An intersection problem for finite sets.
