  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the distribution of prime factors in values of irreducible polynomials. Nagell and Ricci established the first bound in 1922, showing F_f(n) ≫ n log n. Erdős improved this in 1952 using sieve methods. The problem has connections to algebraic number theory through the splitting of primes in number fields. While Erdős claimed a stronger bound in 1965, the proof was never published and was later found to be flawed. Tenenbaum finally proved the bound F_f(n) ≫ n exp((log n)^c) in 1990, but the main polynomial growth conjectures remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f ∈ ℤ[x] be an irreducible polynomial of degree d ≥ 2. Define F_f(n) = max{p prime : p | f(m) for some 1 ≤ m ≤ n}, equivalently the greatest prime divisor of ∏_{m=1}^n f(m). Question: Is F_f(n) ≫ n^{1+c} for some constant c > 0? Or even ≫ n^d?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization presents the known bounds as axioms and defines the main conjectures precisely. The Nagell-Ricci bound uses elementary methods. Erdős's 1952 improvement uses sieve techniques to count integers with large prime factors. Tenenbaum's proof employs sophisticated large sieve inequalities. The algebraic approach relates prime divisors of f(m) to prime splitting in the number field ℚ[x]/(f) via Chebotarev's density theorem.",
