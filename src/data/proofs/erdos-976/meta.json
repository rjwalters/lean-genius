Let $F_f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists $1\\leq m\\leq n$ with $f(m)$ is divisible by a prime $\\geq F_f(n)$. Equivalently, $F_f(n)$ is the greatest prime divisor of\\[\\prod_{1\\leq m\\leq n}f(m).\\]Estimate $F_f(n)$. In particular, is it true that $F_f(n)\\gg n^{1+c}$ for some constant $c>0$? Or even $\\gg n^d$?\n\n\n\nNagell and Ricci \\cite{Na22} proved that\\[F_f(n) \\gg n\\log n,\\]which Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er52c} improved to\\[F_f(n) \\gg n(\\log n)^{\\log\\log\\log n}.\\]In \\cite{Er65b} he claimed a proof of\\[F_f(n) \\gg n\\exp((\\log n)^c)\\]for some constant $c>0$, but said he had never published the proof, which was 'fairly complicated'. This seems to have been flawed, since Erd\\H{o}s and Schinzel \\cite{ErSc90} later published a weaker bound. A proof of the stronger bound above was finally provided by Tenenbaum \\cite{Te90}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er52c] Erd\\H{o}s, P., On the greatest prime factor of {$\\prod^x_{k=1}f(k)$}. J.
