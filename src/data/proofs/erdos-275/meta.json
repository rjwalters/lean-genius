  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns 'covering systems' - finite collections of congruence classes that cover all integers. Erdős pioneered the study of such systems. The question asks: how many consecutive integers must r congruence classes cover to guarantee they cover all integers? The answer is exactly 2^r, proved independently by Selfridge and by Crittenden-Vanden Eynden in 1970.",
    "problemStatement": "If a finite system of r congruences {aᵢ (mod nᵢ) : 1 ≤ i ≤ r} covers 2^r consecutive integers, then it covers all integers.\n\n**This bound is tight:** The system {2^(i-1) (mod 2^i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ r} covers exactly the integers NOT divisible by 2^r, showing that 2^r - 1 consecutive integers don't suffice.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n1. Congruence classes as sets of integers\n2. Covering systems as finite collections of such classes\n3. The main theorem: 2^r consecutive integers suffice\n4. The optimal example showing tightness\n\nThe proof (axiomatized) uses induction on the structure of moduli mod 2.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #275 is SOLVED. If r congruence classes cover 2^r consecutive integers, they cover all integers. The bound 2^r is optimal, as shown by the example {2^(i-1) (mod 2^i) : 1 ≤ i ≤ r} which needs exactly 2^r consecutive integers.",
    "implications": "This result characterizes the threshold for finite covering by congruence classes. It shows that the exponential bound 2^r, rather than any polynomial, is the critical threshold.",
