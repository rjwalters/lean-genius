    "historicalContext": "List coloring generalizes ordinary graph coloring by allowing each vertex to have its own set of available colors. The question is whether a proper coloring exists for ANY assignment of lists of size k.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- 1980: Erdős, Rubin, Taylor posed the problem\n- 1992: Alon & Tarsi proved YES using algebraic methods\n- 1994: Thomassen proved all planar graphs are 5-choosable\n- The 'List Coloring Conjecture' (χ_L ≤ 4 for planar) remains OPEN\n\n**Key insight:** χ_L can exceed χ, even for bipartite graphs!",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition:** The list chromatic number χ_L(G) is the minimum k such that for ANY assignment of lists of k colors to vertices, a proper list coloring exists.\n\n**Question:** For planar bipartite graphs, is χ_L(G) ≤ 3?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Alon-Tarsi 1992)\n\nThis is remarkable because:\n- Bipartite graphs have χ = 2\n- But χ_L can be larger (even K_{2,4} needs χ_L = 3)\n- Planarity bounds χ_L at 3 for bipartite graphs",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines list assignment and list coloring\n2. Defines k-choosability and χ_L\n3. Shows χ_L ≥ χ always\n4. Defines planarity and states Four Color Theorem\n5. States Alon-Tarsi theorem as main result\n6. Introduces graph polynomial and Combinatorial Nullstellensatz\n7. Shows bound is tight (K_{2,4})\n8.
