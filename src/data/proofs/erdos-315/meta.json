Let $a_1<a_2<\\cdots $ be any other sequence with $\\sum \\frac{1}{a_k}=1$. Is it true that\\[\\liminf a_n^{1/2^n}<\\lim u_n^{1/2^n}=c_0=1.264085\\cdots?\\]\n\n\n\n$c_0$ is called the Vardi constant and the sequence $u_n$ is Sylvester's sequence.\n\nIn \\cite{ErGr80} this problem is stated with the sequence $u_1=1$ and $u_{n+1}=u_n(u_n+1)$, but Quanyu Tang has pointed out this is probably an error (since with that choice we do not have $\\sum \\frac{1}{u_n}=1$). This question with Sylvester's sequence is the most natural interpretation of what they meant to ask.\n\nThis is true, and was proved independently by Kamio \\cite{Ka25} and Li and Tang \\cite{LiTa25}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGr80] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Graham, R., Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory.
