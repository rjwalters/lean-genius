    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet u₁ = 2, u_{n+1} = u_n² - u_n + 1 (Sylvester's sequence).\n\nFor any other strictly increasing sequence a₁ < a₂ < ... with Σ 1/a_k = 1:\n\n**Question:** Is liminf a_n^{1/2^n} < lim u_n^{1/2^n} = c₀ ≈ 1.264085?\n\n**Answer: YES** - Kamio (2025), Li-Tang (2025)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Sylvester's Sequence:**\n   - sylvester: recursive definition\n   - Proved: strict monotonicity, all terms ≥ 2\n   - Key identity: u_{n+1} - 1 = u_n(u_n - 1)\n\n2. **The Vardi Constant:**\n   - vardiConstant: c₀ = lim u_n^{1/2^n}\n   - Axiomatized bounds: 1.264 < c₀ < 1.265\n\n3. **Egyptian Sequences:**\n   - EgyptianSequence: structure for sequences summing to 1\n   - growthRate: liminf measure of growth\n\n4. **Main Result:**\n   - erdosGrahamConjecture: Sylvester is maximal\n   - kamio_li_tang_2025: axiom for the proof",

      "**Greedy Optimality:** Sylvester's sequence arises from always taking the largest unit fraction not exceeding the remainder. This greedy choice turns out to be globally optimal!",
      "**Double Exponential Growth:** u_n ~ c₀^{2^n}, so the growth is doubly exponential - tower of exponents.",
      "**The Vardi Constant:** c₀ ≈ 1.264085... is a transcendental number with deep connections to dynamics and continued fractions.",
      "**Historical Error:** The original 1980 formulation had u₁ = 1, which doesn't give Σ 1/u_n = 1. Corrected by Quanyu Tang.",
      "**Recent Solution:** This problem was open for 45 years until independently solved in 2025 by Kamio in Japan and Li-Tang in China."
