This fails if the graph has chromatic number $\\aleph_0$.\n\nA theorem of de Bruijn and Erd\\H{os} \\cite{dBEr51} implies that, if $G$ has infinite chromatic number, then $G$ has a finite subgraph of chromatic number $n$ for every $n\\geq 1$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er95d} Erd\\H{o}s suggests this is true, although such an $F$ must grow faster than the $k$-fold iterated exponential function for any $k$.\n\nShelah \\cite{KoSh05} proved that it is consistent that the answer is no. Lambie-Hanson \\cite{La20} constructed a counterexample in ZFC.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHS82] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A. and Szemer\\'{e}di, E., On almost bipartite large chromatic graphs.
