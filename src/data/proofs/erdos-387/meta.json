A counterexample is given by $n=99215$ and $k=15$. Schinzel conjectured (see problem B34 of \\cite{Gu04}) that, for all sufficiently large $k$ which are not prime powers, there exists an $n$ such that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is not divisible by any integer in $(n-k,n]$.\n\nIt is easy to see that $\\binom{n}{k}$ always has a divisor in $[n/k,n]$.\n\nFaulkner \\cite{Fa66} proved that, if $p$ is the least prime $>2k$ and $n\\geq p$, then $\\binom{n}{k}$ has a prime divisor $\\geq p$ (except $\\binom{9}{2}$ and $\\binom{10}{3}$).\n\nThis is discussed in problems B33 and B34 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}, who says that Erd\\H{o}s conjectured this is true for any $c<1$ (if $n$ is sufficiently large).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Fa66] Faulkner, M., On a theorem of {S}ylvester and {S}chur.
