This was question was posed by Erd\\H{o}s to Soifer in January 1992.\n\nThe smallest number of edges is $9$, achieved solely by $K_{3,3}$, proved by House \\cite{Ho13}. An alternative proof was given by Chaffee and Noble \\cite{ChNo16}, who also prove that the smallest number of edges in a graph of dimension $5$ is $15$ (achieved by $K_6$ and $K_{1,3,3}$).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ChNo16] Chaffee, Joe and Noble, Matt, Dimension 4 and dimension 5 graphs with minimum edge set.
