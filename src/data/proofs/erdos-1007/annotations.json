    "content": "Erdős #1007 asks for the minimum edges in a 4-dimensional graph. Graph dimension is a geometric invariant: the smallest n such that the graph embeds in ℝⁿ with all edges having unit length. The answer is 9 edges, achieved uniquely by K_{3,3}.",

    "content": "A unit distance embedding places vertices in ℝⁿ so every edge has Euclidean length exactly 1. The structure captures the embedding function and the constraint that adjacent vertices are at unit distance. Graph dimension is the minimum n where such an embedding exists.",
