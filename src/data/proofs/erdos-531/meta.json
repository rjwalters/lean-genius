    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #531: Folkman's Theorem**\n\nThis problem asks about the quantitative aspects of Folkman's theorem, a fundamental result in Ramsey theory.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Sanders and Folkman (1960s): Proved the existence of F(k)\n- Rado's theorem (1933): Provides an alternative proof via partition regularity\n- Erdős-Spencer (1989): First non-trivial lower bound F(k) ≥ 2^{ck²/log k}\n- Balogh et al. (2017): Improved to F(k) ≥ 2^{2^{k-1}/k}\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe function F(k) is the Folkman number: the minimum N such that any 2-coloring of {1,...,N} contains a k-element subset where all 2^k - 1 non-empty subset sums are monochromatic.",

Estimate F(k).\n\n**Known Results:**\n$$F(k) \\geq 2^{2^{k-1}/k}$$\n\nBalogh-Eberhard-Narayanan-Treglown-Wagner (2017) proved this doubly-exponential lower bound, improving on Erdős-Spencer (1989).\n\nThe upper bound (from Folkman's existence proof) is much larger, leaving a huge gap.",
