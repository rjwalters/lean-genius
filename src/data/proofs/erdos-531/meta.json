Estimate $F(k)$.\n\n\n\nThe existence of $F(k)$ was established by Sanders and Folkman, and it also follows from Rado's theorem. It is commonly known as Folkman's theorem.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Spencer \\cite{ErSp89} proved that\\[F(k) \\geq 2^{ck^2/\\log k}\\]for some constant $c>0$. Balogh, Eberhrad, Narayanan, Treglown, and Wagner \\cite{BENTW17} have improved this to\\[F(k) \\geq 2^{2^{k-1}/k}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BENTW17] Balogh, J\\'{o}zsef and Eberhard, Sean and Narayanan, Bhargav and Treglown, Andrew and Wagner, Adam Zsolt, An improved lower bound for Folkman's theorem.
