  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this problem in 1980 about the maximum size of subsets of {1,...,N} with distinct reciprocal subset sums. Bleicher and Erdős established matching bounds up to iterated logarithmic factors in 1975–1976, but the precise asymptotics remain open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let R(N) be the maximum |A| for A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that all subset sums Σ_{n∈S} 1/n are distinct for S ⊆ A. Determine R(N) asymptotically. Current bounds: (N/log N)·Π log_i N ≤ R(N) ≤ (1/log 2)·log_r N·(N/log N)·Π log_i N.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define distinct reciprocal subset sums and R(N), state the known Bleicher–Erdős bounds, and identify the iterated logarithm gap as the open question.",

      "R(N) = Θ(N/log N) up to iterated logarithm factors",
      "Lower bound: (N/log N) · product of iterated logs (Bleicher–Erdős 1975)",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #321 asks for the precise asymptotics of R(N), the maximum subset of {1,...,N} with distinct reciprocal sums. The Bleicher–Erdős bounds from the 1970s pin down R(N) to within an iterated logarithm factor of N/log N, but closing this gap remains open.",
