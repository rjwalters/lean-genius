  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Gallai conjectured that the clique transversal number τ(G) is at most n − H(n), where H(n) is the largest independent set guaranteed in triangle-free n-vertex graphs. The easy bound τ ≤ n − √n follows from Ramsey theory. Even the K₄-free case is open. Erdős described the conjecture as 'perhaps completely wrongheaded.'",
    "problemStatement": "Is τ(G) ≤ n − H(n) for every graph G on n vertices?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatises cliques, maximal cliques, independence, and triangle-freeness. Defines clique transversals and axiomatises τ(G) and H(n) with their specifications. The easy bound and the main conjecture are stated.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "τ(G) is the minimum vertex set hitting every maximal clique of size ≥ 2",
      "H(n) ~ √n by Ramsey theory (R(3,k) gives triangle-free independent sets)",
      "The easy bound τ ≤ n − √n falls short of the conjecture",
      "Even the K₄-free case remains open"
