Erd\\H{o}s was 'almost certain that such a set does not exist'.\n\nIn fact, such a set does exist, as proved by Jackson and Mauldin \\cite{JaMa02}. Their construction depends on the axiom of choice.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[JaMa02] Jackson, Steve and Mauldin, R. Daniel, Sets meeting isometric copies of the lattice ${\\bf Z}^2$ in exactly one point. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2002), 15883-15887.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
