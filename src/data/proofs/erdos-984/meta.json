  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, posed by Spencer, asks whether the natural numbers can be 2-colored such that monochromatic arithmetic progressions have controlled length. Spencer (1975) showed 3 colors suffice with bound related to the inverse van der Waerden function. Erdős claimed a 2-coloring with k ≪ a^{1-c} but noted no non-trivial lower bound was known. Zach Hunter resolved the full question affirmatively.",
    "problemStatement": "Can ℕ be 2-colored such that if {a, a+d, ..., a+(k-1)d} is a k-term monochromatic arithmetic progression, then k ≪_ε a^ε for all ε > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses: (1) Definition of colorings and monochromatic arithmetic progressions, (2) Formalization of the growth condition k ≪_ε a^ε, (3) Connection to van der Waerden's theorem which forces monochromatic APs, (4) Axiomatization of Hunter's probabilistic construction, and (5) Proof that 1 color is trivially insufficient.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Van der Waerden's theorem guarantees monochromatic APs exist in any finite coloring",
      "The question is about controlling how long these progressions can be relative to their starting point",
      "With 3 colors, Spencer achieved a bound via the inverse van der Waerden function",
      "Hunter's breakthrough shows 2 colors suffice for the k ≪_ε a^ε bound"
