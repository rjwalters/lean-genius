Suppose that the sequence of\\[s_k=\\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq n}z_i^k\\]contains infinitely many $(n-1)$-tuples of consecutive values of $s_k$ which are all $0$. Then (essentially)\\[z_j=e(j/n),\\]where $e(x)=e^{2\\pi ix}$.\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Tur\\'{a}n. Erd\\H{o}s speculates that this may be true if there are two distinct $(n-1)$-tuples of consecutive values of $s_k$ which are $0$. He does not elaborate on what the 'essentially' may mean precisely.\n\nThis is true (in the stronger form with only two such tuples) - in fact if $n$ is odd then the $z_i$ must be exactly the $n$th roots of unity, and if $n$ is even they must be the vertices of two regular $(n/2)$-gons with the same circumscribed circle centred at the origin. This was first proved by Tijdeman \\cite{Ti66}. An independent proof of this was given in the comments section by Hu, Tang, and Zhang.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ti66] Tijdeman, R., On a conjecture of {T}ur\\'an and {E}rd\\H{o}s. Indag. Math.
