    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #974: Power Sums and Roots of Unity**\n\nThis elegant problem connects complex analysis with algebra through power sums. It originates from a conjecture by Turán, with Erdős posing a stronger version.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Turán: Original conjecture about infinitely many zero tuples\n- Erdős: Speculated that TWO such tuples might suffice\n- Tijdeman (1966): Proved the strong form in full generality\n- Hu, Tang, Zhang: Independent proof via comments\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nGiven z₁, ..., zₙ ∈ ℂ with z₁ = 1, the power sums sₖ = Σ zᵢᵏ encode algebraic information about the configuration. The question asks: when can many consecutive power sums vanish?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet z₁, ..., zₙ ∈ ℂ with z₁ = 1. Define power sums:\n$$s_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i^k$$\n\n**Conjecture (Turán):** If infinitely many (n-1)-tuples of consecutive sₖ are all 0, then essentially:\n$$z_j = e(j/n) = e^{2\\pi i j/n}$$\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nTijdeman (1966) proved a stronger result: only TWO distinct (n-1)-tuples suffice!",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Configuration Definition:**\n   - Configuration n := Fin n → ℂ (n complex numbers)\n   - powerSum: the kth power sum sₖ\n   - nthRootOfUnity: exp(2πij/n)\n\n2. **Zero Tuple Predicates:**\n   - consecutiveZeroTuple: (sₖ, ..., sₖ₊ₙ₋₂) all zero\n   - hasInfinitelyManyZeroTuples: arbitrarily large starting indices\n\n3. **Main Theorems:**\n   - turan_conjecture: infinitely many → roots of unity\n   - tijdeman_1966_odd: 2 tuples suffice for odd n\n   - tijdeman_1966_even: 2 tuples give two (n/2)-gons for even n\n   - erdos_974_solved: wraps the main result",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Newton's Identities Connection:** Power sums relate to elementary symmetric polynomials via Newton's formulas. Consecutive zeros severely constrain the characteristic polynomial.",
      "**Why n-1 Tuples?** A configuration of n points is determined by n complex numbers. Power sums up to sₙ determine the elementary symmetric functions, hence the minimal polynomial.",
      "**Roots of Unity Property:** For ζ = nth root of unity, sₖ = n if n|k, else sₖ = 0. So any n-1 consecutive sums starting away from multiples of n are zero.",
      "**The 'Essentially' Qualifier:** Power sums are symmetric — permuting the zᵢ doesn't change sₖ. For even n, two rotated (n/2)-gons also work.",
      "**Stronger Than Expected:** Erdős speculated 2 tuples might suffice. Tijdeman proved this, showing the constraint is remarkably rigid."
