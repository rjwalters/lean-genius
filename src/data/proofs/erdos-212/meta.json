Erd\\H{o}s believed there cannot be such a set. This problem is discussed in a blogpost by Terence Tao, in which he shows that there cannot be such a set, assuming the Bombieri-Lang conjecture. The same conclusion was independently obtained by Shaffaf \\cite{Sh18}.\n\nIndeed, Shaffaf and Tao actually proved that such a rational distance set must be contained in a finite union of real algebraic curves. Solymosi and de Zeeuw \\cite{SdZ10} then proved (unconditionally) that a rational distance set contained in a real algebraic curve must be finite, unless the curve contains a line or a circle.\n\nAscher, Braune, and Turchet \\cite{ABT20} observed that, combined, these facts imply that a rational distance set in general position must be finite (conditional on the Bombieri-Lang conjecture).\n\nIn \\cite{Er87b} Erd\\H{o}s mentions that Besicovitch conjectured that the limit points of a rational distance set cannot contain arbitrarily large convex sets.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ABT20] Ascher, K. and Braune, L. and Turchet, A., The Erd\\H{o}s-Ulam problem, Lang's conjecture, and uniformity. arXiv:1901.02616 (2020).\n\n[Er87b] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some combinatorial and metric problems in geometry.
