  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Selfridge (1967) studied the prime factors of consecutive integers n, n+1, ..., n+k. They defined v(n,k) as the count of prime factors of n+k that are 'new' (don't divide any earlier term). They proved v₀(n) ≥ 2 for n ≥ 17, with exceptions at n = 0,1,2,3,4,7,8,16, but could not establish divergence. The problem also appears as B27 in Guy's collection.",
    "problemStatement": "Let v(n,k) count the prime factors of n+k that do not divide n+i for 0 ≤ i < k. Let v₀(n) = max_{k ≥ 0} v(n,k). Does v₀(n) → ∞ as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define newPrimeFactorCount (v(n,k)) using Finset filtering on primeFactors, then v₀ as the supremum. ErdosProblem889 states divergence. Known results (v₀(n) ≥ 2 for n ≥ 17, exception list) are axiomatized. The generalized v_l and the exact power variant V(n,k) are also formalized.",
