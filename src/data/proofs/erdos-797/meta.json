In particular is it true that $f(d)=o(d^2)$?\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see that $f(d)\\leq d^2+1$ using a greedy colouring. Erd\\H{o}s had shown $f(d)\\geq d^{4/3-o(1)}$.\n\nResolved by Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed \\cite{AMR91} who showed\\[\\frac{d^{4/3}}{(\\log d)^{1/3}}\\ll f(d) \\ll d^{4/3}.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AMR91] Alon, Noga and McDiarmid, Colin and Reed, Bruce, Acyclic coloring of graphs.
