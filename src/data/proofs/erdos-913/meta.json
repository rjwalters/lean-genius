  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears in Erdős [Er82c, p.28]. It asks about the multiplicative structure of products of consecutive integers. The conditional approach via 8p²-1 primes was identified as a natural path, connecting the problem to the Bunyakovsky/Bateman–Horn conjectures on prime values of polynomials.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many n such that if n(n+1) = ∏ pᵢ^kᵢ is the factorization into distinct primes, then all exponents kᵢ are distinct?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define HasDistinctExponents using Mathlib's factorization and Set.InjOn on primeFactors. The main conjecture states DistinctExponentSet is infinite. The conditional result shows this follows from infinitely many primes p with 8p²-1 prime, since n = 8p²-1 gives n(n+1) with exponents {1,2,3}.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For n = 8p²-1 with p and 8p²-1 both prime, n(n+1) = (8p²-1)·p²·2³ has exponents {1,2,3}",
      "The conditional proof uses Finsupp arithmetic and factorization multiplicativity",
      "The hypothesis on 8p²-1 primes is a special case of the Bunyakovsky conjecture",
      "Many Mersenne-like numbers n = 2^k - 1 give examples with exponents {k,1}"
