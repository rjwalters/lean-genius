  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Dirichlet's theorem (1837) was the first use of analytic methods to prove results about the distribution of primes. While Euclid had proved there are infinitely many primes (c. 300 BCE), Dirichlet showed something far more refined: primes are equidistributed among arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe proof required Dirichlet to invent entirely new mathematical machinery: Dirichlet characters (group homomorphisms from (Z/qZ)* to C*) and L-functions (infinite series generalizing the Riemann zeta function). These tools became foundational for all of analytic number theory.\n\nThe key difficulty is proving that L(1, chi) is not zero for non-principal characters chi. For real characters, this requires showing the residue at s=1 is positive, which Dirichlet accomplished through careful analysis.",
    "problemStatement": "**Dirichlet's Theorem** (1837):\n\nFor any two positive coprime integers $a$ and $q$ (i.e., $\\gcd(a, q) = 1$), there are infinitely many prime numbers $p$ such that:\n$$p \\equiv a \\pmod{q}$$\n\nEquivalently, every arithmetic progression $a, a+q, a+2q, a+3q, \\ldots$ where $\\gcd(a,q) = 1$ contains infinitely many primes.\n\n**Examples:**\n- There are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+1$ (i.e., 5, 13, 17, 29, 37, ...)\n- There are infinitely many primes of the form $4k+3$ (i.e., 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, ...)\n- There are infinitely many primes of the form $6k+1$ (i.e., 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, ...)",
    "proofStrategy": "Dirichlet's original proof uses analytic methods:\n\n**1. Dirichlet Characters**\nDefine characters chi: (Z/qZ)* -> C* as group homomorphisms, extended to all integers by setting chi(n) = 0 when gcd(n,q) > 1.\n\n**2. Dirichlet L-Functions**\nFor each character chi, define:\n$$L(s, \\chi) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\chi(n)}{n^s}$$\n\nThese converge for Re(s) > 1 and can be analytically continued.\n\n**3. Orthogonality Relations**\nUsing character orthogonality:\n$$\\sum_{\\chi} \\chi(a)^{-1} \\log L(s, \\chi) = \\phi(q) \\sum_{p \\equiv a \\pmod q} \\frac{1}{p^s} + O(1)$$\n\n**4. Non-vanishing at s=1**\nThe key step: prove L(1, chi) is not zero for non-principal chi. As s -> 1+, the left side behaves like log(1/(s-1)), which diverges. This forces the sum over primes to diverge, proving infinitude.\n\n**5. Mathlib Implementation**\nMathlib provides a complete formal proof chain from L-function non-vanishing to the infinitude statement.",

Dirichlet's 1837 proof was revolutionary: it introduced L-functions and character theory, techniques that would later be essential for the Prime Number Theorem (1896) and remain central to modern number theory.\n\nMathlib provides a complete formal proof, building on:\n- Dirichlet character theory in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.DirichletCharacter`\n- L-function construction in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.DirichletContinuation`\n- Non-vanishing results in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.Nonvanishing`\n- The infinitude statement in `Mathlib.NumberTheory.LSeries.PrimesInAP`",
