Let $f(d)$ be the multiplicity of $d$, that is, the number of ordered pairs from $A$ of distance $d$ apart.\n\nIs it true that $k=n-1$ and $\\{f(d_i)\\}=\\{n-1,\\ldots,1\\}$ if and only if $A$ is a set of equidistant points on a line or a circle?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s conjectured that the answer is no, and other such configurations exist.\n\nThis was proved by Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu \\cite{CDL25}, who observed that equidistant points on a short circular arc on a circle of radius $1$, together with the centre, are also an example.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CDL25] F.
