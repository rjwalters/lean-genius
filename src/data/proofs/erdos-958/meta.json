  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #958 asks whether a special distance multiplicity pattern characterizes equidistant points on lines or circles. Erdős himself conjectured NO — other configurations should exist. Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu (2025) proved Erdős was right by finding arc-plus-center counterexamples.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A ⊂ ℝ² be a finite set of size n with k distinct distances and multiplicity function f. Is it true that k = n-1 and {f(dᵢ)} = {n-1,...,1} if and only if A is equidistant on a line or circle? Answer: NO.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Point, distanceSet, multiplicity, multiplicityMultiset. Standard configurations (isEquidistantLine, isEquidistantCircle, isStandardConfig) and the special pattern (hasSpecialPattern) are defined. The FALSE conjecture (OriginalConjecture) is stated. The counterexample (isArcPlusCenter) and Clemen-Dumitrescu-Liu theorem are axiomatized. The summary theorem combines both results.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Special pattern: k = n-1 distances with multiplicities {n-1, ..., 1}",
      "Standard configurations (equidistant on line/circle) satisfy this pattern",
      "Arc + center configuration also satisfies it — the conjecture is FALSE",
      "Erdős correctly predicted other configurations exist",
      "Clemen-Dumitrescu-Liu (2025) proved the disproof with arc+center counterexamples",
      "The center has distance 1 to all arc points, giving the right multiplicity structure"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #958 is SOLVED. The conjectured characterization (special distance pattern ⟺ equidistant on line or circle) is FALSE. Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu (2025) found counterexamples: equidistant points on a short arc of a unit circle plus the center satisfy the pattern but are not standard configurations.",
    "implications": "Understanding which distance patterns characterize point configurations. The special pattern alone does not uniquely determine configuration type. Arc + center is a new family of solutions that Erdős predicted would exist.",
