  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #512 (Littlewood's Conjecture)**\n\n**Origin:**\nLittlewood conjectured that the L¹ norm of exponential sums ∫₀¹ |∑_{n∈A} e(nθ)| dθ is at least c log N for any finite set A ⊂ ℤ with |A| = N. This is a fundamental question in harmonic analysis about how 'flat' trigonometric polynomials can be.\n\n**The Solution (1981):**\nThe conjecture was independently proved by:\n- Konyagin (1981): Using analytic techniques\n- McGehee, Pigno, and Smith (1981): Via Hardy's inequality\n\nThe MPS proof is particularly elegant, reducing the problem to a classical inequality.\n\n**Significance:**\nThe log N bound is essentially optimal - there exist sets achieving L¹ norm ≍ log N. This shows exponential sums cannot be uniformly small across [0,1].",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet A ⊂ ℤ be a finite set with |A| = N, and let e(x) = e^{2πix}.\n\n**Question:** Is ∫₀¹ |∑_{n∈A} e(nθ)| dθ ≫ log N?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\n- Konyagin (1981): First proof\n- McGehee-Pigno-Smith (1981): Proof via Hardy's inequality\n\nThere exists an absolute constant c > 0 such that L¹ ≥ c log N for all finite A.",
