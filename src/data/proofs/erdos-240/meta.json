Indeed, if $P$ is a finite set of primes and $(a_i)$ is the set of integers divisible only by primes in $P$, and $a_{i+1}-a_i$ is bounded, then there exists some $k$ such that $a_{i+1}=a_i+k$ infinitely often, which contradicts P\\'{o}lya's theorem with $f(n)=n(n+k)$.\n\nTijdeman \\cite{Ti73} proved that, if $P$ is a finite set of primes, then\\[a_{i+1}-a_i \\gg \\frac{a_i}{(\\log a_i)^C}\\]for some constant $C>0$ depending on $P$.\n\nTijdeman \\cite{Ti73} resolved this question, proving that, for any $\\epsilon>0$, there exists an infinite set of primes $P$ such that, with $a_i$ defined as above,\\[a_{i+1}-a_i \\gg a_i^{1-\\epsilon}.\\]See also [368].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Po18] P\\'{o}lya, Georg, Zur arithmetischen {U}ntersuchung der {P}olynome.
