  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked this question about tournament domination in 1963. The function f(n) gives the minimum tournament size where every n-set of vertices is dominated by some external vertex. Szekeres & Szekeres (1965) established the lower bound n·2^n. Only f(1)=3, f(2)=7, f(3)=19 are known exactly.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be minimal such that there is a tournament on f(n) vertices such that every set of n vertices is dominated by at least one other vertex. Estimate f(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the tournament and domination definitions, the function f(n), known values f(1), f(2), f(3), Szekeres lower bound, Erdős upper bound, asymptotic behavior, Paley tournaments, quadratic residues, the probabilistic method, and connections to coding theory.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "f(1) = 3 (rock-paper-scissors tournament)",
      "f(2) = 7 (Paley tournament of order 7)",
      "f(3) = 19 (exact value determined computationally)",
      "Lower bound: f(n) ≥ c·n·2^n (Szekeres & Szekeres 1965)",
      "Upper bound: f(n) ≤ C·n²·2^n (Erdős 1963, probabilistic)"

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #902 on tournament domination. The function f(n) gives the minimum tournament size where every n-set is dominated. Known values are f(1)=3, f(2)=7, f(3)=19, with bounds n·2^n ≪ f(n) ≪ n²·2^n.",
