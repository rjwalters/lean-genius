Is it true that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k) \\ll_k n^{3/2},\\]where $H_k$ is the graph on vertices $x,y_1,\\ldots,y_k,z_1,\\ldots,z_{\\binom{k}{2}}$, where $x$ is adjacent to all $y_i$ and each pair of $y_i,y_j$ is adjacent to a unique $z_i$.\n\n\n\nIt is trivial that $\\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k)\\gg n^{3/2}$ since $H_k$ contians a $C_4$ for $k\\geq 3$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er71} claimed a proof for $k=3$.\n\nThe answer is yes, proved by F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{Fu91}, who proved that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k) \\ll (kn)^{3/2}.\\]This was improved to\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k) \\ll kn^{3/2}\\]by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov \\cite{AKS03}.\n\nSince each $H_k$ is 2-degenerate this is a special case of [146].\n\nThe extremal number of the graph $H_k$ with the vertex $x$ omitted is the subject of [1021].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AKS03] Alon, Noga and Krivelevich, Michael and Sudakov, Benny, Tur\\'{a}n numbers of bipartite graphs and related\nRamsey-type questions.
