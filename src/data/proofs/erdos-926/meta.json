  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #926** addresses the extremal number of a specific graph H_k, a fundamental question in extremal combinatorics. The problem originated in Erdős's 1971 paper 'Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis', where he claimed to have proved the k=3 case.\n\nThe graph H_k has a distinctive structure: a central vertex x connected to k vertices y_1,...,y_k, with (k choose 2) additional vertices z_ij, each connecting exactly one pair y_i, y_j. This creates a 'fan-like' structure that naturally contains 4-cycles.\n\nThe problem was fully resolved through work by Füredi (1991), who proved ex(n; H_k) ≪ (kn)^(3/2), and later improved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (2003) to the optimal k·n^(3/2). These results established the tight asymptotic behavior Θ_k(n^(3/2)).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nLet k ≥ 4. Is it true that ex(n; H_k) ≪_k n^(3/2), where H_k is the graph on vertices x, y_1, ..., y_k, z_1, ..., z_(k choose 2), where x is adjacent to all y_i and each pair y_i, y_j is adjacent to a unique z_ij?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\n- Füredi (1991): ex(n; H_k) ≪ (kn)^(3/2)\n- Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (2003): ex(n; H_k) ≪ k·n^(3/2)\n\nThe lower bound ex(n; H_k) ≫ n^(3/2) is trivial since H_k contains C_4.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Structure:** Define H_k's vertex and edge counts using Nat.choose\n\n2. **Verified Examples:** Use native_decide to verify H_4 has 11 vertices, H_5 has 16 vertices\n\n3. **Graph Properties:** Axiomatize that H_k contains C_4, is 2-degenerate, and is bipartite\n\n4. **Lower Bound:** The C_4 containment gives ex(n; H_k) ≥ ex(n; C_4) ≫ n^(3/2) via Kővári-Sós-Turán\n\n5. **Upper Bounds:** Axiomatize Füredi's (kn)^(3/2) and AKS's k·n^(3/2) bounds\n\n6. **Connections:** Link to the 2-degenerate conjecture (Problem 146) and dependent random choice method",

    "implications": "This result confirms the expected behavior for Turán numbers of graphs containing 4-cycles. The techniques developed—particularly dependent random choice—have become fundamental in extremal combinatorics.
