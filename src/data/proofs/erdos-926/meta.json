  "description": "For k ≥ 4, is it true that ex(n; H_k) ≪_k n^(3/2), where H_k is the graph with central vertex x adjacent to k vertices y_1,...,y_k, and (k choose 2) vertices z_ij each adjacent to a unique pair y_i, y_j? Answer: YES. Proved by Füredi (1991) with bound (kn)^(3/2), improved by Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (2003) to k·n^(3/2).",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #926 asks about the Turán number of a specific graph H_k. The problem originates from Erdős's 1971 paper 'Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis'. Erdős claimed a proof for k=3 in that paper. The general case was resolved by Füredi in 1991 and improved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 2003.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 4. Is it true that ex(n; H_k) ≪_k n^(3/2), where H_k is the graph on vertices x, y_1, ..., y_k, z_1, ..., z_(k choose 2), where x is adjacent to all y_i and each pair y_i, y_j is adjacent to a unique z_ij?",
    "proofStrategy": "The lower bound ex(n; H_k) ≫ n^(3/2) is trivial since H_k contains C_4 for k ≥ 3 (the 4-cycle x - y_1 - z_12 - y_2 - x). Füredi (1991) proved ex(n; H_k) ≪ (kn)^(3/2) using probabilistic methods and dependent random choice. Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (2003) improved this to k·n^(3/2) using refined techniques.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "H_k contains C_4 as a subgraph, giving the lower bound via Kővári-Sós-Turán",
      "H_k is 2-degenerate (all z_ij vertices have degree exactly 2)",
      "H_k is bipartite with parts {x} ∪ {z_ij} and {y_1,...,y_k}",
      "The problem is a special case of the 2-degenerate conjecture (Problem 146)",
      "Dependent random choice is the key technique for the upper bound"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #926 is SOLVED. The answer is YES: ex(n; H_k) ≪_k n^(3/2) for all k ≥ 4. The tight bound is Θ_k(n^(3/2)), with the lower bound from C_4 containment and the upper bound from Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov.",
    "implications": "This confirms the expected behavior for 2-degenerate graphs and connects to the broader 2-degenerate conjecture (Problem 146). The techniques developed, particularly dependent random choice, have become fundamental in extremal combinatorics.",
