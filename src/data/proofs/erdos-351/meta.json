  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #351 concerns the additive structure of sequences of the form {p(n) + 1/n : n ∈ ℕ} where p(x) is a polynomial. The notion of 'strong completeness' is a robust form of additive completeness that survives removal of any finite set of elements.\n\nGraham (1963) proved the foundational case p(x) = x, showing that {n + 1/n : n ∈ ℕ} is strongly complete. This was a significant result in additive number theory.\n\nThe case p(x) = x² was resolved much later by combining Graham's work with Alekseyev's 2019 results on partitions into squares. The general question—whether ALL polynomials with positive leading coefficient yield strongly complete sets—remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem (Erdős-Graham)**: Let $p(x) \\in \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ be a polynomial with positive leading coefficient. Is the set\n$$A = \\{p(n) + 1/n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$$\nstrongly complete?\n\n**Definition**: A set $A$ is *strongly complete* if for any finite $B$, the finite sums from $A \\setminus B$ contain all sufficiently large integers.\n\n**Status**:\n- General: OPEN\n- p(x) = x: PROVED (Graham 1963)\n- p(x) = x²: PROVED (Graham + Alekseyev)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by:\n\n1. **Define the image set**: For polynomial P, the set {P(n) + 1/n : n ∈ ℕ}\n2. **Define strong completeness**: For any finite forbidden set B, eventually all integers are representable as sums from A \\ B\n3. **State solved cases as axioms**: Graham's theorem (p=x) and Graham-Alekseyev (p=x²)\n4. **Verify basic properties**: Elements n + 1/n lie strictly between n and n+1 (for n ≥ 2)\n\nThe proofs of the solved cases require deep results from partition theory and are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Strong completeness**: Unlike ordinary completeness (all large integers are sums), strong completeness requires this even after removing any finite set. This is a much stronger property.",
      "**The 1/n perturbation**: Adding 1/n to p(n) creates irrational-like spacing that helps with representability. The terms n + 1/n are 'almost integers' but distinct.",
      "**Graham's partition theorem**: The case p(x) = x involves intricate partition arguments showing redundancy in the sequence.",
      "**The x² case**: Surprisingly hard—required combining Graham's methods with Alekseyev's work on Egyptian fractions with squares.",
      "**Why the general case is hard**: Higher-degree polynomials grow faster, making it harder to ensure the small perturbations 1/n provide enough coverage."
