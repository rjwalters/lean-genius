  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Graham around 1979-1980. Geneson (2019) proved k ≤ 5, and Adenwalla (2022) improved this to k ≤ 4. The exact value of k remains unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "What is the largest k such that in any permutation of ℤ there must exist a monotone k-term arithmetic progression x₁ < x₂ < ... < xₖ?\n\nKnown: 3 ≤ k ≤ 4. The exact value is OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the definition of monotone arithmetic progressions (MAPs) in permutations, state the upper bounds from Geneson and Adenwalla, and explore the gap between known bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A MAP requires both arithmetic progression structure AND monotone ordering in the permutation",
      "The upper bound k ≤ 4 comes from explicit constructions avoiding 5-term MAPs",
      "The lower bound is harder - must show every permutation has 3-MAPs (or 4-MAPs)",
      "The infinite nature of ℤ makes both directions challenging"
