  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about the distinctness of lcm of consecutive integer blocks. The Thue–Siegel theorem implies finiteness for fixed k. Erdős knew only two cross-parameter examples: lcm(5,6,7) = lcm(14,15) = 210 and lcm(4,5,6,7) = lcm(20,21) = 420. A stronger conjecture asserts that consecutive products can rarely share the same prime factor set.",
    "problemStatement": "Let M(n,k) = lcm(n+1,...,n+k). Is M(m,k) ≠ M(n,k) for all m ≥ n+k?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define lcmInterval using Finset.fold with Nat.lcm, consecutiveProduct using Finset.prod, and samePrimeFactors via Nat.primeFactors. The main conjecture and its stronger variant are stated as Prop. Thue–Siegel finiteness is an axiom.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Thue–Siegel theorem gives finiteness for fixed k but not the full conjecture",
      "Only two known cross-parameter examples exist (both involving k=2 on one side)",
      "The stronger prime-factor conjecture would imply the LCM conjecture",
      "Related to Erdős Problems 678, 686, and 850 on consecutive products"
