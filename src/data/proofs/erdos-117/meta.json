  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in connection with group-theoretic Ramsey theory. Pyber (1987) established that h(n) is exponential in n, with the lower bound previously known to Isaacs. The exact growth rate remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let h(n) be the minimum number of Abelian subgroups needed to cover any group where every (n+1)-element subset contains a commuting pair. Estimate h(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the n-commuting property, define the Abelian cover number h(n), and state Pyber's exponential bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The n-commuting property is a Ramsey-type condition on the group",
      "Pyber (1987): c₁^n < h(n) < c₂^n for constants 1 < c₁ < c₂",
      "h(1) = 1 since the n-commuting property with n=1 implies G is Abelian",
      "The gap between c₁ and c₂ is open — is there a single exponential base?",
      "Lower bound was independently known to Isaacs"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #117 asks to estimate the Abelian covering number h(n). Pyber showed it is exponential: c₁^n < h(n) < c₂^n. Narrowing the gap between c₁ and c₂ remains open.",
    "implications": "A precise estimate would illuminate the structure of groups with strong local commutativity conditions.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact exponential base of h(n)?",
      "Is h(n) = Θ(c^n) for a single constant c?",
      "What are the extremal groups achieving h(n)?",
      "Can the upper or lower bound constants be improved?"
