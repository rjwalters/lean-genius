    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #718: Subdivisions of Complete Graphs**\n\nThis problem concerns forced substructures in dense graphs, a central theme in extremal graph theory.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Dirac (1960): Proved 2n-2 edges forces a K₄ subdivision; conjectured 3n-5 forces K₅\n- Mader (1967): Proved exponential bound 2^{r choose 2} · n edges suffices for Kᵣ subdivision\n- Erdős, Hajnal, and Mader: Conjectured quadratic bound Cr²n suffices\n- Komlós-Szemerédi (1996): Proved the conjecture\n- Bollobás-Thomason (1996): Independent proof, also characterized highly linked graphs\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nA subdivision of a graph H replaces each edge with a path. A subdivision of Kᵣ (the complete graph on r vertices) is called a topological Kᵣ. The question asks: how many edges force a topological Kᵣ?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nIs there some constant C > 0 such that any graph on n vertices with ≥ Cr²n edges contains a subdivision of Kᵣ?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nProved independently by:\n- Komlós and Szemerédi (1996): \"Topological cliques in graphs II\"\n- Bollobás and Thomason (1996): \"Highly linked graphs\"\n\nThe quadratic bound Cr²n is optimal up to the constant C.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:**\n   - IsSubdivisionOfKr: r branch vertices with internally disjoint paths between all pairs\n   - ContainsSubdivisionOfKr: graph contains a Kᵣ subdivision as subgraph\n   - MaderConjecture: ∃ C > 0 such that Cr²n edges forces Kᵣ subdivision\n\n2. **Historical Axioms:**\n   - Dirac 1960: 2n-2 edges → K₄ subdivision\n   - Mader 1967: 2^{r(r-1)/2} · n edges → Kᵣ subdivision (exponential)\n   - Komlós-Szemerédi/Bollobás-Thomason 1996: Cr²n edges → Kᵣ subdivision (quadratic)\n\n3. **Related Results:**\n   - Highly linked graphs: Ckn edges makes a graph k-linked\n   - Minor vs subdivision: subdivision is stronger than minor\n\n4. **Main Theorem:** erdos_718_solved proves MaderConjecture is true",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Quadratic Growth:** The edge bound Cr²n is quadratic in r, vastly improving the exponential 2^{r choose 2} bound",
      "**Two Independent Proofs:** Both Komlós-Szemerédi and Bollobás-Thomason found proofs in the same year using different methods",
      "**Highly Linked Graphs:** Bollobás-Thomason also proved dense graphs are highly linked (k disjoint paths between any 2k vertices)",
      "**Subdivision vs Minor:** A subdivision is stronger than a minor - subdivisions preserve topological structure",
      "**Optimal Order:** The quadratic bound is best possible up to the constant; examples show linear bounds fail"
