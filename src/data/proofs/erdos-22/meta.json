  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Conjectured by Bollobás and Erdős in 1976 as part of their systematic study of Ramsey-Turán problems. They proved existence of K₄-free graphs with (1/8 + o(1))n² edges and small independence number. Fox, Loh, and Zhao resolved the conjecture in 2015.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $\\epsilon > 0$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. Is there a K₄-free graph on $n$ vertices with $\\geq n^2/8$ edges such that the largest independent set has size at most $\\epsilon n$? Equivalently: Is $\\mathrm{rt}(n; 4, \\epsilon n) \\geq n^2/8$?",
    "proofStrategy": "Fox-Loh-Zhao use pseudorandom Cayley graph constructions over finite fields. They show that random subgraphs of certain algebraic graphs achieve the desired properties: K₄-free, ~n²/8 edges, and independence number only (log log n)^(3/2)/(log n)^(1/2) · n.",

      "Turán graph T(n,3) has n²/3 edges but linear independence number n/3",
      "Ramsey-Turán asks: can we keep many edges with sublinear independence?",
      "The answer is yes, but we lose edges: n²/8 vs n²/3",
      "The bound n²/8 corresponds to Ramsey-Turán density ρ₄ = 1/4",
      "Pseudorandom constructions achieve much better than εn independence"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Fox, Loh, and Zhao (2015) proved that K₄-free graphs can have ≥ n²/8 edges with independence number only (log log n)^(3/2)/(log n)^(1/2) · n, which is much smaller than any εn. This resolves the Bollobás-Erdős conjecture affirmatively.",
    "implications": "The result establishes ρ₄ = 1/4 as the Ramsey-Turán density for K₄, showing the precise tradeoff between edge density and independence number in K₄-free graphs.",
