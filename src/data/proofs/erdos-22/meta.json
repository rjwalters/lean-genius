    "problemStatement": "Let $\\epsilon>0$ and $n$ be sufficiently large depending on $\\epsilon$. Is there a graph on $n$ vertices with $\\geq n^2/8$ many edges which contains no $K_4$ such that the largest independent set has size at most $\\epsilon n$? In other words, if $\\mathrm{rt}(n;k,\\ell)$ is the Ramsey-Turán number then is it true that (for sufficiently large $n$)\\[\\mathrm{rt}(n; 4,\\epsilon n)\\geq n^2/8?\\]Conjectured by Bollobás and Erdős [BoEr76], who proved the existence of such a graph with $(1/8+o(1))n^2$ many edges. Solved by Fox, Loh, and Zhao [FLZ15], who proved that for every $n\\geq 1$ there exists a graph on $n$ vertices with $\\geq n^2/8$ many edges, containing no $K_4$, whose largest independent set has size at most\\[ \\ll \\frac{(\\log\\log n)^{3/2}}{(\\log n)^{1/2}}n.\\]See also [615].
