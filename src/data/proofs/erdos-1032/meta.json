  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this question over 20 years before 1993. Dirac constructed 6-chromatic critical graphs with δ > n/2, and Simonovits–Toft achieved δ ≫ n^{1/3} for 4-chromatic critical graphs. The gap between n^{1/3} and linear remains open. Toft conjectured that 4-chromatic critical graphs have ≥ (5/3+o(1))n edges.",
    "problemStatement": "Do there exist 4-chromatic critical graphs on n vertices with minimum degree ≫ n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatises graph properties (vertex count, min degree, chromatic number, edges) and k-chromatic criticality. Known constructions and Toft's edge conjecture are stated. The main conjecture asks for linear minimum degree.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "k-chromatic critical: χ = k and every edge removal reduces χ",
      "Dirac: 6-chromatic critical with δ > n/2 (optimal)",
      "Simonovits–Toft: 4-chromatic critical with δ ≫ n^{1/3}",
      "The gap between n^{1/3} and n is wide; linear δ is the target"
