The answer is no for $G=C_6$, the cycle on 6 vertices. Morris and Saxton \\cite{MoSa16} have proved there are at least\\[2^{(1+c)\\mathrm{ex}(n;C_6)}\\]such graphs for infinitely many $n$, for some constant $c>0$. It is still possible (and conjectured by Morris and Saxton) that the weaker bound of\\[2^{O(\\mathrm{ex}(n;G))}\\]holds for all $G$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EFR86] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Frankl, P. and R\\\"{o}dl, V., The asymptotic number of graphs not containing a fixed subgraph and a problem for hypergraphs having no exponent.
