  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects Turán-type extremal graph theory with graph enumeration. The question asks whether forbidding a subgraph H limits the number of labeled graphs to roughly 2^{ex(n;H)}. Erdős, Frankl, and Rödl (1986) proved this for non-bipartite H. Morris and Saxton (2016) found a striking counterexample: for the 6-cycle C_6, there are superpolynomially more C_6-free graphs than the conjecture predicts.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that the number of graphs on n vertices which do not contain G is at most 2^{(1+o(1))ex(n;G)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines subgraph containment, bipartiteness, and asymptotic bounds (HasOptimalBound, ExceedsOptimalBound). The Erdős-Frankl-Rödl theorem is stated as an axiom for non-bipartite graphs. The Morris-Saxton counterexample is axiomatized showing C_6 violates the bound. The main theorem derives that the conjecture is false in general.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #59, which asks whether the count of H-free graphs is bounded by 2^{(1+o(1))ex(n;H)}. The problem is DISPROVED: Morris and Saxton (2016) showed the 6-cycle C_6 violates this bound, while Erdős-Frankl-Rödl (1986) proved it holds for non-bipartite graphs.",
    "implications": "The resolution reveals a fundamental dichotomy between bipartite and non-bipartite forbidden subgraphs. For non-bipartite H, the structure is rigid enough that Turán numbers essentially determine the count. Bipartite forbidden subgraphs allow more flexibility, leading to superpolynomially more graphs.",
