    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1125**\n\nThis problem originates from functional analysis and the study of generalized convexity. The inequality 2f(x) ≤ f(x+h) + f(x+2h) is a one-sided discrete convexity condition.\n\n**History:**\n- Kemperman (1969) posed the problem and proved YES if f is measurable\n- Erdős included it in his Scottish Book problems, writing \"if it were my problem I would offer $500 for it\"\n- Laczkovich (1984) proved YES unconditionally - no measurability needed\n\n**Context:** Non-measurable functions can have exotic properties (e.g., additive non-linear functions via Axiom of Choice). The surprise is that Kemperman's inequality is strong enough to force monotonicity even without measurability.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet f : ℝ → ℝ satisfy\n  2f(x) ≤ f(x+h) + f(x+2h)\nfor every x ∈ ℝ and h > 0.\n\n**Question:** Must f be monotonic?\n\n**Kemperman (1969):** YES if f is measurable.\n\n**Laczkovich (1984):** YES unconditionally.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Kemperman Inequality:** Define satisfiesKemperman f as the functional inequality\n\n2. **Monotonicity:** Define isMonotonic as non-decreasing OR non-increasing\n\n3. **Equivalent Formulation:** Show 2f(x) ≤ f(x+h) + f(x+2h) is equivalent to bounding jumps\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - Kemperman 1969: measurable case as axiom\n   - Laczkovich 1984: general case as axiom\n\n5. **Examples:** Constants, linear functions, x² all satisfy the inequality\n\n**Why Axioms:** Laczkovich's proof uses subtle order-theoretic and combinatorial arguments beyond current Mathlib.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1125 was solved by Laczkovich in 1984. If f : ℝ → ℝ satisfies 2f(x) ≤ f(x+h) + f(x+2h) for all x and h > 0, then f must be monotonic - no measurability assumption needed. This resolved a problem Erdős valued at $500.",
