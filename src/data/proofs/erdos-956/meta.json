That is, the maximal $m$ such that there is a compact convex set $C\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ and a set $X$ of size $n$ such that all $(C+x)_{x\\in X}$ are disjoint and there are $m$ pairs $x_1,x_2\\in X$ such that\\[\\delta(C+x_1,C+x_2)=1.\\]Determine $h(n)$ - in particular, prove that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $h(n)>n^{1+c}$ for all large $n$.\n\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Pach \\cite{ErPa90}, who proved that $h(n) \\ll n^{4/3}$. They also consider the related function where we consider $n$ disjoint convex sets (not necessarily translates), for which they give an upper bound of $\\ll n^{7/5}$.\n\nIt is trivial that $h(n)\\geq f(n)$, where $f(n)$ is the maximal number of unit distances determined by $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ (see [90]).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErPa90] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Pach, J., Variations on the theme of repeated distances.
