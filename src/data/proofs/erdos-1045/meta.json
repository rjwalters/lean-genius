Is it maximised by taking the $z_i$ to be the vertices of a regular polygon?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian \\cite{EHP58}, who proved that, for any monic polynomial $f$, if $\\{ z: \\lvert f(z)\\rvert <1\\}$ is connected and $f$ has roots $z_1,\\ldots,z_n$ then $\\prod_{i\\neq j}\\lvert z_i-z_j\\rvert <n^n$.\n\nThe value of $\\Delta$ when the $z_i$ are the vertices of a regular polygon is $n^n$ when $n$ is even and\\[\\cos(\\pi/2n)^{-n(n-1)}n^n \\sim e^{\\pi^2/8}n^n\\]when $n$ is odd.\n\nPommerenke \\cite{Po61} proved that $\\Delta \\leq 2^{O(n)}n^n$ for all $z_i$ with $\\lvert z_i-z_j\\rvert \\leq 2$.\n\nHu and Tang (see the comments) found examples when $n=4$ and $n=6$ that show that vertices of a regular polygon do not maximise $\\Delta$. Cambie (also in the comments) showed that, in general, the vertices of a regular polygon are not a maximiser for all even $n\\geq 4$.\n\nThere is a lot of discussion of this problem in the comments. It is now known that, for even $n$,\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\max \\Delta}{n^n}\\geq C\\]for some $C>0$. This was proved with $C\\approx 1.0378$ by Sothanaphan \\cite{So25}. An alternative construction by Cambie, Dong, and Tang (see the comments by Stijn Cambie) achieves $C\\approx 1.304457$ for $6\\mid n$, and $C\\approx 1.26853$ for all even $n$.\n\n\nIt remains possible that the regular polygon is a maximiser for odd $n$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHP58] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Herzog, F. and Piranian, G., Metric properties of polynomials.
