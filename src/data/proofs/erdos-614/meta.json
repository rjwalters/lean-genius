    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #614 is an extremal graph theory problem asking for the minimum number of edges needed in a graph to guarantee that every sufficiently large induced subgraph has high maximum degree.\n\nThe problem combines ideas from Turán-type extremal theory (minimizing edges while forcing structure) with a Ramsey-theoretic flavor (guaranteeing properties in ALL subsets of a given size).\n\nThe problem was referenced in [FRS97] and remains open. No closed-form formula for f(n,k) is known, and even the asymptotic behavior is not fully understood.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n,k)$ be the minimal number of edges such that there exists a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $f(n,k)$ edges where every set of $k+2$ vertices induces a subgraph with maximum degree at least $k$.\n\n**Problem:** Determine $f(n,k)$.\n\n**Status:** OPEN\n\nThe problem asks: how sparse can a graph be while still guaranteeing that every moderately-sized induced subgraph has high local connectivity?",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines:\n\n1. **Basic graph concepts**: Degree, maximum degree, induced subgraphs\n2. **Property P(k)**: Every (k+2)-subset has induced max degree ≥ k\n3. **The function f(n,k)**: Minimum edges for property P(k) on n vertices\n4. **Basic bounds**: Lower bounds from density, upper bound from complete graph\n5. **Special cases**: f(n,0) = 0, f(n, n-2) = complete graph\n6. **Monotonicity**: f is non-decreasing in both n and k\n\nThe main theorems establish the framework; the exact value of f(n,k) remains unknown.",
