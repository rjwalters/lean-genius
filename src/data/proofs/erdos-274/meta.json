(i.e. each element is contained in exactly one of the cosets)\n\n\n\nA question of Herzog and Sch\\\"{onheim}, who conjectured more generally that if $G$ is any (not necessarily finite) group and $a_1G_1,\\ldots,a_kG_k$ are finitely many cosets of subgroups of $G$ with distinct indices $[G:G_i]$ then the $a_iG_i$ cannot form a partition of $G$.\n\nThis conjecture was proved in the case when all the $G_i$ are subnormal in $G$ by Sun \\cite{Su04}. In particular if $G$ is abelian (which was the special case asked about in \\cite{Er77c} and \\cite{ErGr80}) the answer to the original question is no.\n\nMargolis and Schnabel \\cite{MaSc19} proved this conjecture for all groups $G$ of size $<1440$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er77c] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Problems and results on combinatorial number theory.
