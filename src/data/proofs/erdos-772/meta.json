Or even $H_k(n) > n^{1/2+c}$ for some constant $c>0$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er84d} proved that\\[H_k(n) \\ll n^{2/3}\\](where the implied constant is absolute). The lower bound $H_k(n)\\gg n^{1/2}$ follows from the fact that any set of size $n$ contains a Sidon set of size $\\gg n^{1/2}$ (see [530]).\n\nThe answer is yes, and in fact\\[H_k(n) \\gg_k n^{2/3},\\]proved by Alon and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{AlEr85}. We sketch their proof as follows: take a random subset $A'\\subset A$, including each $n\\in A'$ with probability $\\asymp n^{-1/3}$. The number of non-trivial additive quadruples in $A$ is $\\ll n^2$ and hence only $\\ll n^{2/3}$ non-trivial additive quadruples remain in $A'$. Since the size of the random subset is $\\gg n^{2/3}$, all of the remaining non-trivial additive quadruples can be removed by removing at most $\\lvert A'\\rvert/2$ (choosing the constants suitably).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AlEr85] Alon, Noga and Erd\\H{o}s, P., An application of graph theory to additive number theory.
