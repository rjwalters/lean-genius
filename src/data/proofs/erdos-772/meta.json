    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #772: Sidon Sets in Bounded Convolution Sets**\n\nThis problem connects two important concepts in additive combinatorics: Sidon sets (where all pairwise sums are distinct) and sets with bounded convolution (where no sum is represented too many times).\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős (1984): Posed the problem and proved H_k(n) ≪ n^{2/3}\n- Alon-Erdős (1985): Proved the matching lower bound H_k(n) ≫_k n^{2/3}\n- The basic lower bound H_k(n) ≫ √n follows from Problem #530\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nLet H_k(n) be the maximum r such that any set A ⊆ ℕ with |A| = n and bounded convolution ‖1_A ∗ 1_A‖_∞ ≤ k contains a Sidon subset of size at least r. Erdős asked whether H_k(n)/√n → ∞, and whether H_k(n) > n^{1/2+c} for some c > 0.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nLet $k \\geq 1$ and $H_k(n)$ be the maximal $r$ such that if $A \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ has $|A| = n$ and $\\|1_A \\ast 1_A\\|_\\infty \\leq k$, then $A$ contains a Sidon set of size at least $r$.\n\nIs it true that $H_k(n)/n^{1/2} \\to \\infty$? Or even $H_k(n) > n^{1/2+c}$ for some constant $c > 0$?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nAlon and Erdős (1985) proved:\n- Upper bound: $H_k(n) \\ll n^{2/3}$ (Erdős 1984, absolute constant)\n- Lower bound: $H_k(n) \\gg_k n^{2/3}$ (Alon-Erdős 1985, constant depends on k)\n\nThus $H_k(n) = \\Theta(n^{2/3})$, and the answer is YES with $c = 1/6$.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Sidon Sets:** Define IsSidon as the property that all pairwise sums are distinct, equivalently {a,b} = {c,d} whenever a+b = c+d.\n\n2. **Bounded Convolution:** Define representation count r_A(n) and the bounded convolution property ‖1_A ∗ 1_A‖_∞ ≤ k.\n\n3. **The Function H_k:** Define as supremum over Sidon subset sizes in qualifying sets.\n\n4. **Upper Bound:** Axiomatize Erdős's 1984 result H_k(n) ≪ n^{2/3}.\n\n5. **Basic Lower Bound:** Use the fact that any set has a Sidon subset of size ≫ √n.\n\n6. **Optimal Lower Bound:** Axiomatize Alon-Erdős (1985) using probabilistic method.\n\n7. **Probabilistic Construction:** Sample with probability ∼n^{-1/3}, then remove remaining quadruples.\n\n8. **Summary:** Combine to show H_k(n) = Θ(n^{2/3}).",
