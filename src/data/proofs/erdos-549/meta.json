    "historicalContext": "Erdős conjectured that for any tree T that is bipartite with k vertices in one class and 2k vertices in the other, the Ramsey number R(T) = 4k - 1. This would have been a beautiful exact formula for a large class of trees.\n\nNorin, Sun, and Zhao disproved this by constructing a counterexample: the 'double star' formed by connecting the centers of a k-star and a 2k-star. This tree has R(T) ≥ 4.2k, exceeding 4k - 1 for large k. Flag algebra methods give an upper bound of 4.21526k, so the true constant is tightly bounded.",
    "problemStatement": "**Original Conjecture:**\nFor a tree T bipartite with parts of size k and 2k:\nR(T) = 4k - 1\n\n**Resolution: FALSE**\n\nThe double star (S_k and S_{2k} with connected centers) satisfies:\n- R(double star) ≥ (4.2 - o(1))k\n- R(double star) ≤ (4.21526 + o(1))k\n\n**Special Cases Still True:**\n- Bounded degree trees\n- Brooms (path + star)\n- Certain star-path combinations",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines `IsTree` and `BipartiteTree k` structure\n2. Defines `RamseyNumber H` for graphs H\n3. Constructs `starGraph n` and `doubleStar k`\n4. States the original conjecture `erdosConjecture549`\n5. States Norin-Sun-Zhao counterexample and bounds\n6. States flag algebra upper bound\n7. States special cases where conjecture holds\n8. Proves the conjecture is false: `¬erdosConjecture549`",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Counterexample Structure:** The double star has high-degree vertices (the star centers), which enables denser Ramsey colorings.",
      "**Tight Bounds:** 4.2k ≤ R(double star) ≤ 4.21526k — the constant is known to 3 decimal places!",
      "**Bounded Degree Saves Conjecture:** For trees with max degree Δ, the original formula R(T) = 4k - 1 still holds.",
      "**Lower Bound Always Holds:** R(T) ≥ 4k - 1 for ALL bipartite (k, 2k) trees — the conjecture only fails as an upper bound.",
      "**Flag Algebras:** Modern semi-definite programming methods (flag algebras) provide the upper bound."

The conjecture remains true for special cases like bounded-degree trees and brooms. The formalization captures the counterexample, both bounds, and the special cases.",
