What about a $k$th power?\n\n\n\nA question of Roth, Erd\\H{o}s, S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy, and S\\'{o}s \\cite{ESS89} (according to some reports, although in \\cite{Er80c} Erd\\H{o}s claims this arose in a conversation with Silverman in 1977). Erd\\H{o}s, S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy, and S\\'{o}s \\cite{ESS89} proved this for $2$ or $3$ colours.\n\nIn other words, if $G$ is the infinite graph on $\\mathbb{N}$ where we connect $m,n$ by an edge if and only if $n+m$ is a square, then is the chromatic number of $G$ equal to $\\aleph_0$?\n\nThis is true, as proved by Khalfalah and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{KhSz06}, who in fact prove the general result with $x+y=z^2$ replaced by $x+y=f(z)$ for any non-constant $f(z)\\in \\mathbb{Z}[z]$ such that $2\\mid f(z)$ for some $z\\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSee also [438].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ESS89] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and S\\'{a}rk\\\"ozy, A. and S\\'{o}s, V.
