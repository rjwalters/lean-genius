    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses density arguments: if we partition ℤ, the sum Σ 1/nᵢ must equal 1. Combined with LCM constraints, this leads to a contradiction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For an exact covering, the sum of densities Σ 1/nᵢ = 1",
      "The LCM of the moduli creates constraints that cannot be satisfied",
