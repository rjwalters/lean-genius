It is trivial that $G$ can be made triangle-free after removing at most $3k$ edges. The examples of $K_4$ and $K_5$ show that $2k$ would be best possible.\n\nThe trivial bound of $\\leq 3k$ was improved to $\\leq (3-\\frac{3}{23}+o(1))k$ by Haxell \\cite{Ha99}.\n\nKahn and Park \\cite{KaPa22} have proved this is true for random graphs.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ha99] Haxell, P.
