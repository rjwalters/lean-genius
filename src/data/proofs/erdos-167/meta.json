    "historicalContext": "Tuza conjectured in 1981 that τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G) where τ is the minimum triangle cover and ν is the maximum triangle packing. The trivial bound is 3ν; Haxell-Kohayakawa (1998) improved this to 2.87ν. The conjecture is proven for K₄-free graphs, planar graphs, and random graphs.",
    "problemStatement": "Let ν(G) be the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in G, and τ(G) the minimum number of edges to remove to make G triangle-free. Tuza's Conjecture: τ(G) ≤ 2·ν(G). K₄ and K₅ show 2 is best possible.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines triangles, edge-disjoint packings, and triangle covers. Aristotle verified three key theorems: (1) trivial_bound: τ ≤ 3ν via constructing a cover from a maximum packing, (2) k4_tight and k5_tight: K₄ and K₅ achieve τ = 2ν exactly, verified by native_decide.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Trivial bound: remove one edge per triangle in maximum packing → τ ≤ 3ν",
      "K₄ achieves equality in Tuza: ν(K₄) = 1, τ(K₄) = 2",
      "K₅ also achieves equality: ν(K₅) = 2, τ(K₅) = 4",
      "Best general bound: τ ≤ (3 - 3/23)ν ≈ 2.87ν (Haxell-Kohayakawa)",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #167 (Tuza's Conjecture) is PARTIALLY SOLVED. This formalization includes three Aristotle-verified theorems: the trivial 3ν bound and tightness examples K₄ and K₅. The conjecture τ ≤ 2ν remains open for general graphs.",
    "implications": "Tuza's conjecture connects triangle packing (combinatorial optimization) with covering (vertex/edge cover theory). The fractional version being true suggests the integral conjecture may hold with better rounding techniques.",

      "Does τ(G) ≤ 2ν(G) hold for all graphs?",
