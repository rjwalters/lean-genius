    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Faudree, and Sós conjectured that graphs with small Ramsey numbers (no large cliques or independent sets) must have induced subgraphs with many distinct degrees. This connects degree diversity to Ramsey-theoretic properties.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize vertex degrees, distinct degree counts, Ramsey graph properties, induced subgraphs, the original conjecture, the Bukh-Sudakov solution, the JKLY strengthening, optimality considerations, and connections to Ramsey theory.",
