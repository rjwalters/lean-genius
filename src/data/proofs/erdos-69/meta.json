  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #69 asks about the irrationality of a sum involving the prime omega function ω(n), which counts distinct prime divisors. Erdős (1948) had proved that ∑d(n)/2^n is irrational, where d(n) is the divisor function.\n\nThe breakthrough came from Tao's observation that ∑ω(n)/2^n equals ∑1/(2^p-1) over primes p. This identity transforms the problem into a special case of Problem 257. Pratt (2024) proved irrationality conditional on a prime k-tuples conjecture. Finally, Tao and Teräväinen (2025) proved it unconditionally using advanced analytic number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Is\n$$\\sum_{n \\geq 2} \\frac{\\omega(n)}{2^n}$$\nirrational, where $\\omega(n)$ counts the distinct prime divisors of $n$?\n\n**Answer:** Yes, proved by Tao-Teräväinen (2025).",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof has two key steps:\n\n1. **Tao's Identity**: By swapping the order of summation, ∑ω(n)/2^n = ∑_p ∑_{p|n} 1/2^n = ∑_p 1/(2^p-1). The inner sum is a geometric series.\n\n2. **Irrationality**: The sum ∑1/(2^p-1) is irrational by Tao-Teräväinen's 2025 result, which uses deep analytic number theory (correlations of arithmetic functions).\n\nWe formalize the identity with proof and state the irrationality as an axiom.",

      "**Geometric series**: For each prime p, summing 1/2^(pk) over k≥1 gives 1/(2^p-1)",
