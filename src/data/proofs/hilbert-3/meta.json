  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Hilbert's 3rd Problem (1900) asked whether any two polyhedra of equal volume can be cut into congruent pieces. Max Dehn solved this in 1900 - just months after Hilbert posed it - by introducing the Dehn invariant.\n\nThis was the first of Hilbert's 23 problems to be completely resolved.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question:** Given two polyhedra of equal volume, can one always be cut into finitely many polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into the other?\n\n**Answer (Dehn 1900):** No! The Dehn invariant provides an obstruction.",
    "proofStrategy": "The Dehn invariant D(P) lives in the tensor product R tensor (R/pi*Q).\n\n1. Define D(P) = sum over edges of length(e) tensor dihedral_angle(e)\n2. Prove D is additive under dissection\n3. Compute D(cube) = 0\n4. Compute D(tetrahedron) != 0\n5. Conclude they cannot be scissors congruent",

      "In 2D, all polygons of equal area ARE scissors congruent (Bolyai-Gerwien)",
