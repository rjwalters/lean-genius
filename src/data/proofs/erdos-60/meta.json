  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is a supersaturation problem conjectured by Erdős and Simonovits. Once a graph exceeds the Turán number ex(n; C_4), it must contain at least one 4-cycle. The question asks for a quantitative bound: how many 4-cycles are forced? The conjecture is that at least Ω(n^{1/2}) copies appear. Remarkably, Erdős and Simonovits couldn't even prove that ≥ 2 copies are guaranteed.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every graph on n vertices with > ex(n; C_4) edges contain ≫ n^{1/2} many copies of C_4?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines 4-cycle copies as ordered 4-tuples, the Turán number ex(n; C_4) with its asymptotic bounds, and the supersaturation conjecture. Partial results (He-Ma-Yang 2021 for projective plane orders) are axiomatized. The two-copies conjecture is stated as a weaker open problem.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #60, an OPEN supersaturation problem asking whether exceeding ex(n; C_4) forces Ω(n^{1/2}) copies of C_4. The conjecture remains unproven in general, with partial results for projective plane orders (He-Ma-Yang 2021).",
    "implications": "Supersaturation problems quantify how 'far' a graph is from being extremal. For C_4, the conjectured n^{1/2} bound would be tight: polarity graphs show you can be arbitrarily close to ex(n; C_4) with zero 4-cycles.",
