  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdos Problem #358 was posed in 1977 [Er77c] and revisited in Erdos-Graham (1980). It asks a deceptively simple question about how many ways an integer can be written as a sum of consecutive terms from a fixed sequence.\n\nErdos himself remarked: \"This problem can perhaps be rightly criticized as being artificial and in the backwater of Mathematics but it seems very strange and attractive to me.\"\n\nThe problem connects to classical results about sums of consecutive integers (which relate to odd divisors) and to the Erdos-Moser conjecture (1963) about consecutive prime sums.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet A = {a_1 < a_2 < ...} be an infinite sequence of integers. Let f(n) count solutions to n = sum_{i=u}^{v} a_i (sum of consecutive terms).\n\n**Question 1 (Strong):** Does there exist A with f(n) -> infinity as n -> infinity?\n\n**Question 2 (Weak):** Does there exist A with f(n) >= 2 for all sufficiently large n?\n\nBoth questions remain **OPEN**.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Sequences:** Define IntSequence as strictly increasing integer sequences\n\n2. **Counting Function:** f(n) = #{(u,v) : u <= v and sum_{i=u}^{v} a_i = n}\n\n3. **Natural Numbers Case:** When A = {1,2,3,...}, f(n) = number of odd divisors\n\n4. **Classical Result:** n = sum of >=2 consecutive positives iff n != 2^k\n\n5. **Prime Case:** Erdos-Moser conjecture about consecutive prime sums\n\n6. **Main Conjectures:** Strong (f -> infinity) and Weak (f >= 2 eventually) forms",

      "**Prime Sums:** Even the positive density of prime consecutive sums is unknown",

    "summary": "Erdos Problem #358 asks whether there exists an infinite sequence A where f(n) - the count of consecutive sum representations - tends to infinity, or even just exceeds 1 for all large n. Both questions remain OPEN. For natural numbers, f(n) equals the odd divisor count. For primes, even positive density is unknown.",
    "implications": "This problem reveals how little we understand about the structure of consecutive sums from infinite sequences. Despite the natural numbers case being completely understood (odd divisors), finding a sequence with f(n) -> infinity or even f(n) >= 2 eventually remains elusive.",
