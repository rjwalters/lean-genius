  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from J.E. Littlewood's 1966 work on polynomials with ±1 coefficients (Littlewood polynomials). He conjectured that 'flat' examples exist—polynomials where |P(z)| stays close to √n uniformly on the unit circle.\n\nThe conjecture remained open for over 50 years. In 2019, Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba proved that flat Littlewood polynomials exist, resolving the conjecture. Their paper 'Flat Littlewood Polynomials Exist' appeared in the Annals of Mathematics (2020).\n\nThe result is remarkable: despite the severe constraint of ±1 coefficients, the magnitude can be controlled to stay within constant factors of √n everywhere on the unit circle. This matches the 'random' behavior predicted by the central limit theorem.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question**: For all large $n$, does there exist a polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ with coefficients $\\pm 1$ such that $\\sqrt{n} \\ll |P(z)| \\ll \\sqrt{n}$ for all $|z| = 1$?\n\n**Answer**: YES\n\nA **Littlewood polynomial** has all coefficients in $\\{-1, +1\\}$. A Littlewood polynomial is **flat** if $c_1\\sqrt{n} \\leq |P(z)| \\leq c_2\\sqrt{n}$ for all $|z| = 1$, where $c_1, c_2 > 0$ are absolute constants.\n\n**Theorem** (BBMST 2019): Flat Littlewood polynomials exist for every $n \\geq 2$.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem and main result:\n\n1. **IsLittlewoodPolynomial**: Define when a polynomial has ±1 coefficients\n2. **IsFlatOnUnitCircle**: Define flatness as magnitude bounded by c₁√n and c₂√n\n3. **Erdos228Question**: The existence question for all large n\n4. **bbmst_theorem**: Axiomatize the main result\n5. **bbmst_explicit**: Equivalent explicit formulation with constants\n6. **ErdosHaymanQuestion**: Related problem on maximum exceeding √n\n\nThe theorem itself requires sophisticated probabilistic and harmonic analysis techniques beyond Mathlib.",

      "**Why √n?**: For random ±1 sums, the central limit theorem predicts magnitude ~√n. The question asks if this 'average' behavior can be achieved deterministically.",
