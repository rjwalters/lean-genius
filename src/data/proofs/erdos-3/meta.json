  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #3 is one of the most important problems in additive combinatorics. It asks whether sets with 'large' reciprocal sum must contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\n\nThe problem is deeply connected to Szemerédi's theorem (1975), which earned Szemerédi the Abel Prize. Erdős believed solving Problem #3 would lead to proving the primes contain arbitrarily long APs - this was eventually achieved by Green-Tao (2008) through different methods.\n\nThe $5,000 prize remains unclaimed despite 80+ years of progress.",
    "problemStatement": "**Conjecture (Erdős):** If A ⊆ ℕ has Σ(1/n : n ∈ A) = ∞, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\n\n**Equivalent formulation:** For all k ≥ 3, is r_k(N) = o(N / log N)?\n\nHere r_k(N) is the maximum size of a subset of {1,...,N} without a k-term arithmetic progression.\n\n**Status:** OPEN. The best bounds fall short of the required threshold.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `ArithProg a d k`: the k-term AP {a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(k-1)d}\n2. `ContainsAP A k`: set A contains some k-term AP\n3. `rothNumber k N`: maximum AP-free subset size (r_k(N))\n4. `HasDivergentSum A`: the reciprocal sum diverges\n5. `Erdos3Conjecture`: the main statement\n\nWe axiomatize the major milestones:\n- Szemerédi's theorem: r_k(N) = o(N)\n- Gowers' bounds: r_k(N) ≪ N / (log log N)^c\n- Kelley-Meka (2023): r_3(N) ≪ N / exp((log N)^{1/11})\n- Leng-Sah-Sawhney (2024): current best general bound",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The gap:** Current bounds give r_k(N) = o(N / exp((log log N)^c)), but we need o(N / log N). This gap seems insurmountable with current methods.",
      "**Szemerédi → Green-Tao:** Szemerédi's theorem shows positive density implies APs. Green-Tao extended this to primes (density 0 but pseudorandom).",
      "**Construction vs bound:** Behrend (1946) gives AP-free sets of size N/exp(√log N). The conjecture asks if this can reach N/log N.",
      "**Kelley-Meka breakthrough:** Their 2023 result r_3(N) ≪ N/exp((log N)^{1/11}) was a massive improvement, but still far from the goal.",
      "**Why $5,000?** Erdős valued this highly because it bridges additive combinatorics, number theory, and harmonic analysis."
