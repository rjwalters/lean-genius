Are there integers $1<n_1<\\cdots<n_k$, each the product of two distinct primes, such that\\[\\frac{a}{b}=\\frac{1}{n_1}+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{n_k}?\\]\n\n\n\nFor $n_i$ the product of three distinct primes, this is true when $b=1$, as proved by Butler, Erd\\H{o}s and Graham \\cite{BEG15} (this paper is perhaps Erd\\H{o}s' last paper, appearing 19 years after his death).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BEG15] Butler, Steve and Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Graham, Ron, Egyptian fractions with each denominator having three distinct\nprime divisors.
