There are infinitely many $n$ such that $P(n)>P(n+1)>P(n+2)$.\n\n\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s and Pomerance \\cite{ErPo78}, who proved the analogous result for $P(n)<P(n+1)<P(n+2)$. Solved by Balog \\cite{Ba01}, who proved that this is true for $\\gg \\sqrt{x}$ many $n\\leq x$ (for all large $x$). Balog suggests the natural conjecture that the density of such $n$ is $1/6$. A generalised form of this conjecture was presented by De Koninck and Doyon \\cite{DeDo11}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ba01] Balog, A., On triplets with descending largest prime factors. Studia Sci.
