What is the size of the largest $A\\subset \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $[a,b]\\leq N$ for all $a,b\\in A$, where $[a,b]$ is the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$?\n\nIs it attained by choosing all integers in $[1,(N/2)^{1/2}]$ together with all even integers in $[(N/2)^{1/2},(2N)^{1/2}]$?\n\n\n\nLet $g(N)$ denote the size of the largest such $A$. The construction mentioned proves that\\[g(N) \\geq \\left(\\tfrac{9}{8}n\\right)^{1/2}+O(1).\\]Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er51b} proved $g(N) \\leq (4n)^{1/2}+O(1)$, which was improved by Choi \\cite{Ch72b}. Chen \\cite{Ch98} established the asymptotic\\[g(N) \\sim \\left(\\tfrac{9}{8}n\\right)^{1/2}.\\]Chen and Dai \\cite{DaCh06} proved that\\[g(N)\\leq \\left(\\tfrac{9}{8}n\\right)^{1/2}+O\\left(\\left(\\frac{N}{\\log N}\\right)^{1/2}\\log\\log N\\right).\\]In \\cite{ChDa07} the same authors prove that, infinitely often, Erd\\H{o}s' construction is not optimal: if $B$ is that construction and $A$ is such that $\\lvert A\\rvert=g(N)$ then, for infinitely many $N$,\\[\\lvert A\\rvert\\geq \\lvert B\\rvert+t,\\]where $t\\geq 0$ is defined such that the $t$-fold iterated logarithm of $N$ is in $[0,1)$.\n\nThis is discussed in problems B26 and E2 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ch72b] Choi, S.
