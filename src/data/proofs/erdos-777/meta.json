Daykin and Frankl proved that if there are $(1+o(1))\\binom{m}{2}$ edges then $m^{1/n}\\to 1$ as $n\\to \\infty$.\n\nFor the first question we need to take $\\epsilon>0$ since since if $n$ is even and $m=2^{n/2+1}$ one could take $\\mathcal{F}$ to be all subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots,n/2\\}$ together with $\\{1,\\ldots,n/2\\}$ union all subsets of $\\{n/2+1,\\ldots,n\\}$, which produces $2^{n}$ edges.\n\nThe third question was answered in the affirmative by Alon and Frankl \\cite{AlFr85}, who proved that, for every $k\\geq 1$, if $m=2^{(\\frac{1}{k+1}+\\delta)n}$ for some $\\delta>0$ then the number of edges is\\[< \\left(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\right)\\binom{m}{2}+O(m^{2-\\Omega_k(\\delta^{k+1})}).\\]They also answer the second question in the negative, noting that if $\\mathcal{F}$ is the family of sets which either intersect $\\{n/2+1,\\ldots,n\\}$ in at most $1$ element or intersect $\\{1,\\ldots,n/2\\}$ in at least $n/2-1$ elements then $m \\gg n2^{n/2}$ and there are at least $2^{-5}\\binom{m}{2}$ edges.\n\nFinally, an affirmative answer to the first question follows from Theorem 1.4 and Corollary 1.5 of Alon, Das, Glebov, and Sudakov \\cite{ADGS15}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ADGS15] Alon, Noga and Das, Shagnik and Glebov, Roman and Sudakov,\nBenny, Comparable pairs in families of sets.
