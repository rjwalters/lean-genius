  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős (1973) studied sets A ⊆ {1,...,N} with a bounded number of representations m = p·a where p is prime. He proved the reciprocal sum is ≪ r·log N / log log N, but the optimal bound is unknown. This is related to Problems 536 and 537 on multiplicative representations.",
    "problemStatement": "Let r ≥ 2 and A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that for any m, at most r solutions exist to m = p·a with p prime and a ∈ A. Give the best possible upper bound for Σ_{n ∈ A} 1/n.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define reprCount and HasBoundedRepr to capture the representation constraint. ErdosProblem538 seeks the optimal bound function f(r,N). Erdős's bound r·log N / log log N is axiomatized, along with trivial bounds and connections to multiplicative structure.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "reprCount counts representations m = p·a with p prime, a ∈ A",
      "Erdős proved Σ 1/n ≪ r · log N / log log N by a counting argument",
      "For r = 1, the bound strengthens to log N / log log N",
      "The problem connects to multiplicative energy between A and the primes"
