  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős (1972) asked to estimate the maximum number of uniquely representable products from two subsets of {1,...,N}. Van Doorn established the best known bounds. Related to Problem #490.",
    "problemStatement": "For A, B ⊆ {1,...,N}, let F(A,B) count products m = ab with exactly one representation. Estimate max_{A,B} F(A,B).",
    "proofStrategy": "We define reprCount and uniqueProductCount computationally, axiomatize the maximum, and state Van Doorn's asymptotic bounds. We prove the trivial upper bound F ≤ |A|·|B| and the empty set case.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The trivial upper bound F(A,B) ≤ |A|·|B| follows from counting pairs",
      "Van Doorn's lower bound (1+o(1))N²/log N uses carefully chosen A, B",
      "The upper bound N²/(log N)^δ with δ ≈ 0.086 leaves a gap in the exponent",
      "The exact asymptotic order (whether N²/log N is tight) remains open"
