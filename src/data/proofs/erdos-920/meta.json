  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects two fundamental concepts in graph theory: chromatic numbers and clique-free graphs. The function g_k(n) measures the 'worst case' chromatic complexity among K_k-free graphs. The connection to Ramsey numbers R(k,m) makes this problem central to extremal combinatorics. Recent breakthrough by Mattheus-Verstraete (2023) resolved the k=4 case.",
    "problemStatement": "Let g_k(n) denote the largest chromatic number of a graph with n vertices containing no complete graph K_k. Is it true that for k ≥ 4, g_k(n) ≫ n^{1-1/(k-1)} / (log n)^c for some constant c > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem is connected to Ramsey theory: bounds on R(k,m) translate to bounds on g_k(n). The key insight is that if R(k,m) ≫ m^α / (log m)^β, then g_k(n) ≫ n^{1-1/α} / (log n)^{β/α}. Progress comes from improving Ramsey bounds.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "g_k(n) is the maximum chromatic number among K_k-free graphs on n vertices",
      "Upper bound: g_k(n) ≪ (n log log n / log n)^{1-1/(k-1)} [Graver-Yackel 1968]",
      "Connection to Ramsey numbers: better R(k,m) bounds give better g_k(n) bounds",
      "k=3 case well-understood: g_3(n) ≈ (n/log n)^{1/2}",
      "k=4 case resolved by Mattheus-Verstraete (2023): g_4(n) ≫ n^{2/3}/(log n)^{4/3}",
      "For k ≥ 5, there's still a gap between known and conjectured exponents"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #920 asks whether g_k(n) ≫ n^{1-1/(k-1)}/(log n)^c for K_k-free graphs. While the k=3 and k=4 cases are resolved (the latter by Mattheus-Verstraete in 2023), the general case for k ≥ 5 remains open with a gap between known (exponent 1-2/(k+1)) and conjectured (exponent 1-1/(k-1)) bounds.",
    "implications": "This problem connects chromatic number theory to Ramsey theory. Progress on either front advances understanding of both. The Mattheus-Verstraete breakthrough on R(4,t) was transformative for the k=4 case.",
