  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears in Erdős and Graham's 1980 monograph 'Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory' (p. 74). It asks about the intersection of binomial coefficient structure and prime number distribution — specifically whether binomial coefficients can equal products of consecutive primes infinitely often.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 2. Can C(n,k) be the product of consecutive primes p_i · p_{i+1} · ⋯ · p_j for infinitely many n? Known examples: C(21,2) = 210 = 2·3·5·7, C(7,3) = 35 = 5·7, C(10,4) = 210 = 2·3·5·7, C(14,4) = 1001 = 7·11·13, C(15,6) = 5005 = 5·7·11·13.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define prime enumeration and the notion of a product of consecutive primes, state known examples as axioms, formalize the main conjecture, and derive structural consequences (squarefreeness). The problem remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "A product of consecutive primes is necessarily squarefree, so squarefreeness of C(n,k) is a necessary condition",
      "For k = 2 the problem reduces to when n(n-1)/2 is a primorial quotient",
      "All known examples have relatively small k; whether large k can produce such products is unknown",
      "Related to Erdős problems 384 (prime divisors of C(n,k)) and 387 (divisors near n)"
