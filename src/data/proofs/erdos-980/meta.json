  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the distribution of k-th power nonresidues among primes. Erdős posed the question in 1961 and proved the quadratic case (k=2) himself, establishing that the sum of least quadratic nonresidues grows like c₂ · x/log x where c₂ = Σ p_j/2^j ≈ 3.67. The general case for all k ≥ 2 was resolved by P.D.T.A. Elliott in 1967.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 2 and n_k(p) denote the least k-th power nonresidue of prime p. Is it true that Σ_{p<x} n_k(p) ~ c_k · x/log x for some constant c_k > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines k-th power residues and nonresidues, the least nonresidue function n_k(p), and the sum S_k(x) = Σ_{p<x} n_k(p). Erdős's 1961 result for k=2 and Elliott's 1967 generalization are stated as axioms, with the main theorem showing existence of the positive constant c_k for all k ≥ 2.",

      "The least k-th power nonresidue n_k(p) is well-defined for primes p > k",
      "The constant c₂ = Σ_{j≥1} p_j/2^j where p_j is the j-th prime, converging to approximately 3.67",
      "The average value of n_k(p) over primes p < x is roughly c_k · log x",
      "Vinogradov's bound shows n(p) = O(p^{1/(4√e)+ε}) unconditionally",
      "Under GRH, the least quadratic nonresidue satisfies n(p) = O((log p)²)"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #980 is SOLVED. The conjecture is true: for all k ≥ 2, the sum Σ_{p<x} n_k(p) ~ c_k · x/log x with c_k > 0. Erdős proved the k=2 case in 1961 with the explicit constant c₂ = Σ p_j/2^j. Elliott completed the solution in 1967 by proving the general case for all k ≥ 2.",
    "implications": "The result shows that on average, the least k-th power nonresidue among primes p < x grows like c_k · log x. This connects to character sum estimates and the distribution of power residue symbols.",

      "What are the exact values of c_k for k > 2?",
      "Can the error term in the asymptotic be improved?",
      "How does the distribution of individual n_k(p) values compare to the average?"
