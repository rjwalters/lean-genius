    "historicalContext": "Euclid's theorem on the infinitude of primes, presented in Book IX, Proposition 20 of his *Elements* (circa 300 BCE), is one of the most celebrated results in mathematics. It answers a fundamental question: do the prime numbers eventually run out, or do they continue forever?\n\nThe theorem's proof is remarkable for its elegance and accessibility. Unlike many ancient mathematical results that have been superseded by modern methods, Euclid's proof remains the standard approach taught today. It requires no advanced mathematics—just the basic properties of divisibility and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.\n\nThis result has inspired centuries of research into the distribution of primes, from the Prime Number Theorem to the Riemann Hypothesis.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euclid):** There are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nMore precisely, for any natural number $n$, there exists a prime $p$ with $p > n$. In symbols:\n\n$$\\forall n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\exists p \\text{ prime}, p > n$$\n\nThis means the primes are **unbounded**—no matter how large a number we choose, there's always a larger prime.",
    "proofStrategy": "Euclid's proof is beautifully simple:\n\n1. **Given** any number $n$, consider $Q = n! + 1$\n2. **Observe** that $Q > 1$, so $Q$ has at least one prime divisor $p$\n3. **Claim** that $p > n$\n4. **Proof of claim:** If $p \\leq n$, then $p$ divides $n!$ (since $p$ appears in the product $1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot n$)\n5. **But** $p$ also divides $Q = n! + 1$\n6. **Therefore** $p$ divides $Q - n! = 1$\n7. **Contradiction:** No prime divides 1\n8. **Conclusion:** $p > n$ ✓",

    "summary": "This Lean formalization captures Euclid's timeless proof in precise logical terms. The key construction—considering n! + 1—reveals the beautiful interplay between multiplication and addition that makes primes inexhaustible.\n\nThe proof is entirely constructive in spirit: given any bound n, we can exhibit a number (n! + 1) that must have a prime divisor exceeding n. While we may not know which prime this is, we prove its existence with certainty.",
