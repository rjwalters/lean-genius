  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Nathanson in 1988 and concerns partitioning additive bases. An additive basis of order 2 is a set A such that A + A covers all sufficiently large integers. The representation function r_A(n) counts how many ways n can be written as a + b with a, b ∈ A.\n\nErdős and Nathanson (1989) showed that for any fixed threshold t, there exists a basis A with r_A(n) ≥ t for all large n that cannot be partitioned into two disjoint bases. They also proved that partition IS possible when r_A(n) > c log n for c > (log 4/3)^{-1} ≈ 3.48.\n\nThe problem asked about the intermediate case: if r_A(n) → ∞ (growing without bound, but possibly slower than log n), can A always be partitioned? Daniel Larsen (2026) showed the answer is NO, disproving the conjecture using an AI-assisted proof with Claude Opus 4.5.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A$ be an additive basis of order 2, meaning $A + A$ covers all sufficiently large integers. Let $r_A(n) = |\\{(a,b) \\in A \\times A : a + b = n\\}|$ be the representation function.\n\n**Question:** If $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} r_A(n) = \\infty$, can $A$ always be partitioned into two disjoint additive bases of order 2?\n\n**Answer:** NO (Larsen 2026)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization establishes the key definitions: additive basis, representation function, and partition into bases. The disproof uses a 'blocking property' construction: for any partition B ∪ C = A, infinitely many integers n fail to be covered by both B + B and C + C simultaneously.\n\nThe Larsen construction modifies the Erdős-Nathanson approach to ensure r_A(n) → ∞ while maintaining this blocking property. The formal proof shows that any set with the blocking property cannot be partitioned into two bases.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Representation Function**: r_A(n) counts how many ways n = a + b with a, b ∈ A; it measures 'redundancy' of coverage",
      "**Threshold vs Growth**: Having r_A(n) ≥ t (fixed) is too weak, while r_A(n) > c log n is strong enough for partition",
      "**Blocking Property**: A construction prevents partition by ensuring for any split, some integers are missed by at least one part",
      "**AI-Assisted Discovery**: The counterexample was found using Claude Opus 4.5, demonstrating AI utility in mathematical research",
      "**Gap Closure**: The result shows r_A(n) → ∞ behaves like the fixed-threshold case, not like the logarithmic case"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #871 has been DISPROVED. The conjecture that additive bases with r_A(n) → ∞ can always be partitioned into two disjoint bases is FALSE. Daniel Larsen (2026) constructed a counterexample using a modification of the Erdős-Nathanson blocking technique.",
    "implications": "The result clarifies the boundary between partitionable and non-partitionable bases. The growth condition r_A(n) → ∞ is insufficient for partition; one needs faster growth like r_A(n) > c log n. This advances understanding of the structure of additive bases.",
