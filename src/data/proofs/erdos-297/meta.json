How many $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ are there such that $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}=1$?\n\n\n\nIt was not even known for a long time whether this is $2^{cN}$ for some $c<1$ or $2^{(1+o(1))N}$. In fact the former is true, and the correct value of $c$ is now known.\n{UL}\n{LI}Steinerberger \\cite{St24} proved the relevant count is at most $2^{0.93N}$;{/LI}\n{LI}Independently, Liu and Sawhney \\cite{LiSa24} gave both upper and lower bounds, proving that the count is\\[2^{(0.91\\cdots+o(1))N},\\]where $0.91\\cdots$ is an explicit number defined as the solution to a certain integral equation;{/LI}\n{LI}Again independently this same asymptotic was proved (with a different proof) by Conlon, Fox, He, Mubayi, Pham, Suk, and Verstra\\\"{e}te \\cite{CFHMPSV24}, who prove more generally, for any $x\\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$, a similar expression for the number of $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}=x$;{/LI}\n{LI}The above papers all appeared within weeks of each other in 2024; in 2017 a similar question (with $\\leq 1$ rather than $=1$) was asked on MathOverflow by Mikhail Tikhomirov and proofs of the correct asymptotic were sketched by Lucia, RaphaelB4, and js21.{/LI}\n{/UL}\n\nSee also [362].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFHMPSV24] Conlon, D. and Fox, J. and He, X. and Mubayi, D. and Pham, H.
