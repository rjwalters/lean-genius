    "summary": "Erdős Problem #297 asks how many subsets of {1,...,N} have unit fraction sum exactly 1. The answer is 2^{(c+o(1))N} where c ≈ 0.91... This was solved in 2024 by three independent teams: Steinerberger (upper bound), Liu-Sawhney (full asymptotic), and Conlon et al. (same asymptotic plus generalization). The key insight is that c < 1, meaning the count is exponentially smaller than the naive bound 2^N.",
