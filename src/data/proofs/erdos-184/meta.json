The graph $K_{3,n-3}$ shows that at least $(1+c)n$ many cycles and edges are required, for some constant $c>0$. In \\cite{Er71} Erd\\H{o}s suggests that only $n-1$ many cycles and edges are required if we do not require them to be edge-disjoint.\n\nThe best bound available is due to Buci\\'{c} and Montgomery \\cite{BM22}, who prove that $O(n\\log^*n)$ many cycles and edges suffice, where $\\log^*$ is the iterated logarithm function.\n\nConlon, Fox, and Sudakov \\cite{CFS14} proved that $O_\\epsilon(n)$ cycles and edges suffice if $G$ has minimum degree at least $\\epsilon n$, for any $\\epsilon>0$.\n\nSee also [583] for an analogous problem decomposing into paths, and [1017] for decomposing into complete graphs.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BM22] Buci\\'C, M. and Montgomery, R., Towards the Erd\\H{o}s-Gallai Cycle Decomposition Conjecture. arXiv:2211.07689 (2022).\n\n[CFS14] Conlon, David and Fox, Jacob and Sudakov, Benny, Cycle packing.
