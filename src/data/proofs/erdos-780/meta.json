Prove that some colour class must contain $k$ pairwise disjoint edges.\n\n\n\nIn other words, this problem asks to determine the chromatic number of the Kneser graph. This would be best possible: if $n=kr-1+(t-1)(k-1)$ then decomposing $[n]$ as one set $X_1$ of size $kr-1$ and $t-1$ sets $X_2,\\ldots,X_{t}$ of size $k-1$, a colouring without $k$ pairwise disjoint edges is given colouring all subsets of $X_0$ in colour $1$ and assigning an edge with colour $2\\leq i\\leq t$ if $i$ is minimal such that $X_i$ intersects the edge.\n\nWhen $k=2$ this was conjectured by Kneser and proved by Lov\\'{a}sz \\cite{Lo78}. The general case was proved by Alon, Frankl, and Lov\\'{a}sz \\cite{AFL86}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AFL86] Alon, N. and Frankl, P. and Lov\\'{a}sz, L., The chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs.
