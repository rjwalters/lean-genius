Can one even disprove that $f(n)\\gg \\log n$?\n\nSander \\cite{Sa92} proved that $f(n)\\to \\infty$, and later \\cite{Sa95} quantified this to $f(n) \\gg (\\log n)^{1/10-o(1)}$. Sander \\cite{Sa95} also proved that $f(n)\\ll \\log n$ for all $n$, and that $f(n) \\gg \\log n$ for almost all $n$. The proofs of the latter two facts are very easy using Kummer's theorem -- indeed, this immediately implies that any $p$ divides $\\binom{2n}{n}$ with multiplicity $\\ll \\log_p n$, and that the multiplicity with which $2$ divides $\\binom{2n}{n}$ is equal to the number of $1$s in the binary expansion of $n$, which is $\\gg \\log n$ for almost all $n$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Kolesnik \\cite{ErKo99} improved the lower bound for all $n$ to\\[f(n) \\gg (\\log n)^{1/4-o(1)}.\\]It remains open whether $f(n) \\gg \\log n$ for all $n$.\n\nSander \\cite{Sa92b} proved that, for all $0<\\epsilon<1$, if $n$ is sufficiently large and $\\lvert d\\rvert\\leq n^{1-\\epsilon}$ then $\\binom{2n+d}{n}$ is not squarefree.\n\nThe largest $n$ known for which $\\binom{2n}{n}$ is not divisible by the square of an odd prime is $n=786$ (found by Levine). Guy \\cite{Gu04} reports that Erd\\H{o}s 'feels sure that there are no larger such $n$'.\n\nSee also [379].\n\nThis is mentioned in problem B33 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErKo99] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Kolesnik, Grigori, Prime power divisors of binomial coefficients.
