  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Sárközy (1985) proved the result for sufficiently large n. Granville-Ramaré (1996) completed the proof for all n ≥ 5. The related function f(n) measuring maximum prime power exponent has been studied by Sander (1992, 1995) and Erdős-Kolesnik (1999), who improved the lower bound to (log n)^{1/4}.",
    "problemStatement": "Show that for any n ≥ 5, the central binomial coefficient C(2n, n) is not squarefree.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof has two main cases: (1) When n is not a power of 2, then 4 | C(2n,n), so it's not squarefree. (2) When n = 2^k, one must show an odd prime square divides C(2n,n). Kummer's theorem relates v_p(C(m+n,m)) to carries in base-p addition, giving v_2(C(2n,n)) = popcount(n).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "4 | C(2n, n) unless n is a power of 2 (by Kummer's theorem)",
      "v_2(C(2n, n)) equals the number of 1s in the binary expansion of n",
      "For n = 2^k, the squareness comes from odd primes",
      "f(n) satisfies (log n)^{1/4} ≪ f(n) ≪ log n with the lower bound open for all n"
