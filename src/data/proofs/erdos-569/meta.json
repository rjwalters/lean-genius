  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #569 was posed by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp in 1993 (referenced as [EFRS93]). It asks a fundamental question about Ramsey numbers: how does the Ramsey number R(C_{2k+1}, H) scale with the number of edges m of a graph H that has no isolated vertices?\n\nThe problem connects two central themes in combinatorics. Ramsey theory studies the emergence of order in large structures, while extremal graph theory asks how graph properties relate to edge density. Problem #569 bridges these by asking whether the Ramsey number for odd cycles vs arbitrary graphs grows at most linearly in the edge count.\n\nPartial results are known: for k = 1 (triangles), the bound R(C_3, H) ≤ 2m + 1 is established. The general bound R(C_{2k+1}, H) ≤ c · k · m is known, but the question of whether the dependence on k can be removed (replaced by a constant depending only on k) remains open. The restriction to odd cycles is essential, as even cycles exhibit fundamentally different Ramsey behavior.",
    "problemStatement": "For $k \\geq 1$, determine the best possible constant $c_k$ such that\n$$R(C_{2k+1}, H) \\leq c_k \\cdot m$$\nfor any graph $H$ on $m$ edges without isolated vertices.\n\nHere $R(C_{2k+1}, H)$ is the two-color Ramsey number: the smallest $N$ such that every 2-coloring of $K_N$ contains a red $C_{2k+1}$ or a blue copy of $H$.\n\n**Status:** OPEN\n\nThis problem cannot be resolved by a finite computation.",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines:\n\n1. **Odd cycle length**: OddCycleLength k = 2k + 1 with proved properties\n2. **No isolated vertices**: Every vertex has at least one neighbor\n3. **R_cycle_graph**: The Ramsey number R(C_{2k+1}, H) for H with m edges\n4. **LinearRamseyBound**: The target property R ≤ c · m\n5. **Known results**: Triangle case (k=1), pentagon case (k=2)\n6. **General bounds**: EFRS93 upper bound, star graph lower bound\n7. **Connections**: Chvátal's theorem, Burr-Erdős conjecture, odd vs even parity\n\nMost results are axiomatized since they require deep Ramsey-theoretic arguments beyond Mathlib.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Odd vs Even Parity**: Odd cycles C_{2k+1} have much nicer Ramsey behavior than even cycles C_{2k}. The restriction to odd length is essential for the linear bound to hold.",
      "**Edge Count vs Vertex Count**: Problem #569 measures complexity by edge count m, while classical Ramsey theory uses vertex count n. Since H has no isolated vertices, n ≤ 2m, so linear in edges implies linear in vertices.",
      "**Triangle Case (k=1)**: R(C_3, H) ≤ 2m + 1 is known, giving c_1 ≤ 3. This is the simplest case and the bound is essentially tight.",
      "**Burr-Erdős Connection**: The Burr-Erdős conjecture (proved by Lee 2017) shows d-degenerate graphs have linear Ramsey numbers in vertex count. Problem #569 asks a related question for edge count.",
      "**Lower Bound from Stars**: The star K_{1,m} has m edges, and R(C_{2k+1}, K_{1,m}) ≥ 2m + 1, showing c_k ≥ 2.",
      "**Non-Finite**: Unlike many combinatorial problems, this cannot be settled by checking finitely many cases."
