Equality is achieved when $A=\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe study of $\\phi_A$ was introduced by Cassels \\cite{Ca50b}, who proved that there exist sequences such that\\[\\liminf_{N\\to \\infty}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k\\leq N}\\frac{\\phi_A(k)}{n_k}=0.\\]Cassels proved that the property of divergence of $\\sum_k \\frac{f(n_k)}{k}$ implying, for almost all $\\alpha$, \\[\\left\\lvert \\alpha-\\frac{m_k}{n_k}\\right\\rvert < \\frac{f(n_k)}{n_k^2},\\]is equivalent to the above $\\liminf$ being $>0$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64b} believed that a sequence with the property in the question does not exist. He could only prove that the limit of $\\frac{\\phi_A(k)}{n_k}$ as $k\\to \\infty$ cannot be $0$.\n\nIn fact he proved that if $\\liminf \\frac{\\phi_A(k)}{n_k}=0$ then $\\limsup \\frac{\\phi_A(k)}{n_k}=1$. Indeed, the hypothesis implies that for any $\\epsilon>0$ there are arbitrarily large $k$ such that $\\phi(n_k)<\\epsilon n_k$, and hence there are arbitrarily large primes $p$ such that $p$ divides some $n_i\\in A$. If $n_k$ is minimal such that $p\\mid n_k$ then every $1\\leq m\\leq n_k$ not divisible by $p$ has the required property, and hence $\\phi_A(k)/n_k\\geq 1-\\frac{1}{p}$.\n\nThis was solved by Haight \\cite{Ha} who proved that such a sequence does exist (contrary to Erd\\H{o}s' expectations).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ca50b] Cassels, J.
