  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem (Er79d) about least prime factors of integers near n. The problem connects to prime gap conjectures: Cramér's conjecture would imply a stronger result. Granville refined the expected constant to 2e^{-γ}. Related to Problems #681 and #682.",
    "problemStatement": "For all sufficiently large n, does there exist k ≥ 1 such that the least prime factor of n+k exceeds k² + 1? The variant asks whether replacing k² + 1 by e^{(1+ε)√k} + C_ε makes this false.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize both the main conjecture and exponential variant using Nat.minFac. Connections to Cramér's conjecture and Granville's refinement are stated. We prove that prime offsets give large least prime factors and establish the k=1 case.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "When n+k is prime, minFac(n+k) = n+k, which easily exceeds k² + 1 for large n",
      "The exponential bound e^{(1+ε)√k} grows faster than k², so the variant is strictly stronger",
      "Cramér's conjecture on prime gaps would imply the existence of such offsets k",
      "For k=1, the condition minFac(n+1) > 2 simply means n+1 is odd"
