    "historicalContext": "This proof is attributed to Hippasus of Metapontum (~500 BCE). Legend says he was thrown overboard for revealing that sqrt(2) is irrational, challenging the Pythagorean belief that all numbers are rational.\n\nThe proof demonstrates the method of infinite descent: assuming sqrt(2) = a/b in lowest terms leads to both a and b being even, contradicting the assumption.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem**: There are no natural numbers a, b with b > 0 such that a^2 = 2 * b^2 and gcd(a,b) = 1.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying sqrt(2) is irrational, since if sqrt(2) = a/b in lowest terms, then a^2 = 2b^2.",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Classic Proof by Contradiction**:\n\n1. Assume sqrt(2) = a/b where a, b are coprime\n2. Then 2b^2 = a^2, so a^2 is even\n3. Therefore a is even (key lemma!), say a = 2k\n4. Substituting: 2b^2 = 4k^2, so b^2 = 2k^2\n5. Therefore b^2 is even, so b is even\n6. But both a and b even contradicts gcd(a,b) = 1!",
