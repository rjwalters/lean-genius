They also prove that if $k=2$ then there are at least\\[\\frac{N}{2}-O(\\log N)\\]many even numbers which are of this form, and that $O(\\log N)$ is best possible, since there is a $2$-colouring such that no power of $2$ is representable as a monochromatic sum.\n\nA refinement of this problem appears as Problem 25 on the open problems list of Ben Green.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ESS89] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and S\\'{a}rk\\\"ozy, A. and S\\'{o}s, V.
