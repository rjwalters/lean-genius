  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This was originally a conjecture of Klaus Roth about the structure of sumsets under finite partitions. Erdős promoted the problem, and it was solved by Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós in 1989. Their solution established precise bounds that were stronger than the original conjecture. A refinement appears as Problem 25 on Ben Green's open problems list.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove that there exists an absolute constant c > 0 such that, whenever {1,...,N} is k-colored (with N large enough depending on k), there are at least cN integers representable as monochromatic sums - that is, a + b where a, b are in the same color class and a ≠ b.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines k-colorings and monochromatic sums, then states Roth's conjecture. We present the Erdős-Sárközy-Sós theorem giving the precise bound N/2 - O(N^{1-1/2^{k+1}}) for even sums, and the improved O(log N) bound for 2-colorings. The optimality construction using 2-adic valuations is also stated.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #484 was SOLVED by Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós in 1989. They proved that in any k-coloring of {1,...,N}, at least N/2 - O(N^{1-1/2^{k+1}}) even integers are representable as monochromatic sums. For 2-colorings, the bound improves to N/2 - O(log N), which is optimal as shown by the 2-adic valuation construction.",
    "implications": "The result establishes that monochromatic sums are unavoidable in colorings - almost half of all even numbers must be representable. This connects partition theory to additive combinatorics and sumset structure.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact optimal constant in front of the error term?",
      "How do the results extend to higher-order monochromatic sums?",
      "What is the structure of optimal colorings that minimize monochromatic sums?"
