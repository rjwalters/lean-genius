  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This $100 Erdős problem asked whether bounded ranges of moduli can achieve arbitrarily good almost-coverings. Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance, and Yu disproved it, showing no constant C works. Related to the famous problem of perfect covering systems (minimum modulus bounded by Bloom-Briggs-Maynard-Smith-Tao).",
    "problemStatement": "An ε-almost covering system is a set of congruences with distinct moduli such that the density of uncovered integers is at most ε. Does there exist C > 1 such that for all ε > 0 and N ≥ 1, an ε-almost covering exists with moduli in [N, CN]?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize congruence systems, uncovered density, and the main question. The FFKPY disproof shows that for C ≤ N^{α(N)} where α(N) = log log log N / (4 log log N), the uncovered density is bounded below. We also formalize what DOES work: growing C with N.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Answer is NO: no constant C works (FFKPY disproof)",
      "For C ≤ N^{α(N)}, uncovered density ≥ (1-o(1)) · ∏(1 - 1/n_i)",
      "The product ∏(1 - 1/n_i) ≥ 1/C for moduli in [N, CN]",
      "Growing C (e.g., C = N^{1/log log N}) DOES work for any fixed ε",
      "Connected to perfect coverings via BBMST bound < 616,000"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #27, a $100 problem that was DISPROVED. The question was whether a constant C > 1 allows ε-almost coverings with moduli in [N, CN] for all ε and N. The answer is NO: Filaseta-Ford-Konyagin-Pomerance-Yu showed that for any fixed C, uncovered density cannot be made arbitrarily small.",
    "implications": "This result reveals a fundamental limitation of covering systems with bounded moduli ranges. It connects to the study of perfect covering systems, where the BBMST bound shows minimum modulus must be < 616,000.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the optimal function f(N) such that ε-almost coverings exist with moduli in [N, f(N)·N]?",
      "Can the critical exponent α(N) = log log log N / (4 log log N) be improved?",
      "What is the true minimum modulus bound for perfect coverings?"
