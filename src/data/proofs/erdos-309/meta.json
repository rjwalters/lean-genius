How many integers can be written as the sum of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$? Are there $o(\\log N)$ such integers?\n\n\n\nIf the number of such integers is $N(n)$ then it is trivial that $N(n)\\leq \\log n+O(1)$. Yokota \\cite{Yo97} proved that $N(n)\\geq \\log n-O(\\log\\log n)$.\n\nCroot \\cite{Cr99} proved that every integer at most\\[\\leq \\sum_{n\\leq N}\\frac{1}{n}-(\\tfrac{9}{2}+o(1))\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\]can be so represented.\n\nIf $F(N)$ counts the number of integers which can be represented in this fashion, then the current best lower bound known is\\[F(N) \\geq \\log N+\\gamma -\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}+o(1)\\right)\\frac{(\\log\\log N)^2}{\\log N}\\]due to Yokota \\cite{Yo02}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cr99] Croot, III, Ernest S., On some questions of Erd\\H{o}s and Graham about Egyptian fractions.
