  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Rousseau, appearing in Erdős's 1993 paper [Er93, p.344]. It asks whether a local density condition on all large subgraphs forces a triangle. The constant 1/50 is motivated by the C₅ blow-up (or Petersen graph blow-up), which is triangle-free and achieves subgraph edge density near n²/50.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph with n vertices such that every induced subgraph on ≥ ⌊n/2⌋ vertices has more than n²/50 edges. Must G contain a triangle?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define graphs, induced subgraphs, the dense subgraphs condition, and state the conjecture. We record the C₅ blow-up extremal example, partial results by EFRS (constant 16), Krivelevich (subgraph size 3n/5), Razborov (flag algebras), and Norin–Yepremyan (high overall edge count).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The C₅ blow-up is triangle-free and achieves subgraph density ≈ n²/50, so the constant is tight",
      "EFRS proved the result with 50 replaced by 16, leaving a factor ~3 gap",
      "Razborov's flag algebra method improves the constant to 27/1024 ≈ 0.0264 vs 1/50 = 0.02",
      "Krivelevich trades subgraph size (3n/5 instead of n/2) for a better constant (25)",
      "Norin–Yepremyan handle graphs with many total edges, leaving sparse graphs as the hard case"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #128 remains open despite significant partial progress. The gap between the best constant achieved (27/1024 by Razborov) and the conjectured 1/50 is narrow, suggesting the problem may be within reach of current flag algebra or regularity methods.",
    "implications": "Resolution would advance extremal graph theory, connecting local density conditions to global substructure. The C₅ blow-up extremality would establish a precise Turán-type threshold for local-to-global triangle forcing.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Can flag algebras close the gap from 27/1024 to 1/50?",
      "Is the C₅ blow-up the unique extremal example?",
      "What happens for K₄ instead of triangles?",
      "Can the subgraph size threshold n/2 be reduced below 3n/5?"
