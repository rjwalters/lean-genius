  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The isoperimetric problem is one of the oldest in mathematics, known to the ancient Greeks. The legendary Queen Dido founded Carthage by using an ox hide cut into a thin strip to enclose maximum land. Rigorous proofs came in the 19th century.",
    "problemStatement": "**Isoperimetric Theorem**: For any simple closed curve with perimeter L enclosing area A:\n\n$$4\\pi A \\leq L^2$$\n\nEquality holds if and only if the curve is a circle.",
    "proofStrategy": "Modern proofs use calculus of variations, Fourier analysis, or the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. The key is showing that any deviation from circular shape decreases the area-to-perimeter ratio.",
