  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this in their 1980 monograph on problems in combinatorial number theory. The problem asks for the largest subset of {1,...,N} that supports an irreducible signed unit-fraction vanishing sum.",
    "problemStatement": "Find the maximum c(N) = max |A| for A ⊆ {1,...,N} admitting δ : A → {±1} with Σ δ(n)/n = 0 and Σ_{A'} δ(n)/n ≠ 0 for every non-empty proper subset A'.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the irreducible zero-sum property, define c(N), and state the known Adenwalla/Croot lower bound. The exact asymptotics remain open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "An irreducible zero sum means the vanishing is 'tight' — removing any element breaks it",
      "Adenwalla achieves (1−1/e+o(1))N using Croot's unit-fraction construction",
      "The construction uses B ⊆ [(1/e)N, N] with Σ 1/b = 1, then A = B ∪ {1}",
      "Trivial upper bound is N; the gap between (1−1/e)N and N is open",
