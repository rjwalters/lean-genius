  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this in 1980, further discussed in Erdős (1992). The question explores composites that are far from n but still closer to n than to their own least prime factor. Even composites (p(m) = 2) can't satisfy the condition for large f(n), so the conjecture requires odd composites with large least prime factors.",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist f : ℕ → ℕ with f(n) → ∞ such that for all large n, some composite m satisfies n + f(n) < m < n + p(m)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the least prime factor gap, the function F(n), the main conjecture, and provide density and structural observations about composites with large least prime factors.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Even composites have p(m) = 2, so m < n + 2 — useless for large f(n)",
      "The conjecture requires composites with large least prime factor near n",
      "F(n) = min_{m>n} (m − p(m)) relates to how far composites exceed their smallest factor",
      "Erdős asks if n − F(n) ~ c√n for some constant c",
