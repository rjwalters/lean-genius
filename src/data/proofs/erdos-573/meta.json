  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Simonovits and concerns the Turán-type extremal function for graphs forbidding both triangles (C₃) and 4-cycles (C₄). The celebrated Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem from 1954 established that ex(n; C₄) ~ (1/2)n^(3/2). Erdős and Simonovits proved that ex(n; {C₄, C₅}) = (n/2)^(3/2) + O(n). This problem asks whether forbidding triangles instead of 5-cycles gives the same (n/2)^(3/2) asymptotic.\n\nThe question is subtle: while ex(n; {C₃, C₄}) ≤ ex(n; C₄) trivially, the conjectured asymptotic (n/2)^(3/2) is smaller than (1/2)n^(3/2) by a factor of √2. This would mean the triangle-free constraint actually reduces the leading constant.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nIs it true that ex(n; {C₃, C₄}) ~ (n/2)^(3/2)?\n\nHere ex(n; F) denotes the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph containing no subgraph isomorphic to any graph in F.\n\n**Known bounds:**\n- Upper: ex(n; {C₃, C₄}) ≤ ex(n; C₄) ≤ (1/2)n^(3/2) + O(n)\n- Lower: ex(n; {C₃, C₄}) ≥ c·n^(3/2) for some c > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the key predicates (triangle-free, C₄-free) and the extremal function. We axiomatize the Kővári-Sós-Turán bound and establish the upper bound via composition. The conjecture is formalized as an asymptotic statement using ε-δ form. The problem remains OPEN - the formalization captures what is known without claiming resolution.",
