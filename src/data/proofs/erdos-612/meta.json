    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Pach, Pollack, and Tuza (1989) proved that any connected graph on n vertices with minimum degree d has diameter D ≤ 3n/(d+1) + O(1). They conjectured that forbidding cliques would improve this bound.\n\n**Original Conjectures:**\n1. K_{2r}-free with (r-1)(3r+2)|d: D ≤ (2(r-1)(3r+2))/(2r²-1) · n/d\n2. K_{2r+1}-free with (3r-1)|d: D ≤ (3r-1)/r · n/d\n\n**Counterexamples (2021):** Czabarka, Singgih, and Székely disproved both for r ≥ 2.\n\n**Amended Conjecture:** For K_{k+1}-free: D ≤ (3-2/k) · n/d + O(1)",
    "problemStatement": "**Setup:** G is connected, n vertices, minimum degree d, diameter D, K_r-free.\n\n**Original Question:** Does D ≤ α(r) · n/d + O(1) for specific α(r) coefficients?\n\n**Status:**\n- **r = 1 (triangle-free):** TRUE — D ≤ 5n/(2d) + O(1)\n- **r ≥ 2:** DISPROVED — counterexamples exist with larger diameter\n\n**Amended Conjecture:** D ≤ (3 - 2/k) · n/d for K_{k+1}-free (partially verified)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines `diameter`, `minDegree`, and `IsKFree`\n2. States `OriginalConjecture1` and `OriginalConjecture2`\n3. Defines coefficient functions `alpha_2r` and `alpha_2r1`\n4. States `counterexample_exists` for r ≥ 2\n5. Proves `original_conjecture1_false` for r ≥ 2\n6. States `triangle_free_diameter` for base case\n7. Defines `AmendedConjecture` with coefficient (3 - 2/k)\n8. Shows special cases and the Moore bound connection",
