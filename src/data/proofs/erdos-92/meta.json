    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in which every $x\\in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.\n\nIs it true that $f(n)\\leq n^{o(1)}$? Or even $f(n) < n^{O(1/\\log\\log n)}$?\n\n\n\nThis is a stronger form of the unit distance conjecture (see [90]).\n\nThe set of lattice points imply $f(n) > n^{c/\\log\\log n}$ for some constant $c>0$. Erd\\H{o}s offered \\$500 for a proof that $f(n) \\leq n^{o(1)}$ but only \\$100 for a counterexample. This latter prize is downgraded to \\$50 in \\cite{ErFi97}.\n\nIt is trivial that $f(n) \\ll n^{1/2}$. A result of Pach and Sharir (Theorem 4 of \\cite{PaSh92}) implies $f(n) \\ll n^{2/5}$. Hunter has observed that the circle-point incidence bound of Janzer, Janzer, Methuku, and Tardos \\cite{JJMT24} implies\\[f(n) \\ll n^{4/11}.\\]Fishburn (personal communication to Erd\\H{o}s, later published in \\cite{ErFi97}) proved that $6$ is the smallest $n$ such that $f(n)=3$ and $8$ is the smallest $n$ such that $f(n)=4$, and suggested that the lattice points may not be best example.\n\nSee also [754].\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErFi97] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Fishburn, Peter, Minimum planar sets with maximum equidistance counts.
