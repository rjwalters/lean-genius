  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Sauer conjectured this decomposition property for r-uniform hypergraphs, published in Erdős' 1981 paper. The problem connects Turán-type extremal theory with decomposition problems in hypergraph theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Is every r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices the union of at most ex_r(n; K_{r+1}^r) copies of K_r^r and K_{r+1}^r, no two sharing a K_r^r?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define r-uniform hypergraphs, complete cliques, and the Turán number. We state the Erdős–Sauer decomposition conjecture and note the graph case (r=2) and the open Turán density problem.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The decomposition must be edge-disjoint: no two pieces share an r-edge",
      "For r=2, the bound is ⌊n²/4⌋ from Turán's theorem",
      "For r ≥ 3, even the Turán number ex_r(n; K_{r+1}^r) is unknown",
      "The conjecture links extremal hypergraph theory with decomposition theory",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The Erdős–Sauer conjecture asks whether every r-uniform hypergraph can be decomposed into at most ex_r(n; K_{r+1}^r) edge-disjoint complete sub-hypergraphs. This intertwines two major open areas: hypergraph Turán theory and decomposition theory.",
    "implications": "Resolution would provide a fundamental structural result connecting the Turán number with decomposability of hypergraphs, extending classical graph decomposition results to the hypergraph setting.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does the Erdős–Sauer decomposition hold for all r?",
      "Can the graph case (r=2) be resolved independently?",
      "What is the relationship to fractional decompositions?",
