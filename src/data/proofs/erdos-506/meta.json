  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the combinatorial geometry of circles determined by point sets, analogous to the classical question about lines (Sylvester–Gallai). Elliott (1967) resolved the large-n case, showing at least C(n-1,2) circles for n > 393 non-degenerate points. Segre demonstrated the bound fails for small n using a cube projection.",
    "problemStatement": "What is the minimum number of distinct circles determined by n points in ℝ², not all on a single circle (and not all collinear)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define circumcircles of point triples, circle counting for configurations, and state Elliott's theorem for n > 393. We record Segre's counterexample showing the bound fails at n = 8 and pose the open question for small n.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Three non-collinear points determine a unique circle via the circumcircle construction",
      "Elliott (1967) proved ≥ C(n-1,2) circles for n > 393, matching the number of pairs",
      "Segre's cube projection shows 8 points can determine fewer than C(7,2) = 21 circles",
      "The problem is analogous to Sylvester–Gallai for lines, but much harder for circles",
      "Connected to Erdős Problems #104 (distinct distances) and #831"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #506 is largely resolved for large n by Elliott's theorem (1967), but the minimum number of circles remains open for small n ≤ 393, where Segre's counterexample shows the asymptotic bound fails.",
    "implications": "Complete resolution would advance combinatorial geometry, connecting to incidence geometry, algebraic curves, and the broader program of Erdős-type extremal problems for geometric configurations.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the exact minimum number of circles for each n ≤ 393?",
      "Can Elliott's threshold 393 be reduced?",
      "Is the minimum achieved by algebraically structured configurations (e.g., lattices)?",
