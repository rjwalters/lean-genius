Must there exist a straight line $\\ell$ such that the projection of\\[\\{ z: \\lvert f(z)\\rvert\\leq 1\\}\\]onto $\\ell$ has measure at most $2$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian \\cite{EHP58}.\n\nPommerenke \\cite{Po61} (using his previous work \\cite{Po59}) proved that the answer is no, and there exists such an $f$ for which the projection of this set onto every line has measure at least $2.386$. On the other hand, Pommerenke also proved there always exists a line such that the projection has measure at most $3.3$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHP58] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Herzog, F. and Piranian, G., Metric properties of polynomials.
