  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #1043 was posed by Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian in their 1958 paper on metric properties of polynomials. They studied how 'spread out' the level set {z : |f(z)| ≤ 1} can be.\n\nFor f(z) = zⁿ, this level set is the closed unit disk, which projects to an interval of length 2 in every direction. The natural question: is 2 always achievable as the minimum projection length?\n\nPommerenke (1961) proved the answer is NO. He constructed polynomials where every projection has measure at least 2.386. However, he also proved that 3.3 is always achievable—every monic polynomial has some direction with projection measure ≤ 3.3.\n\nThese 'level sets' are called lemniscates, named after the figure-eight shape of {z : |z² - 1| = c}.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f ∈ ℂ[x] be a monic non-constant polynomial. Consider the level set:\n\n$$ L_f = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |f(z)| \\leq 1\\} $$\n\nMust there exist a line ℓ such that the projection of $L_f$ onto ℓ has measure ≤ 2?\n\n**Answer**: NO (Pommerenke 1961)\n\n**Bounds**:\n- Some polynomials have all projections ≥ 2.386\n- Every polynomial has some projection ≤ 3.3",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by:\n\n1. **Level sets**: Define {z : |f(z)| ≤ r} for polynomials\n2. **Projections**: Map ℂ to ℝ via z ↦ Re(z · conj(u)) for unit vector u\n3. **Projection measure**: Length of the projected set\n4. **EHP conjecture**: The (false) claim that measure ≤ 2 is always achievable\n5. **Pommerenke's results**: Counterexample (≥ 2.386) and upper bound (≤ 3.3)\n\nThe key insight is that while f(z) = zⁿ gives a round disk, other polynomials can create elongated level sets that are 'wide' in every direction.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Level sets (lemniscates)**: The set {z : |f(z)| ≤ 1} generalizes the unit disk. For zⁿ it's a disk; for more complex polynomials, it can be multi-lobed.",
      "**Projection measure**: The length of the 'shadow' when projecting onto a line. For a disk of radius 1, this is always 2.",
      "**The answer is NO**: Pommerenke found polynomials where you can't achieve projection ≤ 2 in any direction.",
      "**Upper bound 3.3**: While 2 isn't always achievable, 3.3 is. The gap between 2.386 and 3.3 represents what we don't know.",
      "**Bernoulli lemniscate**: The classic {z : |z² - 1| = c} gives a figure-eight, illustrating how level sets can be non-convex."
