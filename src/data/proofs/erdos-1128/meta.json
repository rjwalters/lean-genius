  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A problem of Erdős and Hajnal in partition calculus, asking whether the cardinal Ramsey property ℵ₁³ → (ℵ₀)³₂ holds. Prikry and Mills disproved it in 1978 with a counterexample, though their proof remained unpublished. The result was later documented by Todorčević (1994) and Komjáth (2025).",
    "problemStatement": "Let A, B, C be three sets of cardinality ℵ₁. Is it true that in any 2-coloring of A × B × C, there must exist A₁ ⊂ A, B₁ ⊂ B, C₁ ⊂ C, all of cardinality ℵ₀, such that A₁ × B₁ × C₁ is monochromatic?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the cardinal setup, the coloring problem, and the monochromatic cube condition. The Prikry-Mills counterexample is stated as an axiom, showing that a 'bad' coloring exists that avoids all countably infinite monochromatic cubes.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The uncountability of ℵ₁ allows construction of 'bad' colorings",
      "The counterexample uses ordinal structure to encode information",
      "In partition notation: ℵ₁³ ↛ (ℵ₀)³₂",
      "Finite Ramsey theory analogues hold, but infinite versions fail",
      "The 2-dimensional case ℵ₁² ↛ (ℵ₀)²₂ also fails"
