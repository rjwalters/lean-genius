Is it true that, in any $2$-colouring of $A\\times B\\times C$, there must exist $A_1\\subset A$, $B_1\\subset B$, $C_1\\subset C$, all of cardinality $\\aleph_0$, such that $A_1\\times B_1\\times C_1$ is monochromatic?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal.\n\nThis was disproved by Prikry and Mills in 1978 but this seems to have been unpublished.
