  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is the higher-dimensional generalization of the famous distinct distances problem. Kelly posed this problem about the threshold function g_d(n)—the minimum number of points in ℝ^d that guarantee n distinct pairwise distances. Erdős (1975) showed 'easily' that g_d(n) ≫ d^{n-1}. The hypercube provides a key construction: its 2^d vertices achieve only d distinct distances. Croft (1962) computed g_3(3) = 7, showing even small cases require careful analysis.",
    "problemStatement": "Let g_d(n) be minimal such that every collection of g_d(n) points in ℝ^d determines at least n distinct distances. Estimate g_d(n). In particular, does lim_{d→∞} g_d(n)/d^{n-1} exist?",
    "proofStrategy": "The Lean formalization defines g_d(n) as the infimum of thresholds guaranteeing n distinct distances. The cube construction provides the key lower bound: 2^d vertices have distances √1, √2, ..., √d (at most d values). Known bounds are captured as axioms: Erdős's lower bound g_d(n) ≫ d^{n-1} and Erdős-Straus upper bound g_d(n) ≤ c^{d^{1-b_n}}. The gap between bounds leaves the limit question open.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The threshold function g_d(n) captures how many points in ℝ^d guarantee n distinct distances. The cube construction shows g_d(d+1) > 2^d, while Erdős proved g_d(n) ≫ d^{n-1}. The Erdős-Straus upper bound g_d(n) ≤ c^{d^{1-b_n}} leaves a huge gap. Whether g_d(n)/d^{n-1} converges as d → ∞ remains the central open question.",
