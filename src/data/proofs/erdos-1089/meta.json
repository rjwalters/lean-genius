Estimate $g_d(n)$. In particular, does\\[\\lim_{d\\to \\infty}\\frac{g_d(n)}{d^{n-1}}\\]exist?\n\n\n\nA question of Kelly. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75f} writes it is 'easy' to see that $g_d(n)\\gg d^{n-1}$. Erd\\H{o}s and Straus proved (in unpublished work mentioned in \\cite{Er75f}) that\\[g_d(n) \\leq c^{d^{1-b_n}}\\]for some constants $c>0$ and $b_n>0$.\n\nIt is trivial that $g_1(3)=4$, and easy to see that $g_2(3)=6$. Croft \\cite{Cr62} proved $g_3(3)=7$. The vertices of a $d$-dimensional cube demonstrate that\\[g_d(d+1)>2^d.\\]The function $g_d(n)$ is essentially the inverse of the function $f_d(n)$ considered in [1083] - with our definitions, $g_d(n)>m$ if and only if $f_d(m)<n$. The emphasis in this problem is, however, on the behaviour for fixed $n$ as $d\\to\\infty$.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cr62] Croft, H. T., $9$-point and $7$-point configurations in $3$-space. Proc.
