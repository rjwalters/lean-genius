    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #180, posed by Erdős and Simonovits [ErSi82], asks whether the Turán number of a finite graph family is always dominated by a single member. For non-bipartite families, the Erdős-Stone theorem resolves this. A folklore counterexample (star + matching) exists for infinite families.",
    "problemStatement": "For a finite family F of graphs, let ex(n;F) be the maximum edges in an n-vertex F-free graph. Does there always exist G in F such that ex(n;G) = O(ex(n;F))? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines ExFamily, ExSingle, HasDomination, and the main conjecture ErdosConjecture180. The non-bipartite case is axiomatized via Erdős-Stone. The bipartite case and folklore counterexample for infinite families are formalized.",
