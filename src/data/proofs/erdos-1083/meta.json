    "historicalContext": "**Distinct Distances in Higher Dimensions**\n\nThis is the natural generalization of the famous distinct distances problem (Erdős #89, solved by Guth-Katz 2015) to higher dimensions. Erdős posed this in 1946, proving that f_d(n) is between n^{1/d} and n^{2/d}.\n\n**Key Contributors:**\n- **Erdős (1946):** Original bounds n^{1/d} ≪ f_d(n) ≪ n^{2/d}\n- **CEGSW (1990):** f_3(n) ≫ n^{1/2}\n- **APST (2004):** f_d(n) ≫ n^{1/(d-90/77)-o(1)}\n- **Solymosi-Vu (2008):** f_d(n) ≫ n^{2/d - c/d²} for d ≥ 4\n- **Guth-Katz (2015):** Solved the 2D case",
    "problemStatement": "Let d ≥ 3, and let f_d(n) be the minimal m such that every set of n points in ℝ^d determines at least m distinct distances. Estimate f_d(n) - in particular, is it true that f_d(n) = n^{2/d - o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach:**\n\n1. **Definitions:** Points in ℝ^d as (Fin d → ℝ), Euclidean distance via sqrt of sum of squares, distance set and numDistinctDistances.\n\n2. **The f_d Function:** Defined as the minimum over all n-point configurations.\n\n3. **Axiomatized Results:** All bounds are axiomatized since they require complex incidence geometry arguments.\n\n4. **Conjecture:** The main conjecture f_d(n) = n^{2/d - o(1)} is formalized as DistinctDistanceConjecture.\n\n5. **Connections:** Links to 2D (Guth-Katz) and inverse function g_d (Problem #1089).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Lattice Extremals:** Integer lattice points achieve the upper bound n^{2/d}",
      "**Gap Shrinks with d:** The gap n^{c/d²} between lower and upper bounds shrinks as d grows",
      "**3D is Special:** f_3(n) ≥ n^{0.6} from Solymosi-Vu combined with Guth-Katz",
      "**Duality:** f_d and g_d (from #1089) are essentially inverse functions",
      "**2D Solved:** Guth-Katz (2015) showed f_2(n) ≈ n/log n, which helps the 3D case",
      "**Open Conjecture:** Whether f_d(n) = n^{2/d - o(1)} remains unresolved"
