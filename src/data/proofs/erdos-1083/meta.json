Estimate $f_d(n)$ - in particular, is it true that\\[f_d(n)=n^{\\frac{2}{d}-o(1)}?\\]\n\n\n\nA generalisation of the distinct distance problem [89] to higher dimensions. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er46b} proved\\[n^{1/d}\\ll_d f_d(n)\\ll_d n^{2/d},\\]the upper bound construction being given by a set of lattice points.\n{UL}\n{LI} Clarkson, Edelsbrunner, Gubias, Sharir, and Welzl \\cite{CEGSW90} proved $f_3(n)\\gg n^{1/2}$.{/LI}\n{LI}Aronov, Pach, Sharir, and Tardos \\cite{APST04} proved $f_d(n)\\gg n^{\\frac{1}{d-90/77}-o(1)}$ for any $d\\geq 3$ (for example, $f_3(n)\\gg n^{0.546}$).{/LI}\n{LI}Solymosi and Vu \\cite{SoVu08} proved $f_3(n) \\gg n^{3/5}$ and\\[ f_d(n)\\gg_d n^{\\frac{2}{d}-\\frac{c}{d^2}}\\]for all $d\\geq 4$ for some constant $c>0$. (The result in their paper for $d=3$ is slightly weaker than stated here, but uses as a black box the bound for distinct distances in $2$ dimensions; we have recorded the consequence of combining their method with the work of Guth and Katz on [89].){/LI}\n{/UL}\n\nThe function $f_d(n)$ is essentially the inverse of the function $g_d(n)$ considered in [1089] - with our definitions, $g_d(n)>m$ if and only if $f_d(m)<n$. The emphasis in this problem is, however, on the behaviour as $d$ is fixed and $n\\to \\infty$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[APST04] Aronov, Boris and Pach, J\\'anos and Sharir, Micha and Tardos,\nG\\'abor, Distinct distances in three and higher dimensions.
