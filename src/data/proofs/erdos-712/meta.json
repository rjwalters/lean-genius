  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is one of the most famous open problems in extremal combinatorics, dating back to Turán's work in 1941. While Turán completely solved the graph case (r=2), determining that ex_2(n,K_k)/C(n,2) → (1-1/(k-1))/2, the hypergraph case for r > 2 has resisted all attempts for over 80 years. Even the simplest case, ex_3(n, K_4^3), remains open. Erdős offered $500 for any single case with k > r > 2, and $1000 for 'clearing up the whole set of problems'.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine, for any k > r > 2, the value of lim_{n→∞} ex_r(n, K_k^r)/C(n,r), where ex_r(n, K_k^r) is the maximum number of r-edges on n vertices containing no complete k-clique K_k^r.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines r-uniform hypergraphs, the Turán number ex_r(n, K_k^r), and the Turán density π_r(K_k^r). For r=2, Turán's theorem gives the exact answer. For r>2, we state the problem as open and include known bounds (de Caen lower bound, Razborov/flag algebra upper bounds). The famous case K_4^3 is highlighted: Turán conjectured π_3(K_4^3) = 5/9, with current bounds 5/9 ≤ π_3(K_4^3) ≤ 0.5616.",
