A probabilistic argument shows that there exists some $\\epsilon=\\epsilon(H)>0$ such that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \\gg n^{2-\\frac{2}{r}+\\epsilon}.\\]This conjecture was disproved by Janzer \\cite{Ja23} for even $r\\geq 4$. The case $r=3$ was disproved by Janzer \\cite{Ja23b}, who constructed, for any $\\epsilon>0$, a $3$-regular bipartite graph $H$ such that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H)\\ll n^{\\frac{4}{3}+\\epsilon}.\\]In \\cite{Ja23} Janzer conjectures that the above lower bound is sharp, in that for any $r\\geq 3$ and $\\epsilon>0$ there exists an $r$-regular graph $H$ such that\\[\\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \\ll n^{2-\\frac{2}{r}+\\epsilon}.\\]Janzer's result proves this for even $r\\geq 4$.\n\nSee also [113], [146], and [714].\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErSi84] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Simonovits, M., Cube-supersaturated graphs and related problems.
