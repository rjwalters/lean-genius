Frankl and Lin \\cite{Li76} independently showed that the answer is yes, and the largest solution is\\[2^7=2!+3!+5!.\\]In fact Lin showed that the largest power of $2$ which can divide a sum of distinct factorials containing $2$ is $2^{254}$, and that there are only 5 solutions to $3^m=a_1!+\\cdots+a_k!$ (when $m=0,1,2,3,6$).\n\nSee also [404].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Li76] Lin, S., On two problems of Erd\\H{o}s concerning sums of distinct factorials.
