  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Sophie Germain (1776-1831) was a pioneering French mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory and elasticity theory. Working in an era when women were excluded from formal mathematical education, she corresponded with Gauss and Lagrange under a male pseudonym.\n\nHer work on Fermat's Last Theorem introduced what we now call Sophie Germain primes. She proved that if p is a Sophie Germain prime, then the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem holds for exponent p. This was a major breakthrough, as it provided infinitely many exponents for which FLT was partially verified.\n\nThe conjecture that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes remains open, analogous to the twin prime conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition**: A prime p is a **Sophie Germain prime** if 2p + 1 is also prime.\n\nThe prime q = 2p + 1 is called a **safe prime**.\n\n**Examples**: 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 83, 89, ...\n\n**Structure Theorem**: For p > 3, if p is a Sophie Germain prime, then p ≡ 5 (mod 6).\n\nEquivalently, Sophie Germain primes greater than 3 have the form 6k - 1.",
    "proofStrategy": "The structure theorem follows from modular arithmetic:\n\n1. **All primes > 3 are ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6)**: Since primes > 3 are not divisible by 2 or 3, they avoid residue classes 0, 2, 3, 4 (mod 6).\n\n2. **If p ≡ 1 (mod 6)**: Then 2p + 1 ≡ 2·1 + 1 ≡ 3 (mod 6), so 3 | (2p + 1). But 2p + 1 > 3 for p > 1, so 2p + 1 cannot be prime.\n\n3. **Therefore p ≡ 5 (mod 6)**: The only remaining possibility.\n\nThis gives the form p = 6k - 1 for some k ≥ 1.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization provides a complete treatment of Sophie Germain primes, from definition through the main structure theorem. The key result—that Sophie Germain primes greater than 3 must satisfy p ≡ 5 (mod 6)—follows from a clean modular arithmetic argument.\n\nThe proof demonstrates how divisibility constraints propagate: if p ≡ 1 (mod 6), then 2p + 1 is divisible by 3, eliminating these candidates. Only p ≡ 5 (mod 6) remains viable.",
    "implications": "**Applications in Cryptography**\n\nSophie Germain and safe primes are crucial in cryptography:\n\n1. **Diffie-Hellman**: Safe primes ensure the multiplicative group has large prime-order subgroups\n\n2. **RSA**: Some implementations prefer safe primes to resist certain attacks\n\n3. **Pohlig-Hellman**: Safe primes make discrete log harder by avoiding small subgroups\n\n**Connection to Fermat's Last Theorem**\n\nSophie Germain proved: If p is a Sophie Germain prime, then x^p + y^p = z^p has no solutions with p ∤ xyz (the \"first case\" of FLT).",
