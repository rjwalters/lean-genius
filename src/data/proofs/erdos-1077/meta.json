  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem 1077 was posed by Erdős and Simonovits (1970) in the context of extremal graph theory. A graph is D-balanced if the ratio of maximum to minimum degree is at most D. The question asks: given a dense graph (one with n^{1+α} edges), how large a balanced subgraph can we guarantee?\n\nThe original statement had ambiguities: the exponent 1-α suggested in [ErSi70] decreases as α increases, which is counterintuitive. The erdosproblems.com entry clarifies that this was likely a typo.\n\nJiang and Longbrake (2025) provided a complete resolution: the optimal number of vertices is Θ(n^α). They proved every such graph has a 6-balanced subgraph on Ω(n^α) vertices, and complete bipartite graphs show this is tight.",
    "problemStatement": "A graph is **D-balanced** if max_degree ≤ D · min_degree.\n\nLet $\\alpha > 0$. If $G$ has $n$ vertices and at least $n^{1+\\alpha}$ edges, how large a D-balanced subgraph can we guarantee?\n\n**Answer:** The optimal size is $\\Theta(n^\\alpha)$ vertices (Jiang-Longbrake 2025).",
    "proofStrategy": "The resolution has two parts:\n\n**Upper Bound:** Complete bipartite graphs K_{n^α, n^{1-α}} have n^{1+α-α} = n edges from the small side. Any balanced subgraph can only use O(n^α) vertices from the small side.\n\n**Lower Bound:** Jiang-Longbrake show that iterative regularization produces a 6-balanced subgraph on Ω(n^α) vertices. The key is that removing high-degree vertices while preserving edges eventually produces regularity.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**D-balanced graphs:** Graphs where degree variation is bounded by factor D. 1-balanced = regular.",
      "**Dense graphs:** Having n^{1+α} edges means average degree ≈ n^α, which is superlinear.",
      "**Complete bipartite:** K_{a,b} is the extremal example showing we can't do better than n^α.",
      "**The constant 6:** Jiang-Longbrake's 6-balanced result is explicit and likely not optimal."

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem 1077 about balanced subgraphs in dense graphs. The original conjecture (as literally stated) was false due to a likely typo. Jiang and Longbrake (2025) resolved the corrected question, showing the optimal number of vertices in a guaranteed D-balanced subgraph is Θ(n^α).",
    "implications": "The resolution has implications for extremal graph theory:\n\n1. **Regularity methods:** Finding balanced subgraphs is key to many regularity-based arguments.\n\n2. **Bipartite extremality:** Complete bipartite graphs are extremal for this problem.\n\n3. **Explicit constants:** The constant 6 in the lower bound may be improvable.",
