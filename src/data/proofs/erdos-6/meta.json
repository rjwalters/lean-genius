  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Turán in 1948. Erdős was confident it was true, famously offering substantial money only for a *disproof*. The problem remained open for over 60 years until the revolutionary work on bounded gaps between primes.\n\nThe breakthrough came from Zhang's 2013 proof of bounded gaps (infinitely many prime pairs differ by at most 70 million), followed by Maynard and Tao's improvements. Banks, Freiberg, and Turnage-Butterbaugh applied this machinery to solve Erdős Problem 6 in 2015.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question**: Let $d_n = p_{n+1} - p_n$ be the gap between consecutive primes. Are there infinitely many $n$ such that $d_n < d_{n+1} < d_{n+2}$?\n\n**Answer**: YES. In fact, for any $m \\geq 1$:\n- Infinitely many $n$ with $d_n < d_{n+1} < \\cdots < d_{n+m}$\n- Infinitely many $n$ with $d_n > d_{n+1} > \\cdots > d_{n+m}$",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the prime gap function $d_n$ using Mathlib's `Nat.Prime.nth`. Predicates `HasIncreasingGaps` and `HasDecreasingGaps` capture monotone sequences of gaps. The main theorem by Banks-Freiberg-Turnage-Butterbaugh is axiomatized since its proof requires:\n\n1. **Maynard-Tao sieve methods**: Finding many primes in short intervals\n2. **Zhang's bounded gaps**: The foundational breakthrough\n3. **Careful distribution analysis**: Controlling gap patterns\n\nThe resolution `erdos_6_solved` follows directly as the case $m=2$.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #6 is SOLVED in the affirmative. Banks, Freiberg, and Turnage-Butterbaugh (2015) proved that there are infinitely many n with d_n < d_{n+1} < d_{n+2}, and more generally, arbitrarily long monotone sequences of prime gaps exist in both directions.",
    "implications": "**Historical Significance:**\n\nThis problem demonstrates how breakthroughs in one area (bounded gaps) can unlock progress in related questions. The Maynard-Tao machinery, developed for the twin prime conjecture, proved versatile enough to settle this 67-year-old problem.\n\n**Mathematical Impact:**\n\n1. Prime gaps are highly irregular - they oscillate forever\n2. No eventual monotonicity in either direction\n3. The distribution of primes is rich enough to produce arbitrarily complex local patterns",
