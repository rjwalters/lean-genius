  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Cauchy (1821) showed continuous additive functions are linear. Hamel (1905) used AC to construct wild discontinuous additive functions. Erdős (1960) asked about almost additive functions - those satisfying the equation except on a null set. De Bruijn (1966) and Jurkat (1965) independently proved that almost-additivity can always be 'repaired'.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nIf f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y) for almost all x,y ∈ ℝ (i.e., except on a null set in ℝ²), then there exists a function g such that:\n1. g(x+y) = g(x) + g(y) for ALL x,y ∈ ℝ\n2. f(x) = g(x) for almost all x\n\nThe correction g is unique among additive functions.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines additive and almost-additive functions via measure theory. The de Bruijn-Jurkat theorem is axiomatized. Uniqueness follows from the fact that an additive function zero a.e. is identically zero. Wild additive functions and measurability results are included for context.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Almost a.e. ⟹ Truly:** Almost-additivity can be repaired",
      "**Uniqueness:** The corrected g is unique among additive functions",
      "**Wild Functions:** Without regularity, additive functions can be pathological",
      "**Measurability ⟹ Linear:** Lebesgue measurable additive ⟹ linear",
      "**Stability:** This is a stability theorem for functional equations",
      "**Historical:** Cauchy → Hamel → Erdős → de Bruijn/Jurkat"
