  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem sits at the heart of hypergraph Ramsey theory, a generalization of classical Ramsey theory to k-uniform hypergraphs (where edges connect exactly k vertices rather than 2). For graphs (k = 2), Erdős and Szekeres (1935) showed that Ramsey numbers grow exponentially: roughly 2^{n/2} < R(n) < 4^n.\n\nFor 3-uniform hypergraphs (edges are triples), growth is dramatically faster. Erdős, Hajnal, and Rado proved in 1965 that 2^{cn²} < R₃(n) < 2^{2^n}. The lower bound is singly exponential in n², while the upper bound is a tower of exponentials of height 2.\n\nThe central question (Problem #564) asks whether the lower bound can be improved to match the tower height of the upper bound. If true, it would show that hypergraph Ramsey numbers are fundamentally 'tower-type' — requiring iterated exponentiation to describe. Erdős offered $500 for a resolution.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem (Erdős-Hajnal-Rado, 1965)**: Let $R_3(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of the 3-uniform hypergraph on $m$ vertices are 2-coloured, there is a monochromatic complete 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices.\n\nIs there some constant $c > 0$ such that\n$$R_3(n) \\geq 2^{2^{cn}}?$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN ($500 prize)\n\n**Known Bounds** (Erdős-Hajnal-Rado 1965):\n$$2^{cn^2} < R_3(n) < 2^{2^n}$$\n\nThe question asks whether the 'tower height' of the lower bound (currently 1, exponential in n²) can be increased to 2, matching the upper bound.\n\n**Evidence**: Erdős, Hajnal, Máté, and Rado (1984) proved a doubly exponential lower bound for the 4-colour version, suggesting the 2-colour case might also have such a bound.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this OPEN problem by:\n\n1. **Uniform Hypergraphs**: Define k-uniform hypergraphs as sets of k-element subsets of vertices.\n\n2. **Ramsey Property**: Define HasHypergraphRamseyProperty k m n expressing that any 2-colouring of the complete k-uniform hypergraph on m vertices contains a monochromatic clique of size n.\n\n3. **Ramsey Function**: Axiomatize R k n as the minimal m with the Ramsey property.\n\n4. **Known Bounds**: State the Erdős-Hajnal-Rado upper and lower bounds as axioms.\n\n5. **Main Conjecture**: Express erdos_564_conjecture using Filter.atTop to state 'for all sufficiently large n'.\n\n6. **Tower Functions**: Define tower k n = 2↑↑k (iterated exponentiation) to clarify the growth rate hierarchy.\n\n7. **Known Values**: State R₃(3) = 4 and R₃(4) = 13 as axioms.\n\n8. **Comparison**: State bounds for graph Ramsey numbers (k = 2) showing they're merely exponential.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Tower growth hierarchy**: The key insight is about 'tower height'. Growth rate 2^n (tower 1) is fundamentally different from 2^{2^n} (tower 2). The question asks which tower height describes R₃(n).",
      "**Graph vs hypergraph gap**: For graphs (k = 2), Ramsey numbers grow exponentially (tower 1). For k = 3, we know they're between tower(1, n²) and tower(2, n). The gap is enormous.",
      "**Known small values**: R₃(3) = 4 and R₃(4) = 13 are known exactly. These small values give no hint about asymptotic behavior.",
      "**4-colour evidence**: The doubly exponential lower bound for 4 colours suggests the 2-colour case might also have tower height 2.",
      "**Bounds gap**: For n = 10, the lower bound ~2^{100} and upper bound 2^{1024} differ by a factor of 2^{924} — illustrating the massive uncertainty."

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #564, an OPEN question with a $500 prize asking whether R₃(n) ≥ 2^{2^{cn}} for some c > 0. We axiomatize the hypergraph Ramsey function, state the known Erdős-Hajnal-Rado bounds, and define tower functions to clarify the growth rate hierarchy. The problem asks whether hypergraph Ramsey numbers have 'tower height' 2 (doubly exponential) or remain closer to tower height 1 (singly exponential).",
    "implications": "A resolution would fundamentally characterize the growth rate of hypergraph Ramsey numbers. A positive answer (YES) would show they're doubly exponential, with profound implications for combinatorics and theoretical computer science. A negative answer would suggest an interesting 'intermediate' growth rate between singly and doubly exponential.",
