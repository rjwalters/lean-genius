A problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Rado \\cite{EHR65}, who prove the bounds\\[2^{cn^2}< R_3(n)< 2^{2^{n}}\\]for some constant $c>0$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, M\\'{a}t\\'{e}, and Rado \\cite{EHMR84} have proved a doubly exponential lower bound for the corresponding problem with $4$ colours.\n\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHMR84] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Hajnal, Andr\\'{a}s and M\\'{a}t\\'{e}, Attila and Rado, Richard, Combinatorial set theory: partition relations for cardinals.
