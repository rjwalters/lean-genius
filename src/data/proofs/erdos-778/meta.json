    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #778: Clique-Building Games**\n\nThis problem concerns competitive edge-coloring games on complete graphs, a topic in combinatorial game theory related to Ramsey theory.\n\n**Three Game Variants:**\n1. **Clique Game:** Alice wins if max red clique > max blue clique\n2. **Modified Game:** Bob colors 2 edges per turn; wins if his max > Alice's\n3. **Degree Game:** Alice wins if max red degree > max blue degree\n\n**Recent Progress:**\nMalekshahian and Spiro (arXiv:2410.18304, 2024) proved significant partial results, showing Bob wins in most cases but the complete answer remains open.\n\n**Erdos's Belief:**\nErdos believed Bob should always have a winning strategy for the clique game when n >= 3.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nAlice and Bob play on $K_n$, alternating coloring edges red (Alice) and blue (Bob). Alice goes first.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Does Bob have a winning strategy for $n \\geq 3$? (Main question)\n2. Modified: Bob colors 2 edges per turn. Does Bob win for $n > 3$?\n3. Degree variant: Who wins when comparing maximum degrees?\n\n**Known (Malekshahian-Spiro 2024):**\n- Clique game: Bob wins with density $\\geq 3/4$\n- If Alice wins at $n$, Bob wins at $n+1, n+2, n+3$\n- Degree game: Bob wins with density $\\geq 2/3$",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Setup:** Define K_n using Mathlib's SimpleGraph\n\n2. **Game State:** EdgeColor inductive type with Red, Blue, Uncolored\n\n3. **Winning Conditions:** Define when Alice/Bob wins each game variant\n\n4. **Strategies:** Define strategy types as functions from state to edge choice\n\n5. **Main Results:** Axiomatize Malekshahian-Spiro theorems\n\n6. **Implications:** Derive consequences like alice_no_three_consecutive",
