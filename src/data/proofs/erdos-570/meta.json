  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This Ramsey-type problem asks for upper bounds on R(C_k, H), where C_k is a k-cycle and H is any graph without isolated vertices. The conjecture was resolved incrementally: EFRS (1993) proved even k, Sidorenko and Goddard-Kleitman (1993-94) proved k=3, Jayawardene (1999) proved k=5, and Cambie-Freschi-Morawski-Petrova-Pokrovskiy (2024) completed the proof for all odd k≥7.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 3. For any graph H on m edges without isolated vertices, R(C_k, H) ≤ 2m + ⌈(k-1)/2⌉.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cycle graphs, edge counts, and Ramsey numbers abstractly. Each case (even k, k=3, k=5, odd k≥7) is axiomatized based on the published results. The main theorem combines all cases by case-splitting on k's parity and value.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "R(C_k, H) measures when a 2-coloring of K_n must contain either a k-cycle or H",
      "The bound 2m + ⌈(k-1)/2⌉ is linear in the number of edges",
      "Even and odd k require different proof techniques",
      "The problem was fully resolved over 30 years (1993-2024)",
      "The bound is tight for certain extremal graphs"
