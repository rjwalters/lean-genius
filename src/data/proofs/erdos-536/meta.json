  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this at the 1991 West Coast Number Theory session, building on earlier work from the 1960s–70s. The problem asks whether positive-density subsets of {1,...,N} must contain three elements with equal pairwise LCMs.",
    "problemStatement": "For any ε > 0 and N sufficiently large, if A ⊆ {1,...,N} with |A| ≥ εN, must there exist distinct a, b, c ∈ A with [a,b] = [b,c] = [a,c]?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the equal-pairwise-LCM property, state the density conjecture, and record Weisenberg's partial results (both positive and constructive).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Equal pairwise LCMs means a, b, c are divisors of a common L covering all prime factors",
      "Weisenberg proved the conjecture for ε > 221/225 ≈ 0.982",
      "The analogous statement for four elements is false (Erdős)",
      "Constructions avoiding the property can have size ≫ N/log N",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #536 asks whether dense subsets of {1,...,N} must contain three elements with equal pairwise LCMs. Weisenberg proved it for density > 221/225 and showed no four-element analogue holds. The general case remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would illuminate the multiplicative structure of dense integer sets and the distribution of LCM patterns.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does the conjecture hold for all ε > 0?",
      "What is the threshold density (if any)?",
      "Can Weisenberg's 221/225 bound be improved?",
