  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Platonic solids were known to the ancient Greeks and studied extensively by Plato (hence the name). Euclid proved in Elements Book XIII that these are the only five regular convex polyhedra.\n\nThe classification relies on Euler's polyhedral formula V - E + F = 2 combined with the regularity constraints that all faces are congruent regular polygons and the same number of faces meet at each vertex.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euclid, c. 300 BCE)**: There are exactly **five** Platonic solids (convex regular polyhedra):\n\n1. **Tetrahedron**: 4 triangular faces, {3, 3}\n2. **Cube**: 6 square faces, {4, 3}\n3. **Octahedron**: 8 triangular faces, {3, 4}\n4. **Dodecahedron**: 12 pentagonal faces, {5, 3}\n5. **Icosahedron**: 20 triangular faces, {3, 5}\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #50.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof via Schlafli Symbols**:\n\nA Platonic solid is characterized by {p, q} where p = sides per face and q = faces per vertex.\n\n1. Using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2 and regularity conditions:\n   - pF = 2E (each edge shared by 2 faces)\n   - qV = 2E (each edge connects 2 vertices)\n\n2. Derive the constraint: **1/p + 1/q > 1/2**, equivalently **(p-2)(q-2) < 4**\n\n3. Enumerate all integer solutions with p, q >= 3:\n   - (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (5,3)\n\n4. Verify each corresponds to a valid polyhedron",
