  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and Ivić, and recorded in the 1986 Oberwolfach problem book. It concerns a fundamental question about the additive structure of powerful numbers.\n\nA number n is r-powerful (or r-full) if every prime p dividing n satisfies p^r | n. For r = 2, these are called 'squarefull' numbers (4, 8, 9, 16, 25, ...). For r = 3, they are 'cubefull' numbers.\n\nErdős (1976) claimed the r = 2 case was 'easy', though the first rigorous proof came from Baker and Brüdern in 1994. Notably, Erdős initially claimed a simple counting argument showed infinitely many integers are not representable, but Schinzel discovered an error in this reasoning.\n\nHeath-Brown (1988) proved a complementary result: all sufficiently large integers ARE sums of at most three squarefull numbers. This creates an interesting contrast—the set of representable integers has density 0 (sparse) yet eventually contains all integers (with enough summands).",
    "problemStatement": "Let $r \\geq 3$. A number $n$ is **$r$-powerful** if for every prime $p \\mid n$, we have $p^r \\mid n$.\n\n**Question 1**: Are there infinitely many integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of at most $r$ many $r$-powerful numbers?\n\n**Question 2**: Does the set of integers expressible as such sums have natural density 0?\n\n**Status**: OPEN for $r \\geq 3$\n\n**Partial Results**:\n- $r = 2$: Baker-Brüdern (1994) proved density is 0\n- Heath-Brown (1988): All large integers are sums of $\\leq 3$ squarefull numbers",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the concept of r-powerful numbers and the set of their sums. The main conjecture (density 0 for r ≥ 3) is stated as a definition since it remains open.\n\nThe solved cases are axiomatized:\n- Baker-Brüdern's theorem: SumsOfPowerful 2 2 has density 0\n- Heath-Brown's theorem: Eventually all integers are in SumsOfPowerful 2 3\n\nWe also formalize several open variants, including the three cubes problem and the universal representation conjecture.",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #940 on sums of r-powerful numbers. The main conjecture (density 0 for r ≥ 3) remains OPEN. We formalize the definition of r-powerful numbers, the set of sums, and axiomatize the known results: Baker-Brüdern's density-0 theorem for squarefull pairs and Heath-Brown's representation theorem for squarefull triples.",
    "implications": "This problem connects additive combinatorics with multiplicative number theory. The contrast between density results (sparse sets) and representation results (eventual coverage) illustrates the subtle relationship between these concepts. Understanding powerful numbers has applications to ABC conjecture and related problems.",
