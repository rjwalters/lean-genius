A number $n$ is $r$-powerful if for every prime $p$ which divides $n$ we have $p^r\\mid n$.\n\nAre there infinitely many integers which are not the sum of at most $r$ many $r$-powerful numbers? Does the set of integers which are the sum of at most $r$ $r$-powerful numbers have density $0$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er76d} claims that the claim that the set has density $0$ is 'easy' for $r=2$ (a potential 'easy argument' is given in the comments by Tao; this was first proved in the literature by Baker and Br\\\"{u}dern \\cite{BaBr94}). For $r=3$ it is not even known if those integers which are the sum of at most three cubes has density $0$.\n\nIn the Oberwolfach problem book this is recorded in 1986 as a problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Ivi\\'{c}.\n\nIn \\cite{Er76d} Erd\\H{o}s claims that 'a simple counting argument' implies that there are infinitely many integers which are not the sum of at most $r$ many $r$-powerful numbers, but Schinzel pointed out he made a mistake.\n\nHeath-Brown \\cite{He88} has proved that all large numbers are the sum of at most three $2$-powerful numbers, see [941].\n\nSee also [1081] for a more refined question concerning the case $r=2$, and [1107] for the case of $r+1$ summands.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaBr94] Baker, R.
