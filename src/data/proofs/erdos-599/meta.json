Must there exist a family $P$ of disjoint paths between $A$ and $B$ and a set $S$ which contains exactly one vertex from each path in $P$, and such that every path between $A$ and $B$ contains at least one vertex from $S$?\n\n\n\nSometimes known as the Erd\\H{o}s-Menger conjecture. When $G$ is finite this is equivalent to Menger's theorem. Erd\\H{o}s was interested in the case when $G$ is infinite.\n\nThis was proved by Aharoni and Berger \\cite{AhBe09}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AhBe09] Aharoni, Ron and Berger, Eli, Menger's theorem for infinite graphs.
