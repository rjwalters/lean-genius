Estimate $f_d(n)$. In particular, is it true that, for fixed $n\\geq 3$,\\[f_d(n)=2^{o(d)}?\\]\n\n\n\nIt is easy to prove that $f_d(n) \\leq n^{O_d(1)}$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75f} claimed that he and Straus proved $f_d(n)\\leq c_n^d$ for some constant $c_n>0$.\n\nWhen $d=1$ this is the subject of [530], and $f_1(n)\\asymp n^2$.\n\nWhen $n=3$ this is the subject of [503]. Erd\\H{o}s could prove $f_2(3)=7$ and Croft \\cite{Cr62} proved $f_3(3)=9$. The results described at [503] demonstrate that $f_d(3)=d^2/2+O(d)$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Cr62] Croft, H.
