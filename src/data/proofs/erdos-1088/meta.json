    "historicalContext": "**The Distinct Distance Subset Problem**\n\nErdos posed this problem in 1975, asking how many points in R^d guarantee a subset of n points with all pairwise distances distinct. The problem connects combinatorics, discrete geometry, and high-dimensional analysis.\n\n**Known Exact Values:**\n- Erdos proved f_2(3) = 7 (plane case for 3 points)\n- Croft (1962) proved f_3(3) = 9 (3D case for 3 points)\n- General: f_d(3) = d^2/2 + O(d)\n\n**Related Problems:**\n- Problem #530: One-dimensional case where f_1(n) ~ n^2\n- Problem #503: The n = 3 case in arbitrary dimension",
