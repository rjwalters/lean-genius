If the edges of $K_{r^2+1}$ are $r$-coloured then there exist $r+1$ vertices with at least one colour missing on the edges of the induced $K_{r+1}$.\n\n\n\nIn other words, there is no balanced colouring. A conjecture of Erd\\H{o}s and Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s \\cite{ErGy99}, who proved it for $r=3$ and $r=4$ (and observered it is false for $r=2$), and showed this property fails for infinitely many $r$ if we replace $r^2+1$ by $r^2$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErGy99] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Andr\\'{a}s, Split and balanced colorings of complete graphs.
