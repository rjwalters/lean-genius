  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Gyárfás conjectured this in their 1999 paper 'Split and balanced colorings of complete graphs'. A balanced r-colouring means every induced K_{r+1} uses all r colours. They proved it for r=3 and r=4, showed r=2 fails, and demonstrated that K_{r²} can have balanced colourings for infinitely many r.",
    "problemStatement": "Let r ≥ 3. If the edges of K_{r²+1} are r-coloured, then there exist r+1 vertices with at least one colour missing on the edges of the induced K_{r+1}. Equivalently, no balanced r-colouring of K_{r²+1} exists for r ≥ 3.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines edge colourings, induced cliques, and the balanced/non-balanced properties. Known results are axiomatized for r=3 (K_10) and r=4 (K_17). Counterexamples for r=2 and the K_{r²} boundary are recorded.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #617 is PARTIALLY SOLVED. The Erdős-Gyárfás conjecture states that for r ≥ 3, no balanced r-colouring of K_{r²+1} exists. This is proved for r=3,4 and open for r ≥ 5. The boundary is sharp: r=2 fails and K_{r²} can be balanced.",
    "implications": "This reveals a threshold phenomenon in edge colourings of complete graphs. The extra vertex beyond r² fundamentally changes what colourings are possible.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is the conjecture true for r ≥ 5?",
      "What is the structure of balanced colourings of K_{r²}?",
      "Are there algebraic constructions for all cases?"
