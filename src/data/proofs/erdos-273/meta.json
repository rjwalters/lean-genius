  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A covering system is a finite collection of residue classes whose union is all integers. Erdős asked whether one can construct a covering system using only moduli of the form p-1 for primes p ≥ 5. When p ≥ 3 is allowed, Selfridge found such a system using divisors of 360. The restriction to p ≥ 5 excludes modulus 2 (= 3-1), making coverage much harder. From Erdős–Graham (1980), p.24.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there a covering system all of whose moduli are of the form p - 1 for some primes p ≥ 5?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define CoveringSystem as a structure with moduli, residues, and a covering property. IsPrimeMinusOne and AllModuliPrimeMinusOne capture the modulus constraint. The main question ErdosProblem273 asks for existence. We axiomatize Selfridge's example for p ≥ 3, the reciprocal sum condition, and structural constraints on p ≥ 5 covering systems.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Selfridge's covering system works when p ≥ 3 is allowed (modulus 2 = 3-1 available)",
      "For p ≥ 5, the smallest allowed modulus is 4 (= 5-1), excluding modulus 2",
      "Without modulus 2, covering all even integers requires careful arrangement of larger even moduli",
      "The sum of reciprocals of allowed moduli must be ≥ 1 for a covering to exist"
