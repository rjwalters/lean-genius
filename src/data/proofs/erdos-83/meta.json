Then\\[\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\binom{4n}{2n}-\\binom{2n}{n}^2\\right).\\]\n\n\n\nConjectured by Erd\\H{o}s, Ko, and Rado \\cite{ErKoRa61}. This inequality would be best possible, as shown by taking $\\mathcal{F}$ to be the collection of all subsets of $[4n]$ of size $2n$ containing at least $n+1$ elements from $[2n]$.\n\nProved by Ahlswede and Khachatrian \\cite{AhKh97}, who more generally showed the following. Let $2\\leq t\\leq k\\leq m$ and let $r\\geq 0$ be such that\\[\\frac{1}{r+1}\\leq \\frac{m-2k+2t-2}{(t-1)(k-t+1)}< \\frac{1}{r}.\\]The largest possible family of subsets of $[m]$ of size $k$, such that the pairwise intersections have size at least $t$, is the family of all subsets of $[m]$ of size $k$ which contain at least $t+r$ elements from $\\{1,\\ldots,t+2r\\}$.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AhKh97] Ahlswede, Rudolf and Khachatrian, Levon H., The complete intersection theorem for systems of finite sets.
