    "historicalContext": "**The Erdős-Ko-Rado Legacy**\n\nThe 1961 Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem is one of the foundational results in extremal set theory. It characterizes the largest family of k-subsets of [n] where every pair intersects. This problem extends that to require intersection size ≥ 2.\n\n**The $500 Conjecture**: Erdős, Ko, and Rado conjectured the exact maximum for families of 2n-subsets of [4n] with pairwise 2-intersections. This was open for 36 years until Ahlswede and Khachatrian's breakthrough.\n\n**The Complete Intersection Theorem (1997)**: Ahlswede and Khachatrian didn't just prove this special case - they solved the general problem for all parameters m, k, t. Their result determines the maximum family of k-subsets of [m] with pairwise t-intersections, for all valid parameters.\n\n**Significance**: This is considered one of the major achievements in extremal combinatorics, completing a program started by Erdős, Ko, and Rado in 1961.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet F be a family of subsets of [4n] such that:\n- |A| = 2n for all A ∈ F\n- |A ∩ B| ≥ 2 for all A, B ∈ F\n\nThen:\n|F| ≤ ½(C(4n,2n) - C(2n,n)²)\n\n**Extremal Construction**: Take all 2n-subsets of [4n] containing at least n+1 elements from [2n]. This achieves the bound.\n\n**Answer**: PROVED by Ahlswede-Khachatrian (1997)\n\n**General Theorem**: For 2 ≤ t ≤ k ≤ m, the maximum t-intersecting family of k-subsets of [m] consists of all k-subsets containing at least t+r elements from a fixed (t+2r)-set, where r is determined by a specific inequality.",
    "proofStrategy": "**The Ahlswede-Khachatrian Approach**\n\nThe proof of the Complete Intersection Theorem uses several sophisticated techniques:\n\n1. **Shifting/Compression**: Transform any family to a 'shifted' family without decreasing size or violating intersection properties.\n\n2. **Generating Sets**: Analyze the structure of shifted t-intersecting families through their generating sets.\n\n3. **Inductive Framework**: Build the solution by carefully analyzing how optimal families are structured.\n\n4. **The Critical Ratio**: The parameter r is determined by:\n   1/(r+1) ≤ (m-2k+2t-2)/((t-1)(k-t+1)) < 1/r\n\n5. **Optimality Proof**: Show that the 'star-like' construction (sets containing many elements from a fixed small set) achieves the maximum.\n\n**Key Insight**: The extremal families have a specific hierarchical structure determined by the ratio of parameters.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem (t=1) was just the beginning - t≥2 required 36 more years",
      "The extremal construction is 'star-like': sets must contain many elements from a fixed core",
      "The critical parameter r creates phase transitions in the structure of optimal families",
      "Shifting/compression techniques reduce the problem to analyzing structured families",
      "The $500 prize reflected the difficulty - this was a major open problem for decades",
      "The general theorem covers all valid (m,k,t) parameters, not just this special case"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #83 asked for the maximum size of a family of 2n-subsets of [4n] with pairwise 2-intersections.
