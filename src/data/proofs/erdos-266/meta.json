There exists some integer $t\\geq 1$ such that\\[\\sum \\frac{1}{a_n+t}\\]is irrational.\n\n\n\nThis conjecture is due to Stolarsky.\n\nA negative answer was proved by Kova\\v{c} and Tao \\cite{KoTa24}, who proved even more: there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_n$ such that\\[\\sum \\frac{1}{a_n+t}\\]converges to a rational number for every $t\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ (with $t\\neq -a_n$ for all $n$).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[KoTa24] Kova\\vC, V. and Tao T., On several irrationality problems for Ahmes series. arXiv:2406.17593 (2024).\n\n\nBack to the problem",
