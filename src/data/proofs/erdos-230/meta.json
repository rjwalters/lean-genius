  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Newman conjectured in 1957/1961 that for unimodular polynomials (all coefficients on the unit circle), the sup norm on the unit circle must exceed √n by a fixed multiplicative factor (1+c). This appeared as Problem 4.31 in Halberstam (1974). Surprisingly, Kahane (1980) disproved this by constructing 'ultraflat' polynomials where the sup norm is only (1+o(1))√n. Bombieri and Bourgain (2009) improved the error term to O(n^{7/18}).",
    "problemStatement": "Let P(z) = Σ_{1≤k≤n} a_k z^k with |a_k| = 1 for all k. Does there exist c > 0 such that max_{|z|=1} |P(z)| ≥ (1+c)√n for all n ≥ 2?",
    "proofStrategy": "The problem is DISPROVED. The formalization captures: (1) Unimodular polynomials and their evaluation, (2) The trivial √n lower bound from Parseval, (3) The false Erdős-Newman conjecture, (4) Kahane's ultraflat polynomial theorem showing the conjecture is false, (5) Bombieri-Bourgain's improved error bounds.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #230 asked whether unimodular polynomials must have sup norm at least (1+c)√n for some universal c > 0. Kahane (1980) disproved this by constructing 'ultraflat' polynomials where the sup norm approaches √n arbitrarily closely. The problem is SOLVED (answer: NO).",
    "implications": "Ultraflat polynomials are a surprising phenomenon in harmonic analysis. They show that unimodular polynomials can have remarkably uniform behavior on the unit circle. The Bombieri-Bourgain improvement to O(n^{7/18}) error suggests even flatter polynomials may exist.",
