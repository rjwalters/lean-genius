  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "An integer n is **r-powerful** (or r-full) if whenever a prime p divides n, we have p^r also divides n. For example, 8 = 2³ is 3-powerful since its only prime factor 2 appears with exponent 3.\n\nErdős posed a fascinating question about sums of r-powerful numbers: for r ≥ 4, can r-2 coprime r-powerful numbers sum to another r-powerful number? This connects to Euler's 1769 conjecture that k-1 k-th powers cannot sum to a k-th power.\n\nThe Euler conjecture was dramatically disproved in 1967 when Lander and Parkin found 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5 by computer search. Since perfect k-th powers are trivially k-powerful, this inspired investigation of the more general r-powerful case.\n\nCambie found explicit examples for r = 5, 7, and 8, but whether such solutions exist for all r ≥ 4 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "An integer $n$ is **$r$-powerful** if for every prime $p$ dividing $n$, we have $p^r | n$. Equivalently, all exponents in the prime factorization are $\\geq r$.\n\n**Main Questions** (OPEN):\n1. If $r \\geq 4$, can the sum of $r-2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers be itself $r$-powerful?\n2. Are there infinitely many such sums for each $r \\geq 4$?\n\n**Related Result** (SOLVED - Nitaj 1995):\nAre there infinitely many triples of coprime 3-powerful numbers $a, b, c$ with $a + b = c$? **YES** - Nitaj proved this, with examples like $2^3 \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 73^3 + 271^3 = 919^3$.\n\n**Known Examples** (Cambie):\n- $r = 5$: $3761^5 = 2^8 \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^7 + 2^{12} \\cdot 23^6 + 11^5 \\cdot 13^5$\n- Solutions also found for $r = 7$ and $r = 8$",
    "proofStrategy": "Since the main existence question is open, we cannot prove it. Our formalization:\n\n1. **Defines r-powerful numbers** via prime divisibility: $\\forall p$ prime, $p | n \\Rightarrow p^r | n$\n2. **Verifies concrete examples** (8, 27, 32) using omega and divisibility bounds\n3. **Defines Erdos939Sums** capturing the valid sum structure\n4. **States the conjectures** (existence, infinitude) as axioms\n5. **Records Nitaj's result** on 3-powerful triples\n6. **Proves Lander-Parkin** counterexample to Euler's conjecture via native_decide\n7. **Shows perfect powers are r-powerful** by prime factorization argument",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**r-Powerful Structure**: A number is r-powerful iff all prime exponents are ≥ r. This includes all r-th powers (trivially) but also products like 2^4 · 3^5 (which is 4-powerful).",
      "**Euler's Conjecture**: The 1967 Lander-Parkin counterexample 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5 showed that k-1 k-th powers CAN sum to a k-th power.",
      "**Cambie's Discovery**: Explicit solutions for r = 5, 7, 8 suggest the answer to the existence question might be YES, but no proof covers all r ≥ 4.",
      "**Nitaj's Triples**: The 3-powerful case (r = 3, looking for a + b = c) has infinitely many solutions, but this doesn't directly answer the r ≥ 4 case."
