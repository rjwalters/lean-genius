An $r$-powerful number $n$ is one such that if $p\\mid n$ then $p^r\\mid n$.\n\nIf $r\\geq 4$ then can the sum of $r-2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers ever be itself $r$-powerful? Are there at most finitely many such solutions?\n\nAre there infinitely many triples of coprime $3$-powerful numbers $a,b,c$ such that $a+b=c$?\n\n\n\nThe answer to the third question is yes: Nitaj \\cite{Ni95} has proved that there are infinitely many triples of coprime $3$-powerful numbers $a,b,c$ such that $a+b=c$, such as\\[2^3\\cdot 3^5\\cdot 73^3+271^3 = 919^3.\\]In Nitaj's construction at least two of $a,b,c$ are perfect cubes. Cohn \\cite{Co98} constructed infinitely many such triples, none of which are perfect cubes. An alternative construction was given by Walsh \\cite{Wa24}.\n\nEuler had conjectured that the sum of $k-1$ many $k$th powers is never a $k$th power, but this is false for $k=5$, as Lander and Parkin \\cite{LaPa67} found\\[27^5+84^5+110^5+133^5=144^5.\\]Cambie has found several examples of the sum of $r-2$ coprime $r$-powerful numbers being itself $r$-powerful. For example when $r=5$\\[3^761^5=2^83^{10}5^7+2^{12}23^6+11^513^5.\\]Cambie has also found solutions when $r=7$ or $r=8$ (the latter even with the sum of $5$ $8$-powerful numbers being $8$-powerful).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Co98] Cohn, J.
