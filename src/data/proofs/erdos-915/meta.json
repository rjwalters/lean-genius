Must $G$ contain two points which are connected by $m$ disjoint paths?\n\n\n\nA conjecture of Bollob\\'{a}s and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{BoEr62}. This would be the best possible, as demonstrated by $n$ copies of $K_m$ which share a single vertex (but are otherwise disjoint). It is unclear whether disjoint here is to mean edge-disjoint or (internally) vertex-disjoint. The above construction is valid for either interpretation.\n\nLet $k_m(n)$ denote the minimum number of edges such that any graph with $n$ vertices and $k_m(n)$ edges contains two vertices which are connected by at least $m$ vertex-disjoint paths. One can similarly consider $\\ell_m(n)$, defined similarly but with edge-disjoint paths (so that in particular $\\ell_m(n)\\leq k_m(n)$).\n\nWe summarise the known results below, first for $k_m(n)$, then for $\\ell_m(n)$.\n{UL}\n{LI}The conjecture in the main problem is that, for all $m\\geq 2$,\\[k_m(1+(m-1)n)=1+\\binom{m}{2}n.\\](In particular, $k_m(n)=\\frac{m}{2}n+O(1)$.)\n{/LI}\n{LI} It is trivial that $k_2(n)=n$.{/LI}\n{LI} B\\'{a}rtfai \\cite{Ba60} proved that $k_3(2n)=3n-1$ and $k_3(2n+1)=3n+1$.{/LI}\n{LI} Bollob\\'{a}s \\cite{Bo66} proved $k_4(n)=2n-1$. {/LI}\n{LI} Leonard \\cite{Le73} disproved this conjecture for $m=5$, giving an {IMAGE=915Leonard,explicit counterexample} with $57$ vertices and $141$ edges. More generally, Leonard proved the existence of a $c>0$ such that, for all large $n$, $k_5(n)>(\\frac{5}{2}+c)n-O(1)$ (an examination of his paper suggests that one can take $c=\\frac{3}{80}$).{/LI}\n{LI} S{\\o}rensen and Thomassen \\cite{SoTh74} proved that $k_5(n)=\\lfloor\\frac{8}{3}n\\rfloor-3$ for $n\\geq 13$. They also prove that the conjectured bound of Bollob\\'{a}s and Erd\\H{o}s holds if the graph is $3$-connected.{/LI}\n{LI} Mader \\cite{Ma73} disproved the conjecture in general, proving that, for all $m\\geq 6$ and any $C>0$, there exists an $n$ such that $k_m(n)> \\frac{m}{2}n+C$.{/LI}\n{LI} S{\\o}rensen and Thomassen \\cite{SoTh74} proved that, for any fixed $m\\geq 2$, for infinitely many $n$,\\[k_m(n) > \\frac{m(m-1)-2}{2m-3}(n-m).\\]{/UL}\nThe results for $\\ell_m$ are summarised below.\n{UL}\n{LI} Leonard \\cite{Le72} proved $\\ell_m(n)=k_m(n)$ for $2\\leq m\\leq 4$ and $\\ell_5(2n)=5n-2$ and $\\ell_5(2n+1)=5n+1$.{/LI}\n{LI} Leonard \\cite{Le73b} proved $\\ell_6(n)=3n-2$. {/LI}\n{LI} Mader \\cite{Ma73} proved that if a graph with $n$ vertices has\\[> \\frac{m}{2}(n-1)-\\frac{1}{2}(e_0(G)+\\cdots+e_{m-2}(G))\\]edges then $G$ contains two vertices connected by $m$ edge-disjoint paths (where $e_r(G)$ counts the number of vertices of degree $\\leq r$). In particular, this confirms (and is stronger than) the conjecture, and in general establishes\\[\\ell_m(n)=\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2}(n-1)+1\\right\\rfloor\\]for all $m\\geq 2$.\n{/LI}\n{/UL}\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ba60] P.
