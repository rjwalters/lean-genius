    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #915: Disjoint Paths in Graphs**\n\nThe Bollobás-Erdős conjecture (1962) is a landmark problem in extremal graph theory concerning the minimum number of edges needed to guarantee m disjoint paths between some pair of vertices. The problem connects to Menger's theorem, which equates the maximum number of disjoint paths to the minimum cut size.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Bártfai (1960): First resolved the m = 3 case before the general conjecture was formulated\n- Bollobás-Erdős (1962): Stated the general conjecture based on the extremal construction of n copies of K_m sharing a single vertex\n- Bollobás (1966): Proved the m = 4 case, the last small case to hold\n- Leonard (1972-1973): Computed exact ℓ_m values for small m, then disproved the vertex-disjoint conjecture for m = 5 with an explicit 57-vertex counterexample\n- Mader (1973): Independently disproved for m ≥ 6 via asymptotic arguments, and completely solved the edge-disjoint version\n- Sørensen-Thomassen (1974): Found the exact formula k_5(n) = ⌊8n/3⌋ - 3, and showed the conjecture holds for 3-connected graphs\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe extremal construction (n copies of K_m sharing one vertex) has exactly 1 + (m-1)n vertices and 1 + C(m,2)n edges but contains no m vertex-disjoint paths. This shows the conjectured threshold is at least a lower bound. The surprise is that for m ≥ 5, the actual threshold k_m(n) grows strictly faster than (m/2)n.",
