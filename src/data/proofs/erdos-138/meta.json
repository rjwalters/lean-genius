  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Van der Waerden's theorem (1927) guarantees that for any k ≥ 1, there exists N such that any 2-coloring of {1,...,N} contains a monochromatic k-term arithmetic progression. The van der Waerden number W(k) is the minimum such N. Erdős posed this problem in 1980, asking whether W(k) grows faster than any exponential function. The problem connects to fundamental questions in Ramsey theory about the tradeoff between chromatic complexity and arithmetic structure.",
    "problemStatement": "Does W(k)^{1/k} → ∞ as k → ∞? Equivalently, do the van der Waerden numbers grow faster than any exponential c^k?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines van der Waerden numbers using Mathlib's Finset infrastructure. Known bounds are axiomatized: Berlekamp's lower bound W(p+1) ≥ p·2^p for primes p, Gowers' tower-type upper bound from his Szemerédi proof, and the Kozik-Shabanov general lower bound W(k) ≫ 2^k. The main conjecture is stated using Filter.Tendsto. Related questions from Erdős (1980-1981) about W(k+1)/W(k), W(k+1)-W(k), and W(k)/2^k are also formalized.",

The main conjecture that W(k)^{1/k} → ∞ remains unresolved.",
