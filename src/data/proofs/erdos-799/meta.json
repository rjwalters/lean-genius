  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #799: List Chromatic Number**\n\nThis problem concerns the list chromatic number (also called the choice number) of random graphs.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős, Rubin, Taylor: Original problem formulation asking if χ_L(G) = o(n)\n- Alon [Al92] (1992): First proof that χ_L(G) ≪ (log log n / log n) · n\n- Alon, Krivelevich, Sudakov [AKS99] (1999): Tight bound χ_L(G) ≍ n/log n\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- χ_L(G) = list chromatic number = minimum k for k-list colorability\n- k-list colorable = for any k-sized color lists, a valid coloring exists\n- G(n, 1/2) = Erdős-Rényi random graph with n vertices and edge probability 1/2\n\nThe problem asked whether the list chromatic number grows sublinearly (o(n)) for almost all graphs. This was resolved affirmatively with precise asymptotics.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nThe list chromatic number $\\chi_L(G)$ is the minimal $k$ such that for any assignment of a list of $k$ colours to each vertex, a proper coloring exists where each vertex uses a color from its list.\n\n**Question:** Is $\\chi_L(G) = o(n)$ for almost all graphs on $n$ vertices?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nAlon (1992) proved: $\\chi_L(G) \\ll \\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n} \\cdot n$ almost surely.\n\nAlon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (1999) proved: $\\chi_L(G) \\asymp \\frac{n}{\\log n}$ almost surely.\n\nThis gives the precise order of magnitude for random graphs.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **List Coloring Definitions:** Define ColorListAssignment, IsValidListColoring, IsListColorable, and listChromaticNumber.\n\n2. **Comparison with χ(G):** Establish that χ_L(G) ≥ χ(G) always holds.\n\n3. **Random Graph Results:** Axiomatize Alon's 1992 result and the 1999 improvement.\n\n4. **Why Axioms:** The probabilistic proofs require the Lovász Local Lemma, concentration inequalities, and semi-random methods beyond Mathlib's current scope.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**List Chromatic Number:** Unlike ordinary chromatic number, each vertex may have a different palette of available colors",
      "**Always at least χ(G):** Since uniform lists reduce to ordinary coloring, χ_L(G) ≥ χ(G)",
      "**Can be much larger:** For K_{n,n}, χ = 2 but χ_L ≈ log₂ n + 1, showing arbitrarily large gaps",
      "**Random Graph Behavior:** For G(n, 1/2), both χ(G) and χ_L(G) are Θ(n/log n), differing by factor ~2.885",
      "**Sublinear Growth:** The answer is YES: χ_L(G) = o(n) for almost all graphs"
