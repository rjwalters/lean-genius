  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp (1993) introduced the concept of Ramsey size linear graphs and proved that graphs with at most n+1 edges are Ramsey size linear. Problem #567 asks about three specific graphs that are natural test cases beyond the EFRS threshold: the 3-cube Q₃, the complete bipartite K₃,₃, and H₅ = K₄* (C₅ with two chords).",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that r̂(G, H) = O(m) for G ∈ {Q₃, K₃,₃, H₅} and every H with m edges and no isolated vertices?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define Q₃, K₃,₃, H₅ as concrete graphs, axiomatize the size Ramsey number, define Ramsey size linearity, and state the three questions. We record partial results by Bradač–Gishboliner–Sudakov on K₄ subdivisions and EFRS on sparse graphs.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Q₃ has 12 edges and 8 vertices — the smallest hypercube that is not trivially Ramsey size linear",
      "K₃,₃ has 9 edges — Erdős specifically highlighted this bipartite case",
      "H₅ = K₄* is a subdivision of K₄, so recent results by Bradač et al. may apply",
      "EFRS proved linearity for graphs with ≤ n+1 edges; these three exceed that threshold",
      "This is a special case of Problem #566 on general Ramsey size linearity for sparse graphs"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #567 asks whether three specific graphs — Q₃, K₃,₃, H₅ — are Ramsey size linear. Recent progress on K₄ subdivisions addresses H₅, but Q₃ and K₃,₃ remain open.",
    "implications": "Resolution would extend the EFRS theory of Ramsey size linear graphs, connecting to structural Ramsey theory and the broader question of which graphs have linear size Ramsey numbers.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is Q₃ Ramsey size linear?",
      "Is K₃,₃ Ramsey size linear?",
      "Does the Bradač–Gishboliner–Sudakov result fully resolve the H₅ case?",
