Is it true that the equation\\[(p-1)!+a^{p-1}=p^k\\]has only finitely many solutions?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham remark that it is probably true that in general $(p-1)!+a^{p-1}$ is rarely a power at all (although this can happen, for example $6!+2^6=28^2$).\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham ask this allowing the case $p=2$, but this is presumably an oversight, since clearly there are infinitely many solutions to this equation when $p=2$.\n\nBrindza and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{BrEr91} proved that there are finitely many such solutions. Yu and Liu \\cite{YuLi96} showed that the only solutions are\\[2!+1^2=3\\]\\[2!+5^2=3^3\\]and\\[4!+1^4=5^2.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BrEr91] Brindza, B. and Erd\\H{o}s, P., On some {D}iophantine problems involving powers and\nfactorials.
