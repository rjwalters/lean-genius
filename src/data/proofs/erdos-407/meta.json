Is it true that $w(n)$ is bounded by some absolute constant?\n\n\n\nA conjecture originally due to Newman.\n\nThis is true, and was proved by Evertse, Gy\\\"{o}ry, Stewart, and Tijdeman \\cite{EGST88}.\n\nQuantitative bounds were provided by Tijdeman and Wang \\cite{TiWa88}, who proved that (if $w(n)$ only counts distinct solutions, where we call two solutions distinct if the sets $\\{2^a,3^b,2^{c}3^d\\}$ are distinct) then $w(n) \\leq 4$ for all large $n$.\n\nThis was made effective by Bajpai and Bennett \\cite{BaBe24}, who proved that $w(n)\\leq 4$ if $n\\geq 131082$ and $w(n)\\leq 9$ for all $n$. (The largest $n$ for which $w(n)=9$ is $299$.) There are infinitely many $n$ with $w(n)=4$, given by the identities\n\\begin{align*}\n2^{a-1}+3^b+2^{a-1}3^0\n&= 2^{a-2}+3^b+2^{a-2}3^1\\\\\n&=2^a+3^{b-1}+2\\cdot 3^{b-1}\\\\\n&=2^a+3^{b-2}+2^33^{b-2}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaBe24] Bajpai, Prajeet and Bennett, Michael A., Effective {$S$}-unit equations beyond three terms: {N}ewman's\nconjecture.
