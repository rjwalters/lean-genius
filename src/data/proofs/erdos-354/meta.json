Is the multiset\\[\\{ \\lfloor \\alpha\\rfloor,\\lfloor 2\\alpha\\rfloor,\\lfloor 4\\alpha\\rfloor,\\ldots\\}\\cup \\{ \\lfloor \\beta\\rfloor,\\lfloor 2\\beta\\rfloor,\\lfloor 4\\beta\\rfloor,\\ldots\\}\\]complete? That is, can all sufficiently large natural numbers $n$ be written as\\[n=\\sum_{s\\in S}\\lfloor 2^s\\alpha\\rfloor+\\sum_{t\\in T}\\lfloor 2^t\\beta\\rfloor\\]for some finite $S,T\\subset \\mathbb{N}$?\n\nWhat if $2$ is replaced by some $\\gamma\\in(1,2)$?\n\n\n\nThis question was first mentioned by Graham \\cite{Gr71}.\n\nHegyv\\'{a}ri \\cite{He89} proved that this holds if $\\alpha=m/2^n$ is a dyadic rational and $\\beta$ is not. He later \\cite{He91} proved that, for any fixed $\\alpha>0$, the set of $\\beta$ for which this holds either has measure $0$ or infinite measure. In \\cite{He94} he proved that the set of $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ for which the corresponding set of sums does not contain an infinite arithmetic progression has cardinality continuum.\n\nHegyv\\'{a}ri \\cite{He89} proved that the sequence is not complete if $\\alpha\\geq 2$ and $\\beta =2^k\\alpha$ for some $k\\geq 0$. Jiang and Ma \\cite{JiMa24} and Fang and He \\cite{FaHe25} prove that the sequence is not complete if $1<\\alpha<2$ and $\\beta=2^k\\alpha$ for some sufficiently large $k$.\n\nIt is likely (and Hegyv\\'{a}ri conjectures) that the assumption $\\alpha/\\beta$ irrational can be weakened to $\\alpha/\\beta \\neq 2^k$ and either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ not a dyadic rational.\n\nIn the comments van Doorn proves the sequence is complete if $\\alpha < 2<\\beta<3$, and also proves that if either $\\alpha$ or $\\beta$ is not a dyadic rational then the corresponding sequence with ceiling functions replacing the floor functions is complete.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FaHe25] Fang, J.-H. and He, J.-Y., On a problem of {E}rd\\H{o}s and {G}raham.
