Is it true that\\[\\limsup S(n)=\\infty?\\]\n\n\n\nIf $s(n)$ denotes the largest integer such that $\\binom{n}{k}$ is divisible by $p^{s(n)}$ for some prime $p$ for at least one $1\\leq k<n$ then it is easy to see that $s(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$ (and in fact that $s(n) \\asymp \\log n$).\n\nThis problem was solved in the affirmative by Cambie, Kova\\v{c}, and Tao (see the comment section). A Lean formalisation of their proof is available here.\n\nThere are other simpler constructions: for example, $3^{2^k}$ for arbitrarily large $k$ (see this discussion).\n\nSee also [175].\n\n\nBack to the problem",
