  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #744 originates from a question posed by Erdős, Hajnal, and Szemerédi in the early 1980s (references [Er81] and [EHS82]). The problem concerns a fundamental question about the structure of k-chromatic critical graphs: how many edges must be removed to make such a graph bipartite? The function f_k(n) measures the minimum number of edge deletions needed across all k-critical graphs on n vertices.\n\nThe case k = 3 is trivial: the only 3-critical graphs are odd cycles, and removing any single edge yields a path (which is bipartite), so f_3(n) = 1. For k ≥ 4, early results were encouraging for the conjecture. Gallai (1968) established that f_4(n) ≤ O(√n), and Lovász extended this to f_k(n) ≤ O(n^{1-1/(k-2)}) for general k. Erdős and collaborators conjectured that f_k(n) → ∞ as n → ∞, and specifically asked whether f_4(n) grows at least as fast as log(n).\n\nIn a surprising turn, Rödl and Tuza disproved the conjecture entirely in 1985. They showed that for every fixed k ≥ 3, the function f_k(n) is eventually constant: f_k(n) = C(k-1, 2) = (k-1)(k-2)/2 for all sufficiently large n. This means the non-bipartiteness of large k-critical graphs is concentrated in a bounded substructure, regardless of the total graph size.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f_k(n)$ be the minimum number of edges whose deletion makes a $k$-chromatic critical graph on $n$ vertices bipartite.\n\nDoes $f_k(n) \\to \\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$?\n\n**Answer:** NO.\n\n**Rödl-Tuza Theorem (1985):** For all $k \\geq 3$ and sufficiently large $n$:\n$$f_k(n) = \\binom{k-1}{2} = \\frac{(k-1)(k-2)}{2}$$\n\nThe function is eventually constant, not unbounded.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization proceeds in ten parts:\n\n1. **Graph foundations:** We define SimpleGraph' with an adjacency predicate and axiomatize the chromatic number.\n\n2. **Critical graphs:** A graph is k-critical if χ(G) = k and removing any edge reduces the chromatic number. This captures the notion of \"minimal\" k-colorable graphs.\n\n3. **Bipartite characterization:** Bipartite graphs are defined as those with χ(G) ≤ 2, with an axiom connecting this to the absence of odd cycles.\n\n4. **The f_k function:** We define f_k(n) using the known values from Rödl-Tuza, which gives f_k(n) = (k-1)(k-2)/2 for k ≥ 4.\n\n5. **Disproof:** We state the original conjecture formally, axiomatize the Rödl-Tuza theorem, and derive that the conjecture is false. We also show specific instances like f_4 = 3 and f_5 = 6.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Critical Graph Structure:** A k-critical graph is one requiring exactly k colors, where every proper subgraph needs fewer. These are the 'minimal' examples of k-colorability.",
      "**Odd Cycle Case (k=3):** The only 3-critical graphs are odd cycles. Removing one edge gives a path (bipartite), so f_3(n) = 1 — trivially bounded.",
      "**Rödl-Tuza Surprise:** f_k(n) = C(k-1, 2) for large n. The non-bipartiteness doesn't spread as graphs grow; it stays concentrated in a clique of size k-1.",
      "**Bounded vs. Unbounded:** Erdős expected f_k to grow without bound. The answer being a constant — the number of edges in K_{k-1} — was completely unexpected.",
      "**Specific Values:** f_3 = 1, f_4 = 3, f_5 = 6, f_6 = 10, f_7 = 15, following the triangular number pattern C(k-1, 2)."

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #744 asked whether f_k(n) → ∞ as n → ∞, where f_k(n) measures the minimum edge deletions needed to make a k-critical graph bipartite.

    "implications": "The disproof reveals a striking structural property of k-chromatic critical graphs: their non-bipartiteness is concentrated in a bounded region isomorphic to a complete graph on k-1 vertices. No matter how large the critical graph grows, the same fixed number of edge deletions suffices to make it bipartite. This challenges the intuition that larger graphs should have more 'spread out' coloring obstructions.",
