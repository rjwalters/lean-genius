Folkman showed this is false with the counterexample $K_{n,n^2}$, which has $n^3$ edges, and yet every subgraph with $>n^2+\\binom{n}{2}$ edges contains a $C_4$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er71} Erd\\H{o}s revises the conjecture to $m^{2/3}$, and notes $\\gg m^{1/2}$ is trivial. In a footnote he says Szemer\\'{e}di proved this conjecture, but gives no reference, and I could not find such a result in the literature.\n\nThis problem was first solved in the affirmative by Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov \\cite{CFS14b}. A simple proof is given by Hunter in the comments.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFS14b] D. Conlon, J. Fox, and B.
