  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Originally asked by Bollobás and Erdős at the Tihany graph theory colloquium with exponent 3/4. Folkman disproved this using K_{n,n²}: it has n³ edges but every C₄-free subgraph has only O(n²) edges. Erdős revised the conjecture to exponent 2/3 in 1971, noting that 1/2 is trivial. He mentioned Szemerédi proved it but gave no reference.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every graph with m edges contain a subgraph with ≫ m^{2/3} edges which contains no C₄ (4-cycle)?",
    "proofStrategy": "Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov (2014) proved the result using dependent random choice and the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem. The idea is to carefully select a subgraph that avoids 4-cycles while retaining many edges. A simpler proof was later given by Hunter in the problem's comments.",
