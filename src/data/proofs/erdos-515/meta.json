    "summary": "Erdős Problem #515 asked whether, for a transcendental entire function f, there exists a locally rectifiable path C → ∞ such that ∫_C |f(z)|^{-λ} dz < ∞ for ALL λ > 0. The answer is YES, proved by Lewis, Rossi, and Weitsman (1984). This completed a progression: Huber (1957) showed a path exists for each λ separately, Zhang (1977) proved a single path works for finite order functions, and LRW proved the general case.",
