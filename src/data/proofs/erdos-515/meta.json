Does there exist a locally rectifiable path $C$ tending to infinity such that, for every $\\lambda>0$, the integral\\[\\int_C \\lvert f(z)\\rvert^{-\\lambda} \\mathrm{d}z\\]is finite?\n\n\n\nHuber \\cite{Hu57} proved that for every $\\lambda>0$ there is such a path $C_\\lambda$ such that this integral is finite.\n\nThis is true. The case when $f$ has finite order was proved by Zhang \\cite{Zh77}. The general case was proved by Lewis, Rossi, and Weitsman \\cite{LRW84}, who in fact proved this with $\\lvert f\\rvert$ replaced by $e^u$ where $u$ is any subharmonic function.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Hu57] Huber, Alfred, On subharmonic functions and differential geometry in the large.
