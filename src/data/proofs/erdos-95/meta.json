    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $x_1,\\ldots,x_n\\in\\mathbb{R}^2$ determine the set of distances $\\{u_1,\\ldots,u_t\\}$. Suppose $u_i$ appears as the distance between $f(u_i)$ many pairs of points. Then for all $\\epsilon>0$\\[\\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \\ll_\\epsilon n^{3+\\epsilon}.\\]\n\n\n\nThe case when the points determine a convex polygon was solved by Fishburn \\cite{Al63}. Note it is trivial that $\\sum f(u_i)=\\binom{n}{2}$. Solved by Guth and Katz \\cite{GuKa15} who proved the upper bound\\[ \\sum_i f(u_i)^2 \\ll n^3\\log n.\\]See also [94].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Al63] Altman, E., On a problem of P. Erd\\H{o}s.
