  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this problem in [ErGr80, p. 59] about the largest subsets of {1,...,⌊cn⌋} that avoid representing n as a subset sum. The question combines subset-sum theory with irregular dependence on n.",
    "problemStatement": "Let c > 0, n large. What is max |A| for A ⊆ {1,...,⌊cn⌋} with n ∉ {∑_{a ∈ B} a : B ⊆ A}? Does this depend on n irregularly?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsSubsetSum and NonRepresenting, then maxNonReprSize as the sup of cardinalities over the powerset filtered by non-representation. The conjecture about irregularity is stated as non-monotonicity. Asymptotic questions use Mathlib's IsBigO and IsTheta.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The maximum non-representing subset size may grow as Θ(√n)",
      "Irregular dependence on n suggests the function is not monotone",
      "For small c < 1, eventually all subsets are non-representing (sums too small)",
      "The problem connects subset-sum avoidance to additive combinatorics"
