  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1979 [Er79e]. Prime chains arise from the multiplicative structure of cyclic groups: if p_{i+1} ≡ 1 (mod p_i), then Z/p_{i+1}Z contains a cyclic subgroup of order p_i.\n\nFord, Konyagin, and Luca [FKL10] conducted an extensive study of prime chain growth, establishing various bounds. The problem connects to Linnik's theorem on the least prime in arithmetic progressions.\n\nRelated: OEIS A061092, Cunningham chains.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet $p_1 < p_2 < \\cdots$ be a sequence of primes where $p_{i+1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p_i}$.\n\n**Question 1:** Is it true that $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} p_k^{1/k} = \\infty$?\n\n**Question 2:** Does there exist such a sequence with $p_k \\leq \\exp(k(\\log k)^{1+o(1)})$?\n\nBoth questions remain OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Prime Chains:** IsPrimeChain(p) := StrictMono p ∧ all primes ∧ p_{i+1} % p_i = 1\n\n2. **Growth Questions:** Question1 (k-th root → ∞) and Question2 (sub-doubly-exponential)\n\n3. **Known Bounds:** Axiomatize Linnik's theorem, greedy algorithm bounds, FKL analysis\n\n4. **Related Structures:** Cunningham chains as special prime chains\n\n5. **Formal Statements:** Precise Tendsto formulation from formal-conjectures",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Greedy Bound:** Using Linnik's theorem, greedy gives p_k ≤ exp(exp(O(k)))",
      "**Conjectural Improvement:** If least prime ≡ 1 (mod p) is O(p(log p)^C), get desired bound",
      "**Exponential Lower:** Any prime chain grows at least exponentially: p_k ≥ c^k",
      "**Cunningham Chains:** p, 2p+1, 4p+3,... are prime chains when all terms are prime",
      "**Gap:** Large gap between known lower (c^k) and upper (exp(exp(Ck))) bounds"
