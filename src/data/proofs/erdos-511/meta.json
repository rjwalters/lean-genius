Is it true that, for every $c>1$, the set\\[\\{ z\\in \\mathbb{C} : \\lvert f(z)\\rvert< 1\\}\\]has at most $O_c(1)$ many connected components of diameter $>c$ (where the implied constant is in particular independent of $n$)?\n\n\n\nThis is Problem 4.9 in \\cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\\H{o}s.\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranien \\cite{EHP58}, who ask more generally whether\\[\\sum_C \\mathrm{diam}(C) \\leq n2^{1/n}\\]and\\[\\sum_{C}\\max(0, \\mathrm{diam}(C)-1)\\ll 1\\]for all such $f$, where $C$ ranges over the connected components of the set in question. The example $f(z)=z^n-1$ has $\\sum_C \\mathrm{diam}(C)=(1+o(1))n2^{1/n}$.\n\nThey also asked whether, if the roots of $f$ are all in the disc $\\{\\lvert z\\rvert\\leq 1\\}$, the total number of connected components with diameter $>1$ is absolutely bounded, but noted in an addendum that the answer is no: consider $z^n+1$ and move the zeros $e^{i\\pi/n}$ and $e^{-i\\pi/n}$ a short distance along the circle towards $1$. The set $\\{z: \\lvert f(z)\\rvert \\leq 1\\}$ for $f(z)=z^n+1$ looks like $n$ 'leaves' joined at $0$, and this moving of two roots makes $\\approx n/2$ of the leaves become disconnected at $0$. Each of the resulting components has diameter $>2^{1/n}-\\epsilon$, and hence there are $\\gg n$ components of diameter $>1$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er61} Erd\\H{o}s asks the weaker question given here, with the definition of the set altered so that $<1$ is replaced by $\\leq 1$.\n\nPommerenke \\cite{Po61} proved that the answer is no to most of these questions, by showing that, for any $0<d<4$ and $k\\geq 1$ there exist monic polynomials $f\\in \\mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $\\{z: \\lvert f(z)\\rvert\\leq 1\\}$ has at least $k$ connected components of diameter $\\geq d$.\n\nThis was independently proved by Huang \\cite{Hu25} (unaware of the previous work of Pommerenke). P\\'{o}lya \\cite{Po28} showed that $4$ is the best possible here, in that no connected component can have diameter $>4$.\n\nA picture of the set in question for $z^5-1$ is {IMAGE=511petals,here}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHP58] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Herzog, F. and Piranian, G., Metric properties of polynomials.
