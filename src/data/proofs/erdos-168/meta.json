What is\\[ \\lim_{N\\to \\infty}\\frac{F(N)}{N}?\\]Is this limit irrational?\n\n\n\nThis limit was proved to exist by Graham, Spencer, and Witsenhausen \\cite{GSW77}, who showed it is equal to\\[\\frac{1}{3}\\sum_{k\\in K}\\frac{1}{d_k},\\]where $d_1<d_2<\\cdots $are the $3$-smooth numbers and $K$ is the set of $k$ for which $f(k)>f(k-1)$, where $f$ counts the largest subset of $\\{d_1,\\ldots,d_k\\}$ that avoids $\\{n,2n,3n\\}$.\n\nSimilar questions can be asked for the density or upper density of infinite sets without such configurations.\n\nThe limit can be estimated by elementary arguments (see the comments). Eberhard has used the formula of \\cite{GSW77} mentioned above to calculate the value of the limit as\\[0.800965\\cdots.\\]This problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GSW77] Graham, R. and Spencer, J. and Witsenhausen, H., On Extremal Density Theorems for Linear Forms.
