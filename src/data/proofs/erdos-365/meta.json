  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked Mahler if infinitely many consecutive powerful pairs exist. Mahler immediately showed yes via Pell equation x²-8y²=1. Erdős then asked if all such pairs come from Pell solutions. Golomb (1970) found the first counterexample: 12167=23³ and 12168=2³·3²·13². Walker (1976) proved infinitely many non-Pell counterexamples exist via 7³x²=3³y²+1.",
    "problemStatement": "Q1: Do all pairs of consecutive powerful numbers n, n+1 come from Pell equations? Equivalently, must either n or n+1 be a square? Q2: Is the number of such n ≤ x bounded by (log x)^O(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines powerful numbers (p² | n for all primes p | n), proves basic properties, and records the counterexamples. Golomb's counterexample and Walker's infinite family are axiomatized. The Pell equation connection is formalized.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Q1 is FALSE: Golomb found 12167=23³, 12168=2³·3²·13² (neither square)",
      "Walker: infinitely many counterexamples via 7³x² = 3³y² + 1",
      "Most pairs DO come from Pell equations, but not all",
      "Q2 expected YES from Pell equation theory",

    "implications": "Consecutive powerful pairs have rich structure beyond simple Pell equations. The variety of Pell-like equations (7³x² = 3³y² + 1, etc.) contribute additional pairs.",
