  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1998, noting that f(n) = ∑ τ(2^k − 1) likely has no simple asymptotic formula due to its erratic growth. The problem connects the divisor function to the arithmetic of Mersenne numbers, a topic with deep ties to prime number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Define f(n) = ∑_{k=1}^n τ(2^k − 1). Does f(2n)/f(n) tend to infinity as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define the divisor function, the Mersenne divisor sum f(n), and the ratio f(2n)/f(n). We state the divergence conjecture and record Kovač–Luca's result that lim sup = ∞.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #893 asks whether the cumulative divisor count of Mersenne numbers grows so fast that f(2n)/f(n) → ∞. Kovač–Luca (2025) proved the ratio is unbounded (lim sup = ∞), but full divergence (lim = ∞) remains open.",
