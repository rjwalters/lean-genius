  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #937: Arithmetic Progressions and Powerful Numbers**\n\nThis problem connects two fundamental concepts: arithmetic progressions and powerful (squarefull) numbers. A number n is powerful if every prime factor appears with exponent at least 2.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Fermat (17th century): Proved no four perfect squares form an arithmetic progression\n- Erdős (1976): Asked about coprime powerful numbers in arithmetic progressions\n- Erdős conjectured behavior for r-powerful numbers depends on r\n- Bajpai-Bennett-Chan (2024): Proved infinitely many 4-term coprime powerful APs exist\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- Without coprimality: Arbitrarily long APs of powerful numbers exist (easy construction)\n- With coprimality: The question becomes much harder and more interesting\n- The r = 2 case (ordinary powerful numbers) was settled in 2024\n\nThe problem beautifully illustrates how adding constraints (coprimality) can transform an easy problem into a deep one.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nAre there infinitely many four-term arithmetic progressions of pairwise coprime powerful numbers?\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nBajpai, Bennett, and Chan (2024) proved:\n1. Infinitely many 4-term APs of coprime powerful numbers exist\n2. Infinitely many 3-term APs of coprime 3-powerful numbers exist\n3. Assuming ABC: Only finitely many 3-term APs of coprime r-powerful numbers for r ≥ 4\n\n**Context:**\n- A number n is powerful if p|n implies p²|n\n- Examples: 1, 4, 8, 9, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, ...",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Powerful Numbers:** Define IsPowerful and IsRPowerful predicates\n\n2. **Arithmetic Progressions:** Define 3-term and 4-term AP predicates\n\n3. **Coprimality:** Define pairwise coprime APs\n\n4. **Main Sets:** Define coprimePowerfulFourTermAPs and coprime3PowerfulThreeTermAPs\n\n5. **Classical Results:** Axiomatize Fermat's theorem on squares\n\n6. **Main Results:** Axiomatize Bajpai-Bennett-Chan theorems\n\n7. **ABC Conditional:** State the conditional result for r ≥ 4\n\nAxioms are needed because the 2024 proof uses sophisticated analytic number theory techniques.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #937 asked whether infinitely many 4-term arithmetic progressions of pairwise coprime powerful numbers exist. The answer is YES, proved by Bajpai, Bennett, and Chan in 2024. The problem illustrates the dramatic effect of adding coprimality constraints: without coprimality, arbitrarily long APs exist by a simple construction; with coprimality, the problem required sophisticated techniques and remained open for decades.",
    "implications": "**Number-Theoretic Significance**\n\n1. **Powerful Number Structure:** The result reveals rich structure in powerful numbers\n\n2. **ABC Conjecture Connection:** The r ≥ 4 case is controlled by ABC\n\n3. **Contrast with Squares:** Powerful numbers are more flexible than perfect squares\n\n4. **Recent Mathematics:** The 2024 proof shows this is an active research area\n\n5. **Erdős Legacy:** Part of Erdős's program on consecutive integers and prime powers",
