Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er76d} conjectured that when $r\\geq 4$ there do not exist infinitely many such progressions of length $3$, and when $r=3$ there are infinitely many progressions of length $3$ but only finitely many of length $4$.\n\nBajpai, Bennett, and Chan \\cite{BBC24} proved that there are infinitely many four-term progressions of coprime powerful numbers, and infinitely many three-term progressions of coprime $3$-powerful numbers. They also show that there exist only finitely many three-term coprime progressions when $r\\geq 4$ assuming the ABC conjecture.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BBC24] Bajpai, Prajeet and Bennett, Michael A. and Chan, Tsz Ho, Arithmetic progressions in squarefull numbers.
