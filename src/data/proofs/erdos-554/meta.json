    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #554 (Erdős–Graham, 1981) conjectures that the multicolor Ramsey number of odd cycles grows negligibly compared to the triangle Ramsey number as the number of colors increases. This is open even for the pentagon C₅.",
    "problemStatement": "Let R(G; k) be the k-color Ramsey number of G. Show that lim_{k→∞} R(C_{2n+1}; k) / R(K₃; k) = 0 for any n ≥ 2.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define Ramsey numbers for graphs parametrized by size, state the conjecture as a ratio-limit condition, and axiomatize known bounds: exponential lower bound for R(K₃; k), upper bounds for odd cycle Ramsey numbers, and classical 2-color results.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The conjecture says odd cycles are 'much easier' than triangles in multicolor Ramsey theory",
      "Open even for the simplest case n = 2 (the pentagon C₅)",
      "R(K₃; k) grows at least exponentially in k",
      "R(C_{2n+1}; 2) = 4n + 1 for n ≥ 2 (Bondy–Erdős 1973)",
      "The ratio R(C_{2n+1}; k) / R(K₃; k) is conjectured to tend to 0"
