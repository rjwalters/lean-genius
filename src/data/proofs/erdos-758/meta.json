    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #758: Cochromatic Number**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős and Gimbel and concerns the cochromatic number of graphs.\n\n**Key History:**\n- **Erdős-Gimbel:** Established 4 ≤ z(12) ≤ 5 and 5 ≤ z(15) ≤ 6\n- **Gimbel [Gi86]:** Proved z(n) ~ n/log n asymptotically\n- **Bhavik Mehta:** Computationally verified z(12) = 4 by finding the unique extremal graph\n\n**Mathematical Context:**\nThe cochromatic number generalizes both chromatic number (independent sets only) and clique cover number (cliques only). It connects to Ramsey theory since R(3) = 6 and R(4) = 18 control the growth of z(n).",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nThe cochromatic number ζ(G) of a graph G is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that each color class induces either a complete graph (clique) or an empty graph (independent set).\n\nLet z(n) = max{ζ(G) : G is a graph on n vertices}.\n\n**Question:** Determine z(n) for small values. In particular, is z(12) = 4?\n\n**Answer: YES** - Bhavik Mehta proved computationally that z(12) = 4.\n\n**Known values for n = 1 to 19:**\n{1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6}\n\n**Open:** z(20) = 6 or 7?",

      "**Cochromatic Flexibility:** Each color class can be a clique OR independent set, making coloring easier than chromatic coloring",
      "**Ramsey Connection:** R(k,k) bounds how high z(n) can be, since large z requires both G and Ḡ to lack large cliques",
