How small can $a_{n+1}-a_n$ be? Is it possible that $a_{n+1}-a_n<n$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er98} writes that Graham 'recently proved' that there is such a sequence for which $a_{n+1}-a_n<n^{1+o(1)}$, and that Melfi proved a somewhat weaker result.\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er62c} proved that a sum-free set has density zero. Deshouillers, Erd\\H{o}s, and Melfi \\cite{DEM99} constructed a sum-free set that grows like $a_n\\sim n^{3+o(1)}$.\n\nLuczak and Schoen \\cite{LuSc00} have proved that, for all large $N$,\\[\\lvert A\\cap [1,N]\\rvert\\ll (N\\log N)^{1/2},\\]and that there exists a sum-free set $B$ such that\\[\\lvert B\\cap [1,N]\\rvert \\gg \\frac{N^{1/2}}{(\\log N)^{1/2+o(1)}}\\]for all large $N$.\n\nIn \\cite{Er75b} and \\cite{Er77c} Erd\\H{o}s asks to determine the maximum possible value of $\\sum_{n\\in A}\\frac{1}{n}$. Erd\\H{o}s had proved this is $<100$, and Sullivan had shown that this is $<4$, and Sullivan conjectured the maximum is slightly larger than $2$.\n\nSee also [790].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DEM99] Deshouillers, Jean-Marc and Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Melfi,\nGiuseppe, On a question about sum-free sequences.
