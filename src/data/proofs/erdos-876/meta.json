    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #876: Sum-Free Sets**\n\nThis problem concerns a special type of sum-free set where no element can be expressed as ANY sum of distinct smaller elements (not just pairs).\n\n**Key Historical Developments:**\n- **1962 (Erdős):** Proved sum-free sets have density zero\n- **1998 (Graham):** Showed gaps can be made < n^{1+o(1)}\n- **1999 (Deshouillers-Erdős-Melfi):** Constructed set with aₙ ~ n^{3+o(1)}\n- **2000 (Łuczak-Schoen):** Tight bounds on counting function\n- **Sullivan:** Improved reciprocal sum bound from 100 to 4\n\n**Related Problem:**\nSee Problem #790 for related questions about sum-free sequences.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Solved)**\n\nLet $A = \\{a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots\\} \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be an infinite sum-free set, meaning no $a \\in A$ equals $b_1 + b_2 + \\cdots + b_r$ for distinct $b_i \\in A$ with $b_i < a$.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. How small can the gaps $a_{n+1} - a_n$ be?\n2. Is it possible that $a_{n+1} - a_n < n$?\n\n**Known:**\n- Graham: Gaps can be < $n^{1+o(1)}$\n- Main question (linear gaps) is OPEN\n\n**Additional Question:**\nWhat is $\\max \\sum_{n \\in A} 1/n$? Sullivan shows < 4, conjectures ≈ 2.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Erdős Sum-Free:** Define IsSumFreeErdos forbidding any sum of distinct predecessors\n\n2. **Gap Functions:** Define gaps, gap bounds, and the main question\n\n3. **Graham's Result:** Axiomatize that gaps < n^{1+ε} are achievable\n\n4. **Density Results:** Axiomatize Erdős density zero and Łuczak-Schoen bounds\n\n5. **Growth Rate:** Axiomatize DEM construction with cubic growth\n\n6. **Reciprocal Sum:** Axiomatize Sullivan's bound and conjecture\n\n**Why Axioms?** The constructions are complex recursive procedures.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Erdős vs Classical Sum-Free:** The Erdős definition (no sum of ANY subset) is stronger than classical (no a + b = c).",
      "**Density Zero:** Sum-free sets are sparse - |A ∩ [1,N]| = O((N log N)^{1/2}).",
      "**Cubic Growth:** Elements grow like n^{3+o(1)} - much faster than square.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #876 asks how small gaps in infinite sum-free sets can be. Graham showed gaps < n^{1+o(1)} are achievable for any ε > 0, but whether gaps can be made < n (linear) remains OPEN. The counting function is Θ((N log N)^{1/2}) and the reciprocal sum is bounded between 2 and 4.",
    "implications": "**Implications in Additive Combinatorics**\n\n1. **Sum-Free Structure:** These sets reveal fundamental constraints on additive structure.\n\n2. **Density Barriers:** The (N log N)^{1/2} barrier is tight - neither side can be improved.\n\n3. **Growth Rate:** Cubic growth (n^3) is achievable, relating to subset sum constraints.\n\n4. **Reciprocal Sum:** The bounded reciprocal sum means elements must grow quickly.",
