    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #317, from [ErGr80, p.42], asks about the smallest nonzero value achievable by signed unit fraction sums. Kovac and van Doorn proved a weaker version of Question 1 with bound 2^{−n·(log log log n)^{1+o(1)}/log n}. Van Doorn's heuristics suggest this may be optimal, which would make Question 1 false.",
    "problemStatement": "Question 1: Is there c > 0 such that for every n ≥ 1, there exists δ_k ∈ {−1,0,1} with 0 < |∑δ_k/k| < c/2^n? Question 2: For large n, must |∑δ_k/k| > 1/lcm(1,...,n) when nonzero? Both OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines IsSignFunction, signedUnitFractionSum, signedSumAbs, lcm_1_to_n. Both questions are formal propositions. Known results include the weak inequality (axiom) and counterexample for small n (axiom). Kovac-van Doorn bound and heuristics are placeholders. A summary theorem states the problem status.",
