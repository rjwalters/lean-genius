    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #317, from [ErGr80, p.42], asks about the smallest nonzero value achievable by signed unit fraction sums. Given n, can we always find signs δ_k ∈ {-1, 0, 1} such that the sum ∑δ_k/k is positive but exponentially small?\n\nThe problem has two parts:\n1. Is there a universal constant c such that we can always achieve 0 < |sum| < c/2^n?\n2. For large n, must any nonzero sum exceed 1/lcm(1,...,n)?\n\nKovac and van Doorn proved a weaker version of Question 1 with bound 2^{-n·(log log log n)^{1+o(1)}/log n}. Van Doorn's heuristics suggest this may be optimal, which would make Question 1 false.",
