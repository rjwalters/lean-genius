  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #355 asks whether a lacunary sequence (where consecutive terms have ratio at least λ > 1) can have its finite reciprocal sums cover all rationals in some open interval.\n\nBleicher and Erdős originally conjectured the answer was NO [BlEr76, p.167]. They reasoned that sparse sequences like powers of 2 have reciprocal sums that form a discrete set (dyadic rationals), unable to fill any interval.\n\nThe problem was resolved in 2025 by van Doorn and Kovač, who proved that for any lacunarity constant λ ∈ (1, 2), there exist sequences whose reciprocal sums do cover all rationals in an interval. Crucially, λ = 2 is the sharp boundary: powers of 2 (λ = 2) cannot achieve this, but any λ < 2 suffices.\n\nThe proof constructs explicit sequences that balance being sparse enough to be lacunary while having enough 'overlap' between levels to achieve density in reciprocal sums.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there a **lacunary sequence** $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ (where $A = \\{a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots\\}$ and there exists $\\lambda > 1$ such that $a_{n+1}/a_n \\geq \\lambda$ for all $n$) such that\n$$\\left\\{ \\sum_{a \\in A'} \\frac{1}{a} : A' \\subseteq A \\text{ finite} \\right\\}$$\ncontains all rationals in some open interval?\n\n**Answer**: YES, for any $\\lambda \\in (1, 2)$, though not for $\\lambda = 2$.\n\n**Proof**: van Doorn and Kovač [DoKo25] constructed explicit lacunary sequences achieving this property.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining:\n\n1. **IsLacunaryWith**: A sequence is lacunary with parameter λ if a_{n+1}/a_n ≥ λ for all n\n2. **ReciprocalSums**: The set of all finite reciprocal sums from a sequence\n3. **RepresentsRationalsIn**: The property that all rationals in an interval are achievable\n\nThe main result (van Doorn-Kovač theorem) is stated as an axiom since its proof requires sophisticated constructions beyond current Mathlib.\n\nWe prove that powers of 2 form a lacunary sequence with λ = 2, illustrating the boundary case. For λ < 2, the van Doorn-Kovač theorem guarantees existence of suitable sequences.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Lacunary sequences**: Sequences where terms grow at least exponentially (a_{n+1}/a_n ≥ λ > 1). Powers of 2 are the canonical example with λ = 2.",
      "**The critical threshold λ = 2**: For λ = 2, reciprocal sums are dyadic rationals and cannot fill an interval. For λ < 2, there's enough 'overlap' to achieve density.",
      "**Egyptian fractions connection**: Finite sums of distinct unit fractions. The question asks when these can cover all rationals in an interval.",
      "**Disproving Bleicher-Erdős**: The 2025 result showed their NO conjecture was wrong for λ < 2, demonstrating the subtlety of the problem."
