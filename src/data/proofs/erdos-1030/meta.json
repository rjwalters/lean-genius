    "historicalContext": "**Ramsey Number Growth**\n\nRamsey numbers R(k, ℓ) measure the minimum graph size guaranteeing monochromatic cliques. The diagonal numbers R(k, k) grow exponentially, but their exact growth rate is unknown.\n\n**The Question**: Erdős and Sós asked whether the off-diagonal ratio R(k+1, k)/R(k, k) stays bounded away from 1. They couldn't even prove R(k+1, k) - R(k, k) > k^c for c > 1.\n\n**Trivial Bound**: R(k+1, k) - R(k, k) ≥ k - 2.\n\n**The Solution**: Burr-Erdős-Faudree-Schelp (1989) proved R(k+1, k) - R(k, k) ≥ 2k - 5, doubling the trivial bound asymptotically.",
