    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #921**\n\nThis problem, posed jointly by Erdős and Gallai, explores the fundamental tension between a graph's chromatic number and its odd cycle structure.\n\n**Key History:**\n- **Gallai (1963):** Initiated the study by proving f_4(n) ≫ n^{1/2}, constructing explicit 4-chromatic graphs with large odd girth\n- **Erdős (unpublished):** Proved the matching upper bound f_4(n) ≪ n^{1/2}, showing the k=4 case is completely characterized\n- **Kierstead-Szemerédi-Trotter (1984):** Resolved the full conjecture for all k ≥ 4, proving f_k(n) ≍ n^{1/(k-2)}\n\n**Mathematical Significance:**\nThe result quantifies a deep principle: high chromatic number forces short odd cycles. A bipartite graph (χ = 2) has no odd cycles at all. As chromatic number increases, some odd cycles must appear, and this problem determines exactly how short they must be.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Proved)**\n\nLet k ≥ 4 and let f_k(n) be the largest m such that there exists a graph on n vertices with chromatic number k in which every odd cycle has length > m.\n\n**Conjecture:** f_k(n) ≍ n^{1/(k-2)}\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nKierstead, Szemerédi, and Trotter (1984) proved that for all k ≥ 4:\n- Lower bound: f_k(n) ≥ c_k · n^{1/(k-2)} for some c_k > 0\n- Upper bound: f_k(n) ≤ C_k · n^{1/(k-2)} for some C_k > 0",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Definitions:** Define graph structure with adjacency, symmetry, and looplessness\n\n2. **Key Concepts:**\n   - Chromatic number χ(G): minimum k for proper k-coloring\n   - Odd girth: length of shortest odd cycle (or ∞ for bipartite)\n   - f(k,n): maximum odd girth - 1 among k-chromatic n-vertex graphs\n\n3. **Conjecture Formalization:** The Erdős-Gallai conjecture expressed as existence of constants c₁, c₂\n\n4. **Main Results:**\n   - Kierstead-Szemerédi-Trotter theorem (axiom): conjecture holds for all k ≥ 4\n   - Constructive k=4 case from Gallai and Erdős bounds\n\n5. **Why Axioms:** The proof requires deep results in extremal graph theory and regularity methods beyond current Mathlib scope",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Bipartite = No Odd Cycles:** A graph is 2-colorable iff it has no odd cycles, so χ ≥ 3 forces odd cycles",
      "**Exponent Formula:** For chromatic number k, the critical exponent is 1/(k-2): k=4 gives 1/2, k=5 gives 1/3, k=6 gives 1/4",
      "**The Trade-off:** High χ 'wants' dense structure with short cycles; large odd girth 'wants' no short odd cycles",
      "**Constructions vs Bounds:** Lower bounds use explicit probabilistic constructions; upper bounds use extremal counting arguments",
      "**Regularity Method:** Szemerédi's regularity lemma is key to the upper bound proof - Szemerédi was a coauthor!",
