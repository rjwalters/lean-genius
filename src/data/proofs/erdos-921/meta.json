  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "A question of Erdős and Gallai about the interplay between chromatic number and odd cycle structure. Gallai proved the lower bound for k = 4 in 1963, showing graphs can have chromatic number 4 with large odd girth. Erdős proved the matching upper bound (unpublished). The full conjecture for all k ≥ 4 was resolved by Kierstead, Szemerédi, and Trotter in 1984.",
    "problemStatement": "Let k ≥ 4 and let f_k(n) be the largest m such that there exists a graph on n vertices with chromatic number k in which every odd cycle has length > m. Is f_k(n) ≍ n^{1/(k-2)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the function f_k(n), states the asymptotic conjecture, and presents the Kierstead-Szemerédi-Trotter theorem. The k = 4 case is shown explicitly with Gallai's lower bound and Erdős's upper bound. The exponent 1/(k-2) captures the precise trade-off between chromatic number and odd girth.",
