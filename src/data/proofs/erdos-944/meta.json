Must there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ such that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>r$?\n\n\n\nA graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ in which every vertex is critical is called $k$-vertex-critical.\n\nThis was conjectured by Dirac in 1970 for $k\\geq 4$ and $r=1$. Dirac's conjecture was proved, for $k=5$, by Brown \\cite{Br92}. Lattanzio \\cite{La02} proved there exist such graphs for all $k$ such that $k-1$ is not prime. Independently, Jensen \\cite{Je02} gave an alternative construction for all $k\\geq 5$. The case $k=4$ and $r=1$ remains open.\n\nMartinsson and Steiner \\cite{MaSt25} proved this is true for every $r\\geq 1$ if $k$ is sufficiently large, depending on $r$. Skottova and Steiner \\cite{SkSt25} have improved this, proving that such graphs exist for all $k\\geq 5$ and $r\\geq 1$. The only remaining open case is $k=4$ (even the case $k=4$ and $r=1$ remains open).\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s also asked a stronger quantitative form of this question: let $f_k(n)$ denote the largest $r\\geq 1$ such that there exists a $k$-vertex-critical graph on $n$ vertices such that no set of at most $r$ edges is critical. He then asks whether $f_k(n)\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Skottova and Steiner \\cite{SkSt25} have proved this for $k\\geq 5$, establishing the bounds\\[n^{1/3}\\ll_k f_k(n) \\ll_k \\frac{n}{(\\log n)^C}\\]for all $k\\geq 5$, where $C>0$ is an absolute constant.\n\nThis is Problem 91 in the graph problems collection.
