    "historicalContext": "A **k-vertex-critical graph** is one with chromatic number k where every vertex is critical (its deletion reduces χ). A **critical edge** is one whose deletion reduces χ.\n\nDirac (1970) conjectured that for k ≥ 4, there exist k-vertex-critical graphs with NO critical edges. This asks whether vertex-criticality and edge-criticality can be 'decoupled.'\n\n**Timeline of results**:\n- 1970: Dirac's conjecture\n- 1992: Brown constructs a 5-vertex-critical graph with no critical edges (11 vertices)\n- 2002: Lattanzio shows such graphs exist when k-1 is not prime\n- 2002: Jensen gives a general construction for all k ≥ 5\n- 2025: Martinsson-Steiner prove existence for large k and any r ≥ 1\n- 2025: Skottova-Steiner show f_k(n) → ∞ for k ≥ 5\n\nThe case **k = 4 remains OPEN**.",
    "problemStatement": "A **critical vertex** is one whose deletion lowers the chromatic number. A **critical edge** (or critical edge set) is one whose deletion lowers the chromatic number.\n\n**Erdős Problem #944**: Let $k \\geq 4$ and $r \\geq 1$. Does there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ such that:\n1. Every vertex is critical (G is k-vertex-critical)\n2. Every critical set of edges has size $> r$?\n\n**Status by k**:\n- $k \\geq 5$: **SOLVED** (Jensen 2002)\n- $k = 4$: **OPEN** (even for $r = 1$)",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **k-vertex-critical**: A type class capturing graphs where χ(G) = k and every vertex is critical\n\n2. **Erdős944 property**: Extends k-vertex-critical with the condition that all critical edge sets have size > r\n\n3. **Main conjecture**: Existence for all k ≥ 4, r ≥ 1\n\n4. **Solved cases**: Brown (k=5), Lattanzio (k-1 not prime), Jensen (k≥5), Martinsson-Steiner (large k)\n\n5. **Open case**: k = 4 remains unsolved",

      "**Why complete graphs fail**: K_k is k-vertex-critical, but EVERY edge is critical. The problem asks if we can avoid edge-criticality.",
      "**Brown's construction (1992)**: The first example for k = 5 uses 11 vertices with a carefully chosen edge structure.",
      "**Why k = 4 is hard**: The constraints are very tight. A 4-vertex-critical graph must be quite dense (min degree 3), leaving little room for non-critical edges.",
      "**Quantitative version**: Erdős asked about f_k(n) = largest r for n-vertex k-critical graphs. Skottova-Steiner showed n^{1/3} ≪ f_k(n) ≪ n/(log n)^C for k ≥ 5.",
      "**Gap in understanding**: The jump from k = 4 to k = 5 represents a fundamental structural difference that remains unexplained."

The question of whether vertex-criticality and edge-criticality can be decoupled connects to fundamental questions about the 'redundancy' in graph colorings.
