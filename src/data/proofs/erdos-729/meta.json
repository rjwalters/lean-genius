Are there infinitely many integers $a,b,n$ with $a+b> n+C\\log n$ such that the denominator of\\[\\frac{n!}{a!b!}\\]contains only primes $\\ll_C 1$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er68c} proved that if $a!b!\\mid n!$ then $a+b\\leq n+O(\\log n)$. The proof is easy, and can be done with powers of $2$ alone: Legendre's formula implies that if $2^k$ is the highest power of $2$ dividing $n!$ then $k=n+O(\\log n)$, and hence if $a!b!\\mid n!$ then $a+b\\leq n+O(\\log n)$.\n\nThis problem is asking if $a!b!\\mid n!$ 'ignoring what happens on small primes' still implies $a+b\\leq n+O(\\log n)$.\n\nSee also [728], and [401] for a later problem in a similar spirit.\n\nThis has been proved in the affirmative by Barreto and Leeham, using ChatGPT and Aristotle, with a modification of the argument used for [728].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er68c] P.
