    "problemStatement": "Prove that\\[R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1\\]for $k\\geq n\\geq 3$ (except when $n=k=3$). Asked by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp, who also ask for the smallest value of $k$ such that this identity holds (for fixed $n$). They also ask, for fixed $n$, what is the minimum value of $R(C_k,K_n)$? This identity was proved for $k>n^2-2$ by Bondy and Erdős [BoEr73]. Nikiforov [Ni05] extended this to $k\\geq 4n+2$. Keevash, Long, and Skokan [KLS21] have proved this identity when $k\\geq C\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}$ for some constant $C$, thus establishing the conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. This problem is #18 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection. View the LaTeX source",
