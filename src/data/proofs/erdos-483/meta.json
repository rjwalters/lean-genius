  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Schur (1916) proved that for every k, any k-coloring of {1,...,N} must contain a monochromatic solution to a+b=c if N is large enough. The Schur number f(k) is this threshold. The question of whether f(k) grows at most exponentially connects to Ramsey theory and additive combinatorics.",
    "problemStatement": "Is f(k) < c^k for some constant c > 0? That is, are the Schur numbers bounded by a simple exponential in the number of colors?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize the Schur number, record exact values for k ≤ 5, state the exponential lower bound and factorial upper bound, and formalize the conjecture that f(k) is at most exponential.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The known values f(1)=2, f(2)=5, f(3)=14, f(4)=45, f(5)=161 grow rapidly but sub-factorially",
      "The lower bound 380^{k/5} shows f(k) is at least exponential",
      "The upper bound ≈ e·k! leaves a huge gap: exponential vs factorial",

      "Schur numbers are closely related to Ramsey numbers R(3,...,3) with k arguments"
