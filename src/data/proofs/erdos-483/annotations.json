    "significance": "The Schur number is the central object. Axiomatization avoids the need for a constructive minimum, while HasMonochromaticSum captures the combinatorial condition."

    "significance": "The growth rate f(1), f(2), ..., f(5) is roughly 2, 5, 14, 45, 161 — each roughly 3× the previous, suggesting exponential growth around 3^k."

    "content": "Erdős asked whether f(k) < c^k for some constant c. This would mean Schur numbers grow at most exponentially, matching the exponential lower bound up to the base.",
    "significance": "If true, Schur numbers would be Θ(c^k) for some c, giving a complete asymptotic picture. This connects to similar questions for Ramsey numbers."
