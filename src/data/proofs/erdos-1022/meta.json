    "historicalContext": "**Property B and Hypergraph Coloring**\n\nProperty B (named after Bernstein) asks when a family of sets can be 2-colored so that no set is monochromatic. This is equivalent to hypergraph 2-colorability.\n\n**The Sparseness Condition**: For every set X, count how many family members are subsets of X. If this count is < c_t|X| for all X, the family is 'sparse'.\n\n**Lovász's Result (1968)**: Erdős originally conjectured c_2 = 1 for the t = 2 case, which Lovász proved.\n\n**The Open Question**: Does c_t → ∞ as t → ∞? That is, do larger minimum set sizes allow sparser families to still have property B?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIs there a constant c_t (with c_t → ∞ as t → ∞) such that:\n- If F is a finite family of finite sets, all of size ≥ t, and\n- For every set X, fewer than c_t|X| members of F are subsets of X,\n- Then F has property B (chromatic number 2)?\n\n**Status**: OPEN\n\n**Known**: c_2 = 1 (Lovász 1968)",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approaches to the Problem**\n\n1. **Probabilistic Method**: Random 2-colorings succeed if expected monochromatic sets < 1.\n\n2. **Lovász Local Lemma**: Handles dependencies between sets in the family.\n\n3. **Cover-Free Families**: Connection to families where no set is covered by few others.\n\n4. **Density Arguments**: Sparseness bounds the local density of the family.\n\n**Challenge**: The condition involves ALL possible supersets X, not just sets in F.",
