  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham studied n_k, the smallest n > 2k such that the descending product (n-1)⋯(n-k) avoids all primes in (k,2k). They proved n_k > k^{1+c} and conjectured superpolynomial growth. Adenwalla gave the upper bound n_k ≤ ∏_{k<p<2k} p = e^{O(k)}. The exact growth rate remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Estimate n_k. Is n_k > k^d for every d? Is n_k < e^{o(k)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the descending product, Bertrand-range primes, and the avoidance condition. n_k is axiomatised with minimality. Known lower and upper bounds are stated, along with both conjectures.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "By Bertrand's postulate, primes in (k,2k) always exist, so avoidance is non-trivial",
      "Erdős–Graham: n_k > k^{1+c} for some c > 0",
      "Adenwalla: n_k ≤ ∏_{k<p<2k} p = e^{O(k)} (product of Bertrand primes)",
