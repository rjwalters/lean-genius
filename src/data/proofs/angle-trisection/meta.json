  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The problem of trisecting an arbitrary angle using only compass and straightedge is one of the three famous classical Greek problems, along with doubling the cube and squaring the circle. For over 2000 years, mathematicians attempted to solve these problems without success.\n\nThe impossibility was not proven until the 19th century. Pierre Wantzel published his proof in 1837, showing that angle trisection and doubling the cube are impossible. His key insight was to translate the geometric problem into algebra: compass and straightedge constructions correspond to field extensions of degree 2, so constructible numbers have degree 2^n over the rationals.\n\nThe squaring of the circle was proven impossible by Lindemann in 1882, when he showed that π is transcendental (not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients).",
    "problemStatement": "Given an arbitrary angle θ, can it be divided into three equal parts using only a compass and unmarked straightedge?\n\nThe answer is NO for a general angle. In particular, a 60° angle cannot be trisected.\n\nTo trisect 60°, we would need to construct a 20° angle, which is equivalent to constructing the number cos(20°). Using the triple angle formula:\n$$\\cos(60°) = 4\\cos^3(20°) - 3\\cos(20°)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = 4x^3 - 3x$$\n$$8x^3 - 6x - 1 = 0$$\n\nSo cos(20°) satisfies an irreducible cubic polynomial over ℚ.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof proceeds in several stages:\n\n1. **Algebraic Translation**: Show that trisecting 60° requires constructing cos(20°).\n\n2. **Find the Minimal Polynomial**: Use the triple angle formula to derive that cos(20°) satisfies 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0.\n\n3. **Prove Irreducibility**: By the rational root theorem, check that ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8 are not roots. For cubics, no rational roots means irreducible over ℚ.\n\n4. **Degree Argument**: Since the polynomial is irreducible of degree 3, we have [ℚ(cos 20°) : ℚ] = 3.\n\n5. **Constructibility Criterion**: Wantzel's theorem: constructible numbers have degree 2^n over ℚ.\n\n6. **Contradiction**: 3 is not a power of 2, so cos(20°) is not constructible.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "This formalization demonstrates one of the great achievements of 19th century mathematics: the translation of geometric construction problems into field theory. Wantzel's insight that constructibility corresponds to degree 2^n extensions over ℚ definitively settled problems that had resisted solution for two millennia.\n\nThe proof reveals why degree 3 polynomials create the obstruction: the equation 8x³ - 6x - 1 = 0 for cos(20°) is irreducible over ℚ, giving degree 3, which is not a power of 2.",
    "implications": "The algebraic characterization of constructibility has far-reaching consequences:\n\n1. **Wantzel's Complete Characterization**: An angle θ can be trisected iff cos(θ) is a root of a polynomial whose degree is a power of 2.\n\n2. **Regular Polygons**: A regular n-gon is constructible iff n = 2^k · p₁ · p₂ · ... · pₘ where the pᵢ are distinct Fermat primes (3, 5, 17, 257, 65537).\n\n3. **Connection to Galois Theory**: The same ideas connect to Abel-Ruffini's theorem on the unsolvability of the quintic.\n\n4. **Alternative Constructions**: While compass-and-straightedge fails, angle trisection IS possible with:\n   - A marked ruler (neusis construction)\n   - Origami (paper folding)\n   - Certain curves (trisectrix, conchoid)\n\n5. **Modern Mathematics**: This problem launched the systematic study of field extensions and laid groundwork for abstract algebra.",
