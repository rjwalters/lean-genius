    "problemStatement": "Let $A\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ be an infinite set such that the triple sums $a+b+c$ are all distinct for $a,b,c\\in A$ (aside from the trivial coincidences). Is it true that\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/3}}=0?\\] Erdős proved that if the pairwise sums $a+b$ are all distinct aside from the trivial coincidences then\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/2}}=0.\\]This is discussed in problem C11 of Guy's collection [Gu04], in which Guy says Erdős offered \\$500 for the general problem of whether, for all $h\\geq 2$,\\[\\liminf \\frac{\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert}{N^{1/h}}=0\\]whenever the sum of $h$ terms in $A$ are distinct. This was proved for $h=4$ by Nash [Na89] and for all even $h$ by Chen [Ch96b]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 30 September 2025.",
