  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1976, asking about the smoothness threshold for blocks of consecutive integers. The problem connects to the distribution of smooth numbers and prime gaps. The breakthrough of Ford, Green, Konyagin, Maynard, and Tao (2018) on large prime gaps yields the best known upper bound.",
    "problemStatement": "Let S(k) be the minimal x such that n+1,...,n+k are all x-smooth for a positive density set of n. Is S(k) ≥ k^{1−o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize x-smoothness, smooth blocks, the threshold function S(k), the main conjecture, and known upper/lower bounds including the FGKMT result.",
