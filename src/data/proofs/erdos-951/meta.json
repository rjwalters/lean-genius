  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #951**\n\nThis problem concerns Beurling generalized prime numbers, introduced by Arne Beurling in 1937. A Beurling prime sequence is a sequence 1 < a₁ < a₂ < ... of real numbers whose products behave like integers.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Beurling (1937): Introduced generalized primes and proved the prime number theorem extends to them under certain conditions\n- Erdős: Posed this problem during a lecture at Queens College, possibly suggested by S. Shapiro\n- The problem asks if the ordinary primes are the 'densest' sequence satisfying the well-separation property\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nA Beurling prime sequence must satisfy: for any two distinct products ∏aᵢ^{kᵢ} and ∏aⱼ^{ℓⱼ}, their difference is at least 1. This mimics how products of ordinary primes (i.e., positive integers) are always at least 1 apart.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nLet 1 < a₁ < a₂ < ... be a sequence of real numbers such that for every distinct pair of non-negative finitely supported integer tuples (kᵢ), (ℓⱼ):\n\n|∏ᵢ aᵢ^{kᵢ} - ∏ⱼ aⱼ^{ℓⱼ}| ≥ 1\n\n**Question:** Is it true that #{aᵢ ≤ x} ≤ π(x)?\n\nIn other words, can any Beurling prime sequence be denser than the actual primes?",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Beurling Prime Definition:**\n   - Define WellSeparatedProducts predicate using Finsupp for exponent tuples\n   - Define BeurlingPrimes structure with strictly increasing, all >1, and well-separated conditions\n\n2. **Counting Functions:**\n   - beurlingPi: count Beurling primes up to x\n   - primePi: standard prime counting function\n\n3. **The Conjecture:**\n   - erdos951_conjecture: for all Beurling sequences, π_a(x) ≤ π(x)\n\n4. **Examples:**\n   - Ordinary primes form a Beurling sequence (by FTA)\n   - Powers of 2 form a sparser Beurling sequence\n\n5. **Related Results:**\n   - Beurling's Conjecture: if the Beurling integers have density x + o(log x), then the sequence must be the actual primes",

      "**The Separation Condition:** |∏aᵢ^{kᵢ} - ∏aⱼ^{ℓⱼ}| ≥ 1 ensures 'Beurling integers' (products) don't cluster densely",
