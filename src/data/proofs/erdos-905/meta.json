  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Bollobás and Erdős conjectured this result about edge-triangle multiplicity. It was independently proved by Edwards (unpublished) and Hadziivanov-Nikiforov in 1979. The problem connects to Turán's classical theorem on triangle-free graphs.",
    "problemStatement": "Every graph with n vertices and more than n²/4 edges contains an edge which is in at least n/6 triangles.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines a custom Graph structure with symmetric, irreflexive edge sets. It introduces IsTriangle, triangleCountEdge, and maxTriangleMultiplicity. The Turán threshold n²/4 is defined, and the main Bollobás-Erdős conjecture is axiomatized as proved. Tightness of the constant n/6 and connections to Turán theory are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "n²/4 is the Turán threshold for triangle-free graphs",
      "Exceeding this threshold forces high triangle multiplicity on some edge",
      "The constant n/6 is tight — cannot be improved",
      "The Turán graph T(n,2) achieves the threshold with no triangles",
      "Connects to Problem #80 (general case) and #1034 (stronger version)"
