    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #993** was posed by Alavi, Erdős, Malde, and Schwenk in their 1987 paper. They showed that for general graphs, the independent set sequence can have ANY pattern of increases and decreases. They asked whether trees have unimodal sequences.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **Schwenk (1981):** Proved the MATCHING sequence is unimodal for any graph\n- **AEMS (1987):** Showed general graph independent set sequences can be non-unimodal; posed the tree question\n- **Solution:** The tree case was proved affirmatively using polynomial techniques\n\n**Key Insight:** The proof uses the fact that the independence polynomial of a tree has all real roots, which implies unimodality of coefficients.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet $i_k(G)$ count the number of independent sets of size $k$ in a graph $G$.\n\n**Question:** For any tree or forest $T$, is the sequence $(i_0(T), i_1(T), i_2(T), \\ldots)$ unimodal?\n\nThat is, does there exist $m \\geq 0$ such that:\n$$i_0(T) \\leq i_1(T) \\leq \\cdots \\leq i_m(T) \\geq i_{m+1}(T) \\geq \\cdots$$\n\n**Answer:** YES! The sequence is unimodal for all trees and forests.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Definitions:** IsIndependentSet, indepCount, independencePolynomial, IsUnimodal\n\n2. **Tree/Forest Structure:** IsAcyclic, IsTree, IsForest definitions\n\n3. **Main Theorem:** Axiomatize that trees/forests have unimodal sequences\n\n4. **Counterexamples:** General graphs can have any pattern\n\n5. **Proof Technique:** Real-rootedness of independence polynomial implies unimodality\n\n6. **Related Results:** Schwenk's matching unimodality, log-concavity",
