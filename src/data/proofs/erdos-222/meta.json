Explore the behaviour of (i.e. find good upper and lower bounds for) the consecutive differences $n_{k+1}-n_k$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er51} proved that, for infinitely many $k$,\\[ n_{k+1}-n_k \\gg \\frac{\\log n_k}{\\sqrt{\\log\\log n_k}}.\\]Richards \\cite{Ri82} improved this to\\[\\limsup_{k\\to \\infty} \\frac{n_{k+1}-n_k}{\\log n_k} \\geq 1/4.\\]The constant $1/4$ here has been improved, most lately to $0.868\\cdots$ by Dietmann, Elsholtz, Kalmynin, Konyagin, and Maynard \\cite{DEKKM22}.\n\nThe best known upper bound is due to Bambah and Chowla \\cite{BaCh47}, who proved that\\[n_{k+1}-n_k \\ll n_k^{1/4}.\\]The differences are listed at A256435 on the OEIS.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BaCh47] Bambah, R.
