  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether a constant fraction of minimum degree suffices to embed the n-dimensional hypercube in a graph on 2^n vertices. This connects extremal graph theory with hypercube structure. If false, alternative formulations seek the smallest host graph or the precise minimum degree threshold.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there c > 0 such that every graph on 2^n vertices with minimum degree > (1-c)·2^n contains Q_n as a subgraph?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define hypercubeGraph via XOR adjacency on Fin(2^n), HasMinDegree for degree conditions, and ContainsAsSubgraph for injective homomorphisms. The main conjecture and two alternative formulations are stated as Prop. The hypercube construction proves symmetry and irreflexivity.",
