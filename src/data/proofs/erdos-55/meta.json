Prove any non-trivial bounds about the growth rate of such an $A$ for $r>2$.\n\n\n\nA paper of Burr and Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{BuEr85} proves both upper and lower bounds for $r=2$, showing that there exists some $c>0$ such that it cannot be true that\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\leq c(\\log N)^2\\]for all large $N$, and also constructing a Ramsey $2$-complete $A$ such that for all large $N$\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\ll (\\log N)^3.\\]Burr has shown that the sequence of $k$th powers is Ramsey $r$-complete for every $r,k\\geq 1$.\n\nSolved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham \\cite{CFP21}, who constructed for every $r\\geq 2$ an $r$-Ramsey complete $A$ such that for all large $N$\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\ll r(\\log N)^2,\\]and showed that this is best possible, in that there exists some constant $c>0$ such that if $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ satisfies\\[\\lvert A\\cap \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}\\rvert \\leq cr(\\log N)^2\\]for all large $N$ then $A$ cannot be $r$-Ramsey complete.\n\nSee also [54] and [843].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BuEr85] Burr, S.
