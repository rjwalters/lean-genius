  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects Ramsey theory with additive number theory. Burr and Erdős (1985) established initial bounds for r=2, leaving a gap between (log N)² and (log N)³. The problem asked for non-trivial bounds for r > 2. Conlon, Fox, and Pham (2021) completely resolved the problem, showing the optimal growth is Θ(r(log N)²).",
    "problemStatement": "A set of integers A is Ramsey r-complete if, whenever A is r-coloured, all sufficiently large integers can be written as a monochromatic sum of elements of A. Prove any non-trivial bounds about the growth rate of such an A for r > 2.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines Ramsey r-completeness via colorings and monochromatic subsets. The main results (Burr-Erdős bounds, Conlon-Fox-Pham solution) are stated as axioms. Two theorems are proved from these axioms: the complete characterization and the special case r=2.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Ramsey r-complete sets must have growth at least cr(log N)² for some universal c > 0",
      "Growth rate r(log N)² is achievable for all r ≥ 2 (constructive)",
      "For r=2, the optimal growth is Θ((log N)²), closing the Burr-Erdős gap",
      "The k-th powers are Ramsey r-complete for all r,k ≥ 1 (Burr)",
      "The linear dependence on r in the growth rate is optimal"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #55 on Ramsey r-complete sets. The problem is SOLVED: the optimal growth rate for r-Ramsey complete sets is Θ(r(log N)²). This was proved by Conlon, Fox, and Pham in 2021, resolving the problem for all r ≥ 2.",
