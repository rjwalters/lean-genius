  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from Salem and Zygmund's work on random polynomials and appears in Erdős's 1961 compilation [Er61, p.253]. It asks about the typical behavior of the maximum of a polynomial on [-1,1] whose coefficients are random ±1 signs determined by the binary expansion of a uniformly random real number t ∈ (0,1).",
    "problemStatement": "Determine the correct order of magnitude of M_n(t) = max_{x∈[-1,1]} |Σ_{k≤n} (-1)^{ε_k(t)} x^k| for almost all t ∈ (0,1), where ε_k(t) ∈ {0,1} are the binary digits of t.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define the binary digit function, random sign polynomial, and maximum modulus M_n(t). We state Erdős's lower bound (n^{1/2-ε} is negligible compared to M_n), Chung's upper bound (√(n/log log n) infinitely often), and the Salem–Zygmund comparison for trigonometric polynomials.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Signs are determined by binary digits of t, making this equivalent to random ±1 coefficients under Lebesgue measure",
      "Erdős proved M_n(t) ≫ n^{1/2-ε} a.e., so the growth is at least almost √n",
      "Chung showed M_n(t) ≪ √(n/log log n) for infinitely many n, but this is not a uniform upper bound",
      "The classical Salem–Zygmund theorem gives Θ(√(n log n)) for trigonometric polynomials on [0,2π]",
      "The polynomial case differs because x^k concentrates near x = ±1"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #524 asks for the precise order of magnitude of the maximum of random ±1 polynomials on [-1,1]. The known bounds leave a substantial gap between n^{1/2-ε} from below and √(n/log log n) from above (infinitely often).",
    "implications": "Resolution would advance the theory of random polynomials, connecting to the Littlewood–Offord problem, flat polynomials, and the distribution of zeros of random analytic functions.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is M_n(t) = Θ(√n) for a.e. t?",
      "Does a uniform upper bound M_n(t) ≤ C·f(n) hold for all large n, a.e.?",
      "What is the distribution of M_n(t) for fixed large n?",
      "Can the gap between Erdős's lower and Chung's upper bound be closed?"
