  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #711 consists of two parts. The first (max_m f(n,m) ≤ n^{1+o(1)}) remains OPEN, though the weaker bound n^{3/2} is known. The second part (max_m(f(n,m)-f(n,n)) → ∞) was SOLVED by van Doorn in 2026, who proved the stronger bound f(n,m)-f(n,n) ≫ n·(log n/log log n) for some m.",
    "implications": "**Number-Theoretic Significance**\n\n1. **Starting Point Matters:** The interval's starting position significantly affects the minimum length needed\n\n2. **Residue Class Effects:** The distribution of multiples depends on m mod k for each k\n\n3. **Connection to #710:** Understanding f(n,m) helps understand the special case f(n,n)\n\n4. **van Doorn's Contribution:** First proof that the dependence on m can be substantial\n\n5. **Open Problem:** The n^{1+o(1)} bound would be a major improvement",
