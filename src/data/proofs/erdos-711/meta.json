    "problemStatement": "Forum\nFavourites\nTags\nMore\n Go\n Go\nDual View\nRandom Solved\nRandom Open\n\nLet $f(n,m)$ be minimal such that in $(m,m+f(n,m))$ there exist distinct integers $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$ such that $k\\mid a_k$ for all $1\\leq k\\leq n$. Prove that\\[\\max_m f(n,m) \\leq n^{1+o(1)}\\]and that\\[\\max_m (f(n,m)-f(n,n))\\to \\infty.\\]\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Pomerance \\cite{ErPo80}, who proved that\\[\\max_m f(n,m) \\ll n^{3/2}\\]and\\[n\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right)^{1/2} \\ll f(n,n)\\ll n(\\log n)^{1/2}.\\]In \\cite{Er92c} Erd\\H{o}s offered 1000 rupees for a proof of either; for uniform comparison across prizes I have converted this using the 1992 exchange rates.\n\nvan Doorn \\cite{vD26} has provided an affirmative answer to the second question, proving that, for all large $n$, there exists $m=m(n)$ such that\\[f(n,m)-f(n,n) \\gg \\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}n.\\]See also [710].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er92c] Erd\\\"{o}s, P., Some of my forgotten problems in number theory.
