    "historicalContext": "**Steiner Triple Systems and High Girth**\n\nA Steiner triple system (STS) of order n is a collection of 3-element subsets (triples) of an n-set such that every pair of elements appears in exactly one triple. These fundamental combinatorial structures were first studied by Kirkman in 1847, who proved they exist if and only if n ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 6).\n\n**The Girth Question**\n\nErdős asked in 1976 whether STS with arbitrarily high girth exist. The girth condition requires that any j edges (2 ≤ j ≤ g) span at least j+3 vertices, preventing \"tight\" configurations where edges overlap heavily.\n\n**The Resolution (2022)**\n\nKwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin resolved this in 2022 using a sophisticated random greedy construction. Their proof employs the Rödl nibble method and introduces a \"spread measure\" to control the girth property during construction.\n\n**Special Case: Pasch-Free STS**\n\nThe girth-3 case corresponds to avoiding the Pasch configuration (4 triples on 6 vertices). Anti-Pasch STS were known to exist before KSSS's general result.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nFor any $g \\geq 2$, if $n$ is sufficiently large and $n \\equiv 1, 3 \\pmod{6}$, does there exist a 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that:\n1. Every pair of vertices is contained in exactly one edge (Steiner triple system)\n2. For any $2 \\leq j \\leq g$, any collection of $j$ edges contains at least $j+3$ vertices\n\n**Answer: YES**\n\nKwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin (2022) proved that high-girth Steiner triple systems exist for all admissible orders.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Hypergraphs:** Define Hypergraph3 structure for 3-uniform hypergraphs.\n\n2. **STS Property:** Formalize IsSteinerTripleSystem requiring each pair in exactly one edge.\n\n3. **Girth:** Define HasGirthAtLeast requiring j edges span ≥ j+3 vertices.\n\n4. **Admissibility:** Define IsAdmissible for n ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6).\n\n5. **Main Result:** Axiomatize Kirkman's theorem and KSSS theorem.\n\n6. **Special Cases:** Define Pasch configurations and anti-Pasch STS.\n\n7. **Related:** Include resolvable STS and Kirkman schoolgirl problem.\n\n**Why Axiomatization?** The KSSS proof is highly technical, using probabilistic combinatorics (Rödl nibble, concentration inequalities) far beyond Mathlib.",

      "**Kirkman's Condition:** STS(n) exists iff n ≡ 1, 3 (mod 6). This is necessary for the girth question to make sense.",
      "**Why j+3?:** Two edges share at most 1 vertex in an STS, so 2 edges span ≥ 5 = 2+3 vertices. The condition generalizes this.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #207 asked whether high-girth Steiner triple systems exist for all admissible orders. Kwan, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin (2022) proved YES using a random greedy construction with spread measure analysis.

    "implications": "**Implications in Design Theory**\n\n1. **Arbitrary Girth:** Any forbidden configuration can be avoided in large STS.\n\n2. **Random Methods Work:** Even for highly structured objects like STS, probabilistic constructions succeed.\n\n3. **Spread Measure Technique:** A new tool applicable to other design construction problems.\n\n4. **Hypergraph Regularity:** Connects to Szemerédi-type regularity for hypergraphs.\n\n5. **Coding Theory:** High-girth STS relate to error-correcting codes with specific distance properties.",
