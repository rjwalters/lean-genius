    "problemStatement": "Let $A\\subset\\mathbb{N}$ be infinite. Must there exist some $k\\geq 1$ such that almost all integers have a divisor of the form $a+k$ for some $a\\in A$? Asked by Erdős and Tenenbaum. Ruzsa gave the following simple counterexample: let $A=\\{n_10$ there is some $k=k(\\epsilon)$ such that at least $1-\\epsilon$ density of all integers have a divisor of the form $a+k$ for some $a\\in A$.
