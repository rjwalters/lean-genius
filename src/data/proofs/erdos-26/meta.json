  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #26 was posed by Erdős and Tenenbaum and concerns the relationship between \"thick\" sequences (those with divergent reciprocal sums) and \"Behrend\" sequences (those whose multiples cover almost all integers).\n\nThe Davenport-Erdős theorem (1951) established that every Behrend sequence must be thick, but the converse was unknown: if A is thick, must some shift A+k be Behrend?\n\nRuzsa provided the first counterexample using a clever construction involving prime residues. His sequence was not thick, so Van Doorn later modified the construction to produce a thick counterexample, definitively disproving the conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $A \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be infinite with $\\sum_{a \\in A} \\frac{1}{a} = \\infty$ (a \"thick\" sequence). Must there exist some $k \\geq 1$ such that almost all integers have a divisor of the form $a + k$ for some $a \\in A$?\n\n**Answer: NO** — Van Doorn constructed a thick sequence where no shift achieves density 1 coverage.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization takes an axiomatic approach:\n\n1. **Define key concepts**: Thick sequences (divergent reciprocal sums), Behrend sequences (density 1 multiples), and weakly Behrend (density ≥ 1-ε)\n\n2. **Axiomatize results**: The Davenport-Erdős theorem (Behrend ⇒ thick), Ruzsa's counterexample (non-thick, no Behrend shift), and Van Doorn's modification (thick, no Behrend shift)\n\n3. **Derive disproof**: From Van Doorn's counterexample, we show ¬Erdos26Conjecture by exhibiting a thick sequence with no Behrend shift",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Thick sequences**: A sequence A is thick if Σ(1/a) = ∞. This is a measure of how \"dense\" the sequence is — thicker sequences have more elements per interval.",
      "**Behrend sequences**: A sequence is Behrend if almost all integers are multiples of some element. The set of multiples has natural density 1.",
      "**The gap**: Davenport-Erdős showed Behrend ⇒ thick, but the converse fails. Thickness is necessary but not sufficient for density 1 coverage.",
      "**Ruzsa's construction**: Uses n_l ≡ -(k-1) (mod p_k) for primes p_k, ensuring each shift avoids some prime's multiples.",
      "**Open variant**: Tenenbaum's weaker question (density ≥ 1-ε for any ε > 0) remains open."
