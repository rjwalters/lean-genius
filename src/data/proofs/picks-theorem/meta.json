  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Pick published this theorem in 1899, but it remained obscure until popularized by Steinhaus in the 1960s. It provides an elegant way to compute areas by simply counting lattice points, connecting continuous geometry to discrete counting.",

    "proofStrategy": "Prove for triangles first using the fact that any lattice triangle has area (base * height)/2 expressed in lattice terms. Then use additivity: when triangulating a polygon, interior edges contribute zero net lattice points.",
