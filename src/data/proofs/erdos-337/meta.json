  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the relationship between an additive basis and its sumset. Erdős asked whether sparse additive bases must have sumsets that grow faster than the original set. Turjányi (1984) provided a surprising counterexample, showing the answer is NO. Ruzsa and Turjányi (1985) generalized this to h-fold sumsets and proved a related positive result for scaled intervals.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED: NO)**\n\nLet A ⊆ ℕ be an additive basis of any finite order with |A ∩ [1,N]| = o(N).\n\n**Question:** Is it true that\n|A+A ∩ [1,N]| / |A ∩ [1,N]| → ∞?\n\n**Answer:** NO (Turjányi 1984)\n\n**Related:**\n- Generalization to hA also fails (Ruzsa-Turjányi)\n- But |A+A+A ∩ [1,3N]| / |A ∩ [1,N]| → ∞ IS true\n- Open: Does |A+A ∩ [1,2N]| / |A ∩ [1,N]| → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines additive bases, sparse sets, and sumsets. Turjányi's counterexample is axiomatized as a witness showing the conjecture is false. The proof that the conjecture is false follows by contradiction: the counterexample has bounded ratio, contradicting the claimed unbounded growth. Ruzsa-Turjányi's generalization and positive result are also formalized.",

      "**Turjányi (1984):** Counterexample shows ratio can be bounded",
      "**Ruzsa-Turjányi:** Extended to hA for any h ≥ 2",
      "**Positive Result:** |A+A+A ∩ [1,3N]| / |A ∩ [1,N]| → ∞ IS true",
