The referee of the paper also gave the example of $\\lvert z(z^5-1)\\rvert<5.6^{-6/5}$ (depicted {IMAGE=1047Ref,here}).\n\nGoodman raises the question of the maximum number of non-convex components that are possible as a function of the degree of $f$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHP58] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Herzog, F. and Piranian, G., Metric properties of polynomials.
