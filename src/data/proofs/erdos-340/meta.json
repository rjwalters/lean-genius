  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Mian–Chowla sequence was introduced independently by Mian (1944) and Chowla (1944). Erdős and Graham asked about its growth rate in 1980. The sequence is a natural test case for the efficiency of greedy algorithms in additive combinatorics. OEIS A005282.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be the greedy Sidon sequence starting from 1. Is |A ∩ [1,N]| ≫ N^{1/2-ε} for all ε > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the Sidon set definition, the greedy construction, initial values, known bounds (N^{1/3} lower, √N upper), and the main conjecture on near-optimal growth.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Any Sidon set in [1,N] has at most ~√N elements, so N^{1/2} is the natural target",
      "The greedy construction gives at least Ω(N^{1/3}), leaving a large gap",
      "The conjecture says greedy is nearly optimal: N^{1/2-ε} for any ε > 0",
      "The difference set A-A may have positive density — a separate open question",
      "Related to Problem #156 on the slow growth of maximal Sidon subsets"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #340 asks whether the greedy Sidon (Mian–Chowla) sequence grows at nearly the optimal rate N^{1/2}. The known lower bound N^{1/3} is far from the conjectured N^{1/2-ε}. The difference set density question is also open.",
    "implications": "A proof would demonstrate that greedy algorithms achieve near-optimal density for Sidon sets, a fundamental question in additive combinatorics with connections to coding theory and pseudorandom constructions.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is |A ∩ [1,N]| ≫ N^{1/2-ε} for all ε > 0?",
      "What is the exact growth rate: N^{1/2} or something smaller?",
