    "historicalContext": "Euler discovered this formula in 1758 while studying polyhedra. The formula V - E + F = 2 is one of the most beautiful results in mathematics, connecting three seemingly unrelated counts with a simple constant.\n\nCauchy provided the first rigorous proof in 1813. The result generalizes to the Euler characteristic chi = 2 - 2g for surfaces of genus g.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euler, 1758)**: For any convex polyhedron with V vertices, E edges, and F faces:\n\n$$V - E + F = 2$$\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #13 and represents a fundamental topological invariant.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof by Edge Reduction**:\n\n1. **Base Case**: The tetrahedron has V=4, E=6, F=4, so 4 - 6 + 4 = 2\n2. **Inductive Step**: For any polyhedron with E > 6 edges:\n   - Remove an edge (merges two faces): decreases E and F by 1\n   - Contract an edge (merges two vertices): decreases V and E by 1\n3. Both operations preserve V - E + F\n4. By reduction to tetrahedron, all polyhedra have V - E + F = 2",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant - it depends only on the surface type",
      "All convex polyhedra are homeomorphic to a sphere, which has chi = 2",
