    "historicalContext": "The Basel Problem, named after the hometown of the Bernoulli family, was posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and remained unsolved for nearly a century. The problem asked: what is the exact value of ∑ 1/n²?\n\nLeonhard Euler solved it in 1734 at age 27, proving the surprising result that the sum equals π²/6. This unexpected appearance of π in a problem about integers made Euler famous throughout Europe.\n\nEuler's original proof used a daring manipulation of sin(x)/x as an infinite product, which was not fully rigorous by modern standards. The result was later proved rigorously using Fourier analysis and complex methods.\n\nThe Basel identity is now known to be ζ(2) = π²/6, where ζ is the Riemann zeta function. This connects to deep mathematics including the distribution of prime numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Euler, 1734)**: The sum of reciprocals of perfect squares equals π²/6:\n\n$$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} + \\frac{1}{2^2} + \\frac{1}{3^2} + \\cdots = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #14 and represents one of the most beautiful identities in mathematics.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Modern Approach (Mathlib)**:\n\nThe proof in Mathlib uses the theory of Bernoulli polynomials and Fourier analysis. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Bernoulli polynomials**: Define Bₙ(x) which satisfy specific differential equations\n2. **Fourier expansion**: Express Bₙ(x) as a Fourier series involving 1/nᵏ terms\n3. **Evaluation at x=0**: Setting x=0 extracts the zeta values ζ(2k)\n4. **Basel identity**: For k=1, this gives ζ(2) = π²/6\n\n**Euler's Original Insight (1734)**:\n\nEuler factored sin(x)/x as an infinite product:\n$$\\frac{\\sin x}{x} = \\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{\\pi^2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{4\\pi^2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{x^2}{9\\pi^2}\\right)\\cdots$$\n\nComparing the x² coefficient with the Taylor series of sin(x)/x yields the Basel identity.",

    "summary": "The Basel Problem represents one of the most beautiful identities in mathematics, connecting the simple sum of reciprocal squares to the transcendental number π. Euler's 1734 solution launched his career and opened the door to the theory of zeta functions.\n\nThe formalization uses Mathlib's `hasSum_zeta_two` which proves the identity through the theory of Bernoulli polynomials and Fourier analysis—a rigorous approach that vindicates Euler's brilliant but initially non-rigorous reasoning.",
    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance:**\n\n1. **Riemann Zeta Function**: The Basel identity is ζ(2), the first non-trivial value of the zeta function that connects to prime number theory.\n\n2. **Special Values**: Euler generalized this to ζ(2k) = rational × π^(2k) for all positive integers k, involving Bernoulli numbers.\n\n3. **Odd Zeta Values**: In contrast, ζ(3), ζ(5), etc. have no known closed form—Apéry's proof that ζ(3) is irrational (1978) was a major breakthrough.\n\n**Applications:**\n\nThe Basel identity appears in probability theory (random walks), statistical mechanics, quantum field theory, and number theory. It's also connected to the probability that two random integers are coprime (which equals 6/π²).",
