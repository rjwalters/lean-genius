  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "In 1900, David Hilbert posed 23 problems to guide 20th-century mathematics. The nineteenth problem asked whether solutions of 'regular' variational problems are necessarily analytic (infinitely differentiable with convergent Taylor series).\n\nThis question lies at the heart of PDE theory: if we minimize a well-behaved functional, how smooth is the minimizer?\n\n**Key Contributors:**\n- **Bernstein (1904)**: Solved the 2D case\n- **Schauder (1934)**: Developed Holder estimates for bootstrapping\n- **De Giorgi (1957)**: Revolutionary proof for general dimensions\n- **Nash (1958)**: Independent proof (parabolic case)\n- **Moser (1960)**: Simplified proofs using Harnack inequality\n\nThe resolution established modern elliptic regularity theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Consider a variational problem: minimize J[u] = integral of F(x, u, Du) dx over functions u satisfying boundary conditions.\n\nIf F satisfies:\n1. Smoothness: F is smooth (or analytic) in all arguments\n2. Ellipticity: F is strictly convex in the gradient variable (Legendre condition)\n\n**Question**: Must the minimizer u be smooth (or analytic)?\n\nThis is the 'regularity problem' for elliptic PDEs arising from variational principles.",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof proceeds in stages of increasing regularity:\n\n1. **Existence**: Minimizers exist in weak (Sobolev) spaces\n\n2. **De Giorgi-Nash-Moser**: Weak solutions are Holder continuous\n   - Key: Caccioppoli inequality (energy estimate)\n   - De Giorgi iteration: oscillation decays geometrically\n\n3. **Schauder Bootstrap**: Once Holder, we gain derivatives\n   - C^{k,alpha} coefficients implies C^{k+2,alpha} solution\n   - Iterate to C^infinity\n\n4. **Analyticity**: If F is analytic, solutions are analytic",
