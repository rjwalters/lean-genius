  "description": "Let p(n) be the least prime factor of n. The sum ∑ p(n)/n over composites n < x is ~ c·√x/(log x)². Does a short interval of length C·√x·(log x)² capture a bounded fraction of this sum?",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem appears in Erdős and Graham's 1980 monograph (p. 92). It concerns the distribution of the least prime factor function p(n) weighted by 1/n over short intervals. The global asymptotic ∑_{n<x, composite} p(n)/n ~ c·√x/(log x)² is known.",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist C > 0 such that ∑_{x ≤ n ≤ x + C·√x·(log x)²} p(n)/n ≫ 1 for all large x? In other words, can a short interval of the natural scale capture a bounded-below contribution from least prime factors?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the least prime factor via Nat.minFac, sums over composites (compositeSum) and over intervals (intervalSum), states the known asymptotic as a two-sided bound, and formulates the open conjecture about short intervals.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The global sum ∑ p(n)/n over composites grows as √x/(log x)², so intervals of length √x·(log x)² are the natural scale",
      "The conjecture asks whether the sum is equidistributed enough that every such interval captures O(1) contribution",
      "For composites, the least prime factor is at most √n, bounding individual terms",
      "The least prime factor of a prime equals itself"
