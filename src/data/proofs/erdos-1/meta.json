  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős called this 'perhaps my first serious problem,' dating it to 1931 when he was just 18 years old. A set A has **distinct subset sums** if no two different subsets have the same sum. The question: if A is contained in {1,...,N} with |A| = n and has distinct subset sums, how small can N be?\n\nThe powers of 2, i.e., {1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(n-1)}, trivially have distinct subset sums and give N = 2^(n-1). The conjecture asks whether this is essentially optimal: must N be at least a constant times 2^n?",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be a subset of {1, 2, ..., N} with |A| = n elements. If all 2^n subset sums of A are distinct, then:\n\n**Conjecture (Erdős 1931):** N >> 2^n, meaning N >= c * 2^n for some absolute constant c > 0.\n\n**Prize:** $500 (one of Erdős's original prize problems)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization proves the basic lower bound N >= 2^(n-1) via a counting argument:\n\n1. Define `hasDistinctSubsetSums` as injectivity of the sum function on subsets\n2. Show that distinct subset sums must span a range of size at least 2^n\n3. Since sums are bounded by n*N, we get 2^n <= n*N, giving N >= 2^n/n\n4. A refined argument using the maximum element gives N >= 2^(n-1)\n\nThe full conjecture (N >> 2^n with no 1/n factor) remains OPEN.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Powers of 2 are extremal:** {1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(n-1)} has distinct sums with N = 2^(n-1), showing 2^n is the right order of magnitude.",
      "**Counting argument:** 2^n distinct sums in [0, nN] gives the trivial bound N >= 2^n / n.",
      "**Maximum element bound:** The max element alone must be >= 2^(n-1), proved in our formalization.",
      "**Best known lower bound:** Dubroff-Fox-Xu (2021) proved N >= sqrt(2/pi) * 2^n / sqrt(n).",
      "**Conway-Guy construction:** Upper bound examples show N < 0.22002 * 2^n is achievable."
