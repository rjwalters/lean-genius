  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1969 [Er69b], asking whether high chromatic number forces the existence of triangle-free subgraphs with moderately high chromatic number. This connects to the classical Mycielski construction showing triangle-free graphs can have arbitrarily high chromatic number.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that, for every k, there is some f(k) such that if G has chromatic number ≥ f(k) then G contains a triangle-free subgraph with chromatic number ≥ k?",
    "proofStrategy": "Rödl proved the affirmative answer in 1977 using Ramsey-theoretic techniques. The key insight is that graphs with extremely high chromatic number (tower-type in k) must contain enough structure that a triangle-free piece with chromatic number k survives after removing all triangles.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The threshold function f(k) is a tower of 2s of height roughly k",
      "Triangle-free graphs can have arbitrarily high chromatic number (Mycielski 1955)",
      "The result generalizes to H-free subgraphs for any bipartite graph H"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #923 was proved by Rödl in 1977. For every k, there exists a threshold f(k) (a tower of 2s) such that any graph with chromatic number at least f(k) contains a triangle-free subgraph with chromatic number at least k. This reveals deep Ramsey-theoretic structure in highly chromatic graphs.",
    "implications": "This result demonstrates that high chromatic number cannot be concentrated only in complete subgraphs—it must spread to triangle-free parts as well. The tower-type bound is necessary and connects to fundamental limits in Ramsey theory.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the optimal constant in the tower bound?",
      "Can the result be extended to all graphs H (not just bipartite)?",
      "See Problem #108 for the general H-free version"
