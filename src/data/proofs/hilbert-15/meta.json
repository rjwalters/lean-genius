    "historicalContext": "Schubert (1879) developed counting techniques for geometric configurations. Hilbert asked to make these rigorous. The problem was resolved through intersection theory on Grassmannians.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem:** Rigorously justify Schubert's counting methods.\n\n**Classic Results:**\n- 2 lines meet 4 given lines in 3D\n- 3264 conics tangent to 5 conics\n- 27 lines on a cubic surface",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization uses:\n1. Grassmannians as parameter spaces\n2. Incidence conditions as linear constraints\n3. Intersection theory for counting",
