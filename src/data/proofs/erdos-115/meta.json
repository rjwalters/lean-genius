  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős conjectured that for a degree-n polynomial p with connected lemniscate {z : |p(z)| ≤ 1}, the maximum of |p'| on this set is at most ~n²/2. Szabados noted the conjecture needed an o(1) correction term. Pommerenke proved the weaker bound (e/2)n². Eremenko and Lempert settled the conjecture, confirming the (1/2 + o(1))n² bound with Chebyshev polynomials as extremal examples.",
    "problemStatement": "For a polynomial p(z) of degree n with connected lemniscate L(p) = {z : |p(z)| ≤ 1}, is it true that max_{z ∈ L(p)} |p'(z)| ≤ (1/2 + o(1))n²?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize complex polynomials, lemniscate connectivity, and the maximum derivative on lemniscates. Known bounds (lower bound n, Pommerenke's (e/2)n²) are recorded. The Eremenko–Lempert theorem is stated, and sharpness is proved from the Chebyshev asymptotic.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Connectivity of the lemniscate is essential — without it, derivatives can be arbitrarily large",
      "The monomial z^n gives the minimal case: max|p'| = n on the unit disk",
      "Chebyshev polynomials T_n achieve max|p'| ~ n²/2, showing the bound is sharp",
      "Pommerenke's intermediate bound of (e/2)n² ≈ 1.359n² preceded the sharp result"
