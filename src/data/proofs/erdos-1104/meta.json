  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in 1967. Kim (1995) resolved the dual Ramsey question R(3,k) = Θ(k²/log k). The maximum chromatic number of triangle-free graphs was pinned to Θ(√(n/log n)) by Davies–Illingworth (2022, upper) and Hefty–Horn–King–Pfender (2025, lower).",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be the maximum chromatic number of a triangle-free graph on n vertices. Estimate f(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize f(n) and state the matched upper and lower bounds f(n) = Θ(√(n/log n)). The exact leading constant is the remaining open question.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "f(n) = Θ(√(n/log n)): order of magnitude determined",
      "Davies–Illingworth (2022) proved f(n) ≤ (2+o(1))√(n/log n)",
      "Hefty–Horn–King–Pfender (2025) proved f(n) ≥ (1−o(1))√(n/log n)",
      "Dual to Kim's R(3,k) = Θ(k²/log k)",
      "Exact constant between 1 and 2 remains open"

  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1104 asks for the maximum chromatic number of triangle-free graphs on n vertices. The answer is Θ(√(n/log n)), but the exact leading constant (between 1 and 2) remains unknown.",
    "implications": "Pinning the constant would complete our understanding of the extremal chromatic theory of triangle-free graphs, with applications to Ramsey theory and probabilistic combinatorics.",

      "What is the exact leading constant in f(n) ~ c√(n/log n)?",
