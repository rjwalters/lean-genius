  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős (1995) asked to improve the bounds on the minimum density of Ramsey 2-complete sets. Burr and Erdős (1985) established c(log N)² as a lower bound and (2 log₂ N)³ as an upper bound. Conlon, Fox, and Pham (2021) closed the gap by constructing a Ramsey 2-complete set with counting function O((log N)²).",
    "problemStatement": "Improve the bounds on the minimum growth rate of a Ramsey 2-complete set: c(log N)² ≤ |A ∩ [1,N]| ≤ (2 log₂ N)³.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines 2-colourings, monochromatic subset sums, and Ramsey 2-completeness. The Burr–Erdős lower bound and the Conlon–Fox–Pham optimal construction are axiomatised.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Ramsey 2-completeness requires robustness: every colouring must yield a complete colour class",
      "Burr–Erdős (1985) proved the lower bound c(log N)² and upper bound (2 log₂ N)³",
      "Conlon–Fox–Pham (2021) achieved O((log N)²), matching the lower bound up to constants",
