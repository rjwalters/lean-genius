Must $G$ contain $O(r^2)$ many vertices? Must there be two edges which meet in $\\gg r$ many vertices?\n\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s and Shelah. The Fano geometry gives an example where there are no two edges which meet in $r-1$ vertices. Are there any other examples?\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Lov\\'{a}sz \\cite{ErLo75} proved that there must be two edges which meet in $\\gg \\frac{r}{\\log r}$ many vertices.\n\nAlon has provided the following counterexample to the first question: as vertices take two sets $X$ and $Y$ of sizes $2r-2$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\binom{2r-2}{r-1}$ respectively, where $Y$ corresponds to all partitions of $X$ into two equal parts. The edges are all subsets of $X$ of size $r$, and also all sets consisting of a subset of $X$ of size $r-1$ together with the unique element of $Y$ corresponding to the induced partition of $X$.\n\nThis hypergraph is intersecting, its chromatic number is $3$, and it has $\\asymp 4^r/\\sqrt{r}$ many vertices.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErLo75] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Lov\\'{a}sz, L., Problems and results on {$3$}-chromatic hypergraphs and some\nrelated questions.
