  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem of Erdős and Shelah concerns the structure of r-uniform, intersecting, 3-chromatic hypergraphs. Erdős-Lovász (1975) proved the edge intersection bound. Alon later provided a counterexample showing exponentially many vertices are possible, disproving the O(r²) conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let r ≥ 2 and G be an r-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number 3 where any two edges intersect. Q1: Must G have O(r²) vertices? Q2: Must two edges meet in ≫r vertices?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines hypergraphs, uniformity, intersection, and chromatic number. Question 1 is shown false via Alon's counterexample with ~4^r/√r vertices. Question 2 has partial answer: Erdős-Lovász proved ≫r/log r intersection.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Q1 is FALSE: Alon's counterexample has ~4^r/√r vertices",
      "Q2 is PARTIAL: Erdős-Lovász proved two edges meet in ≫r/log r vertices",
      "Fano plane is extremal: 3-uniform, no two edges share r-1 vertices",
      "2-chromatic intersecting implies star (all edges share one vertex)",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #836 is SOLVED. Question 1 (O(r²) vertices) is FALSE - Alon's counterexample has exponentially many vertices. Question 2 (large edge intersection) has partial answer: Erdős-Lovász proved two edges meet in Ω(r/log r) vertices.",
