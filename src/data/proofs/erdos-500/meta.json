  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Turán posed this problem in 1941, making it one of the oldest open problems in extremal combinatorics. It asks for the maximum number of 3-element subsets of an n-element set that can be chosen without containing all four 3-subsets of any 4-element set. Despite decades of effort and the development of powerful tools like flag algebras, the exact answer remains unknown.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine ex₃(n, K₄³), the maximum number of 3-edges on n vertices with no complete 3-uniform 4-vertex subhypergraph. Equivalently, determine the Turán density π(K₄³).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the 3-uniform hypergraph Turán number, define the Turán density, state Turán's lower bound from his 3-partition construction, Razborov's flag algebra upper bound, and the conjecture that π(K₄³) = 5/9.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Turán's 1941 construction partitions vertices into 3 equal parts, yielding density 5/9",
      "Razborov (2010) used flag algebras to prove π(K₄³) ≤ 0.5612, the best known bound",
      "The gap between 5/9 ≈ 0.5556 and 0.5612 is remarkably small but unresolved",
      "Exact values are known for small n: ex₃(4)=3, ex₃(5)=7, ex₃(6)=13",
      "This is considered one of the most important open problems in combinatorics"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #500 (Turán's hypergraph problem) asks for the Turán density of K₄³. Turán conjectured π(K₄³) = 5/9 in 1941. The best known bounds are 5/9 ≤ π(K₄³) ≤ 0.5612 (Razborov 2010). The problem remains wide open despite 80+ years of effort.",
    "implications": "A resolution would be a landmark in extremal combinatorics, potentially establishing new methods for hypergraph Turán problems. It would also resolve the simplest nontrivial case of the general hypergraph Turán problem.",

      "Is Turán's 3-partition construction optimal? (π(K₄³) = 5/9?)",
