    "historicalContext": "Erdős conjectured in 1969 that almost-bipartite graphs can have infinite chromatic number. Erdős and Hajnal proved this for large linear deviations in 1967, and with Szemerédi extended to all linear deviations in 1982. The sublinear case remains the frontier.",
    "problemStatement": "For any f : ℕ → ℕ with f(m) → ∞, does there exist a graph G with χ(G) = ∞ such that every m-vertex subgraph has an independent set of size ≥ m/2 - f(m)?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the almost-bipartite property, state the main conjecture, and record the Erdős–Hajnal and EHS82 solutions for the linear case. The sublinear case is stated as open, with specific instances (√m, log m).",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Bipartite graphs have independent sets of exactly ⌈m/2⌉; deviation measures local non-bipartiteness",
      "Erdős–Hajnal (1967) handles deviations > m/4",

  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #750 asks whether infinite chromatic number is compatible with being 'almost bipartite' locally. The linear case is settled (EHS82), but sublinear error functions f(m) = o(m) remain open, including f(m) = √m and f(m) = log m.",
