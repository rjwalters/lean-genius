  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem, originating with Galvin (1973), asks whether graphs with infinite chromatic number 𝔪 must have subgraphs of all smaller infinite chromatic numbers. Galvin proved the countable case. The problem became set-theoretically interesting when Komjáth (1988) showed counterexamples exist in certain models, and Shelah (1990) proved the property holds under V=L. It remains open under GCH.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SET-THEORETIC INDEPENDENCE)**\n\nLet 𝔪 be an infinite cardinal and G a graph with χ(G) = 𝔪.\n\n**Question:** For every infinite cardinal 𝔫 < 𝔪, must G have a subgraph with χ = 𝔫?\n\n**Answer:** INDEPENDENT OF ZFC\n- YES under V=L (Shelah 1990)\n- NO in some models (Komjáth 1988)\n- OPEN under GCH",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines chromatic number for infinite graphs using cardinals. Galvin's theorem for ℵ₀ is axiomatized. The induced subgraph variant and its set-theoretic implications are formalized. Komjáth's consistency result and Shelah's V=L theorem are stated. The open question under GCH is highlighted.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #739 exhibits SET-THEORETIC INDEPENDENCE. Whether graphs with chromatic number 𝔪 have subgraphs of all smaller infinite chromatic numbers depends on the model of set theory. Galvin proved the countable case. Komjáth showed counterexamples exist in models where continuum function collapses. Shelah proved YES under V=L. The question under GCH remains open.",
    "implications": "This problem reveals deep connections between infinite combinatorics and set theory. Questions that seem purely graph-theoretic can depend on the foundations of mathematics. The independence phenomenon shows limits of what can be proved in standard set theory.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does GCH imply the property holds for all graphs?",
      "What happens for other large cardinal axioms?",
      "Can we characterize exactly which models satisfy the property?"
