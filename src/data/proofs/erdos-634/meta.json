    "historicalContext": "**Triangle Dissection Problem**\n\nErdős asked: for which n can some triangle be dissected into n congruent (same size and shape) triangular pieces?\n\n**Known Positive Results**: Perfect squares k² (divide sides into k parts), plus 2k², 3k², 6k², and sums of two squares k²+m². Also 27 via special construction.\n\n**Known Negative Results**: Beeson proved 7 and 11 are impossible.\n\n**The Similar Case**: Soifer completely solved the analogous problem for similar (not congruent) triangles: all n except 2, 3, 5 work.\n\n**Open**: Whether 19 works remains unknown. A $25 prize is offered for a complete characterization.",

    "proofStrategy": "**The Formalization**\n\n1. Defines triangles via side lengths (a, b, c) with triangle inequality\n2. Defines congruence as equality of side length multisets\n3. Defines similar triangles (proportional sides)\n4. Defines dissection structure and congruent dissection\n5. States positive results for various n forms\n6. Axiomatizes Beeson's impossibility proofs for 7, 11\n7. States the 4k+3 prime conjecture\n8. Covers Soifer's theorem on similar dissections\n9. Covers Snover-Waiveris-Williams self-similar characterization\n10. Analyzes the open case n = 19",

    "implications": "**Theoretical Significance**\n\n1. **Geometry vs Number Theory**: Dissectability connects geometry to number-theoretic properties (4k+3 primes)\n\n2. **Congruence vs Similarity**: The similar problem is completely solved; congruence is much harder\n\n3. **Algorithmic Questions**: No known algorithm to decide dissectability for arbitrary n\n\n4. **Open Prize Problem**: One of the remaining Erdős problems with unclaimed prize",
