For any $x$ define $t_x$ by\\[u_1\\cdots u_{t_x}\\leq x< u_1\\cdots u_{t_x}u_{t_x+1}.\\]We call such a sequence $u_i$ good if, for all $\\epsilon>0$, if $x$ is sufficiently large then\\[\\max_{a_k<x} (a_{k+1}-a_k) < (1+\\epsilon)t_x \\prod_{i}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{u_i}\\right)^{-1}.\\]Is there a good sequence such that $u_n< n^{O(1)}$? Is there a good sequence such that $u_n\\leq e^{o(n)}$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er81h} believed the answer to the first question is no and the second question is yes. He proved the existence of some good sequence (in which all the $u_i$ are primes).\n\nAn easy sieve argument proves that we always have, for any sequence $u$ with those properties,\\[\\max_{a_k<x} (a_{k+1}-a_k)> (1+o(1))t_x \\prod_{i}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{u_i}\\right)^{-1}.\\]The strong form of [208] is asking whether if $u_i=p_i^2$, the sequence of prime squares, is good.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81h] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some problems and results on additive and multiplicative\nnumber theory.
