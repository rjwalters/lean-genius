    "content": "Erdős Problem #1101 asks about 'good' sequences of pairwise coprime integers. Given such a sequence u with convergent reciprocal series, the integers not divisible by any uᵢ form a sparse set A. Erdős defined u as 'good' if gaps in A match the theoretical bound from sieve theory.\n\nThe two main questions:\n1. Can a good sequence have polynomial growth? (Conjectured NO)\n2. Can a good sequence have sub-exponential growth? (Conjectured YES)",
    "mathContext": "This connects sieve theory with questions about multiplicative sequences. The 'density' of A is ∏(1-1/uᵢ), and sieve theory shows gaps are at least (1+o(1))·tₓ·∏(1-1/uᵢ)⁻¹.",
