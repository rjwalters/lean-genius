  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #705 was posed by Erdős in 1981 (p. 27 of the source). It asks whether forbidding short cycles in unit distance graphs forces the chromatic number down to at most 3. This sits at the intersection of graph theory and combinatorial geometry, closely related to the famous Hadwiger-Nelson problem about the chromatic number of the plane.\n\nThe key constructions are: the Moser spindle (1961, 7 vertices, girth 3, χ = 4), O'Donnell's graph (1994, 56 vertices, girth 4, χ = 4), Chilakamarri's graph (1995, 47 vertices, girth 4, χ = 4), and Wormald's graph (1979, 6448 vertices, girth 5, χ = 4). These show that avoiding short cycles up to length 4 does not force 3-colorability. The frontier is girth 6: no 4-chromatic unit distance graph with girth ≥ 6 is known.\n\nA crucial contrast: for abstract graphs (without geometric constraints), Erdős proved in 1959 that graphs with arbitrarily large girth AND chromatic number exist, using the probabilistic method. But unit distance graphs are constrained by Euclidean geometry. Problem #705 asks whether this geometric constraint eventually forces χ ≤ 3 when short cycles are excluded.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $G$ be a finite unit distance graph in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nIs there some $k$ such that if $G$ has girth $\\geq k$, then $\\chi(G) \\leq 3$?\n\n**Known:** $k > 5$ if it exists, since Wormald constructed a 4-chromatic unit distance graph with girth 5.\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization proceeds in ten parts:\n\n1. **Unit distance graphs:** Define adjacency (distance = 1) and the unit distance graph on point sets in ℝ².\n\n2. **Graph parameters:** Axiomatize chromatic number and girth.\n\n3. **Known constructions:** Axiomatize the Moser spindle, O'Donnell, Wormald, and Chilakamarri graphs with their properties.\n\n4. **The conjecture:** Define erdos_705_conjecture and its negation.\n\n5. **Consequences:** Derive girth-specific results from the construction axioms.\n\n6. **Context:** Connect to the Hadwiger-Nelson problem and Erdős's 1959 result on abstract graphs.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #705 asks whether sufficiently large girth forces finite unit distance graphs to be 3-colorable. Known constructions show 4-chromatic UDGs exist with girth up to 5, but no girth-6 example is known. The problem remains open, sitting at the frontier between combinatorial graph theory and Euclidean geometry.",
    "implications": "A positive answer would reveal a fundamental limitation of Euclidean geometry on graph coloring: unlike abstract graphs, unit distance graphs cannot simultaneously have large girth and high chromatic number. A negative answer (constructing 4-chromatic UDGs at every girth) would show that the geometric constraint is insufficient to control coloring.",
