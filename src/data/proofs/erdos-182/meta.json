  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős and Sauer** posed this problem in 1975, asking about the maximum edge density that avoids k-regular subgraphs.\n\n**Timeline**:\n- **1975**: Erdős poses the problem in 'Some recent progress on extremal problems in graph theory'\n- **1995**: **Pyber, Rödl, and Szemerédi** construct graphs with Ω(n log log n) edges and no 3-regular subgraph, establishing the lower bound\n- **2023**: **Janzer and Sudakov** prove the matching upper bound in 'Resolution of the Erdős-Sauer problem on regular subgraphs', completing the solution\n\n**Key insight**: The log log n factor arises from an iterative argument where each step reduces the graph while preserving structure. The iteration depth is O(log log n).",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdős Problem #182**: Let k >= 3. What is the maximum number of edges that a graph on n vertices can contain if it does not have a k-regular subgraph? Is it << n^{1+o(1)}?\n\n**Answer**: The maximum is **Θ(n log log n)**.\n\n- **Upper bound** (Janzer-Sudakov 2023): Any graph with >= C·n·log(log n) edges contains a k-regular subgraph\n- **Lower bound** (Pyber-Rödl-Szemerédi 1995): There exist graphs with Ω(n log log n) edges and no k-regular subgraph\n\n**Variant**: For connected k-regular subgraphs, Erdős proved F(n,3) << n^{5/3}.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize this problem by:\n\n1. **Graph definitions**: IsRegular (k-regular), HasKRegularSubgraph (subgraph containment)\n\n2. **Main theorems**: Janzer-Sudakov upper bound and Pyber-Rödl-Szemerédi lower bound as axioms\n\n3. **Extremal function**: Definition of f(n,k) as maximum edges without k-regular subgraph\n\n4. **Special cases**: k=2 (forests), k=1 (matchings), connected variants\n\n5. **Probabilistic aspects**: Dense graphs almost surely contain regular subgraphs",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Θ(n log log n) bound**: Both upper and lower bounds match, fully resolving the problem.",
      "**Iterative argument**: The log log n factor comes from O(log log n) reduction steps, each preserving enough structure.",
      "**k=2 special case**: Graphs without 2-regular subgraphs are exactly forests, with at most n-1 edges.",
      "**Connected variant**: Requiring the k-regular subgraph to be connected gives weaker bound O(n^{5/3}).",
      "**Dense graphs**: For any epsilon > 0, graphs with >= epsilon·n^2 edges contain k-regular subgraphs."

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #182 about maximum edges avoiding k-regular subgraphs. The problem was posed by Erdős and Sauer in 1975 and fully resolved in 2023 by Janzer and Sudakov. The answer is Θ(n log log n): any graph with more than C·n·log(log n) edges must contain a k-regular subgraph, and Pyber-Rödl-Szemerédi showed this bound is tight.",

The log log n factor is unusual and arises from an iterative reduction argument. The result connects to structural graph theory and has applications in understanding graph decomposition.",
