What is the maximum number of edges that a graph on $n$ vertices can contain if it does not have a $k$-regular subgraph? Is it $\\ll n^{1+o(1)}$?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Sauer. Resolved by Janzer and Sudakov \\cite{JaSu23}, who proved that there exists some $C=C(k)>0$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices with at least $Cn\\log\\log n$ edges contains a $k$-regular subgraph.\n\nA construction due to Pyber, R\\\"{o}dl, and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{PRS95} shows that this is best possible.\n\nIn \\cite{Er75} Erd\\H{o}s mentions a similar question of Szemer\\'{e}di, in which the $k$-regular subgraph must be connected. Let $F(n,k)$ be the smallest number of edges on $n$ vertices which guarantee a connected $k$-regular subgraph. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75} proved $F(n,3) \\ll n^{5/3}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er75] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some recent progress on extremal problems in graph theory. Congr. Numer.
