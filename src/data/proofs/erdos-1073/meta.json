    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Hardy, and Subbarao asked how many composite numbers divide n!+1 for some n. By Wilson's theorem, every prime p divides (p-1)!+1. The known composite sequence starts 25, 121, 169, 437, ... (OEIS A256519). The conjecture is that A(x) grows subpolynomially.",

    "proofStrategy": "We define DividesFactorialPlusOne for the divisibility condition, compositeFactorialSet and factorialCompositeCount for the counting function. The main conjecture is stated as subpolynomial growth. Wilson's theorem and known composites are included.",
