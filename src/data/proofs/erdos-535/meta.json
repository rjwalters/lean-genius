  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem connects number theory to extremal combinatorics. The function f_r(N) measures the maximum 'gcd-avoiding' subset. Erdős showed this connects deeply to the Sunflower Conjecture - a major open problem in combinatorics. Progress on either would impact the other.",
    "problemStatement": "For r ≥ 3, let f_r(N) denote the maximum size of a subset A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that no r elements a₁,...,aᵣ have the same pairwise gcd (i.e., no d with gcd(aᵢ,aⱼ) = d for all i ≠ j). Estimate f_r(N).",
    "proofStrategy": "Upper bounds use counting/graph-theoretic methods. Erdős (1964) got N^{3/4}, Abbott-Hanson (1970) improved to N^{1/2}. Lower bounds use multiplicative constructions. The gap between N^{1/2} (upper) and N^{c/log log N} (lower) remains open, with Erdős conjecturing the lower bound is correct.",
