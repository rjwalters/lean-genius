Estimate $f_r(N)$.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64} proved that\\[f_r(N) \\leq N^{\\frac{3}{4}+o(1)},\\]and Abbott and Hanson \\cite{AbHa70} improved this exponent to $1/2$. Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er64} proved the lower bound\\[f_3(N) > N^{\\frac{c}{\\log\\log N}}\\]for some constant $c>0$, and conjectured this should also be an upper bound.\n\nErd\\H{o}s writes this is 'intimately connected' with the sunflower problem [20]. Indeed, the conjectured upper bound would follow from the following stronger version of the sunflower problem: estimate the size of the largest set of integers $A$ such that $\\omega(n)=k$ for all $n\\in A$ and there does not exist $a_1,\\ldots,a_r\\in A$ and an integer $d$ such that $(a_i,a_j)=d$ for all $i\\neq j$ and $(a_i/d,d)=1$ for all $i$. The conjectured upper bound for $f_r(N)$ would follow if the size of such an $A$ must be at most $c_r^k$. The original sunflower proof of Erd\\H{o}s and Rado gives the upper bound $c_r^kk!$.\n\nSee also [536].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[AbHa70] Abbott, H.
