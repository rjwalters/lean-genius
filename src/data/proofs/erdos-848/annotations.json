    "content": "IsSquarefree(n) holds when no prime squared divides n. HasNonSqfreeProductProp(A) requires ab + 1 to be non-squarefree for all a, b ∈ A. maxNonSqfreeSet(N) is the maximum cardinality of such a set in {1,...,N}.",

    "content": "The set {n ≡ 7 (mod 25)} satisfies the property: for a ≡ b ≡ 7 (mod 25), ab + 1 ≡ 49 + 1 = 50 ≡ 0 (mod 25), so 5² | ab + 1. Similarly for {n ≡ 18 (mod 25)}. This gives |A| ≈ N/25.",

    "content": "Van Doorn showed |A|/N ≤ 2 Σ_{p ≡ 1 (4)} 1/p² ≈ 0.108 using the fact that a² + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p²) has 2 solutions for p ≡ 1 (mod 4) and 0 solutions for p ≡ 3 (mod 4). Weisenberg refined this to ≈ 0.105.",

    "content": "Sawhney proved that for all sufficiently large N, maxNonSqfreeSet(N) = ⌊N/25⌋. Any extremal set must be contained in {n ≡ 7 (mod 25)} or {n ≡ 18 (mod 25)}.",

    "content": "Any extremal set of size N/25 in {1,...,N} for large N must consist entirely of elements ≡ 7 (mod 25) or entirely of elements ≡ 18 (mod 25). No mixing of residue classes is possible.",
    "significance": "The uniqueness of extremal sets (up to the 7 ↔ 18 symmetry) is a strong structural result beyond just determining the maximum size."
