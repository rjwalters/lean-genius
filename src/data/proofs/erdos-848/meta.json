  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Sárközy (1992) asked for the maximum size of A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that ab + 1 is never squarefree for a, b ∈ A. The sets {n ≡ 7 (mod 25)} and {n ≡ 18 (mod 25)} satisfy the property because 7·7 + 1 = 50 = 2·5², so 5² always divides ab + 1 for these residue classes. Van Doorn gave an upper bound of ≈ 0.108N. Sawhney proved the answer is exactly N/25 for large N.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine the maximum size of A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that ab + 1 is never squarefree for all a, b ∈ A.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsSquarefree constructively, axiomatize maxNonSqfreeSet, and record the mod 25 lower bound, van Doorn's upper bound, and Sawhney's exact solution with structural characterization.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For a ≡ b ≡ 7 (mod 25), ab + 1 ≡ 50 (mod 25), so 5² | ab + 1",
      "The same holds for a ≡ b ≡ 18 (mod 25) since 18·18 + 1 = 325 = 13·25",
      "Van Doorn's bound uses quadratic residues: a² + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p²) for p ≡ 1 (mod 4)",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #848 is solved for large N by Sawhney: the maximum is N/25, achieved by {n ≡ 7 (mod 25)} or {n ≡ 18 (mod 25)}. The key insight is that these residue classes force 5² to divide ab + 1.",
