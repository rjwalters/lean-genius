    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the function f(n) = ∑_{p<n} 1/(n−p), which measures how 'close' n is to primes by weighting nearby primes more heavily. De Bruijn, Erdős, and Turán showed that ∑_{n<x} f(n) ~ x and ∑_{n<x} f(n)² ~ x, meaning f(n) averages to 1 and concentrates near 1. The three questions probe the extremal behavior.",
    "problemStatement": "Define f(n) = ∑_{p<n} 1/(n−p) where p ranges over primes. Three questions: (1) Is lim inf f(n) = 1? (2) Is lim sup f(n) = ∞? (3) Is f(n) = o(log log n)? All three remain OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines primesLessThan, f, and fReal. The three questions are stated as formal propositions using Filter.liminf, Filter.limsup, and Filter.Eventually. Known average results are axioms. Basic properties (nonnegativity, small values) are proved or axiomatized. A weaker conjecture and its implication are included. A summary theorem combines the known results.",

      "de Bruijn–Erdős–Turán: f(n) averages to 1 (∑ f(n) ~ x, ∑ f(n)² ~ x)",
