    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the function f(n) = ∑_{p<n} 1/(n-p), which measures how 'close' n is to primes by weighting nearby primes more heavily. De Bruijn, Erdős, and Turán showed that ∑_{n<x} f(n) ~ x and ∑_{n<x} f(n)² ~ x, meaning f(n) averages to 1.",
    "problemStatement": "Define f(n) = ∑_{p<n} 1/(n-p) where p ranges over primes. Three questions: (1) Is lim inf f(n) = 1? (2) Is lim sup f(n) = ∞? (3) Is f(n) = o(log log n) for all n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The known average results suggest f(n) fluctuates around 1. Question 1 asks if f(n) can get arbitrarily close to 1 from below. Question 2 asks if f(n) can be arbitrarily large. Question 3 asks for a universal upper bound.",
