  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was conjectured by Choi in 1971, who proved f(n) ≪ n^{3/4}. Adenwalla gave a simple construction showing f(n) ≫ n^{1/2}. Hunter improved the upper bound to n^{2/3+o(1)}. The best known bound f(n) ≪ (n log n)^{2/3} was proved by Baltz, Schoen, and Srivastav in 2000 using probabilistic methods and Sidon sets.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be maximal such that for all B ⊂ (2n,4n) ∩ ℕ, there exists C ⊂ (n,2n) ∩ ℕ with c₁ + c₂ ∉ B for all c₁ ≠ c₂ ∈ C and |C| + |B| ≥ f(n). Estimate f(n). Is f(n) ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sum-free sets with respect to a prescribed set, the function f(n), and Sidon sets. Known bounds are axiomatized: Choi's n^{3/4}, Adenwalla's n^{1/2} lower bound, Hunter's n^{2/3+o(1)}, and BSS's (n log n)^{2/3}.",
