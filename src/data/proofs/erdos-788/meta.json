  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #788: Sum-Free Subsets in Intervals**\n\nThis problem asks about the interplay between sum-free sets and interval arithmetic. Given a \"forbidden\" set B in the interval (2n, 4n), we seek a large set C in (n, 2n) such that no two distinct elements of C sum to an element of B. The key observation is that sums of elements from (n, 2n) naturally land in (2n, 4n), making these intervals the natural setting.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- Choi (1971): First studied this problem systematically, proving f(n) ≪ n^{3/4} and conjecturing f(n) ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}\n- Adenwalla: Provided the lower bound f(n) ≫ n^{1/2} using a clever Sidon set construction\n- Hunter: Improved the upper bound to n^{2/3+o(1)} via counting arguments\n- Baltz, Schoen, Srivastav (2000): Achieved the current best upper bound f(n) ≪ (n log n)^{2/3} using probabilistic methods\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe function f(n) captures the \"guaranteed combined size\" of C and B - no matter how an adversary chooses B, we can always find C such that |C| + |B| ≥ f(n). This min-max formulation connects to game-theoretic aspects of additive combinatorics.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be maximal such that for all B ⊂ (2n,4n) ∩ ℕ, there exists C ⊂ (n,2n) ∩ ℕ with c₁ + c₂ ∉ B for all c₁ ≠ c₂ ∈ C and |C| + |B| ≥ f(n). Estimate f(n). Is f(n) ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sum-free sets with respect to a prescribed set, the function f(n), and Sidon sets. Known bounds are axiomatized: Choi's n^{3/4}, Adenwalla's n^{1/2} lower bound, Hunter's n^{2/3+o(1)}, and BSS's (n log n)^{2/3}.",
