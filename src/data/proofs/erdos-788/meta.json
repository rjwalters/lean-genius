  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about the interplay between sum-free sets and interval arithmetic. Given a 'forbidden' set B in (2n, 4n), we seek a large set C in (n, 2n) whose pairwise sums avoid B. The function f(n) measures the guaranteed combined size |C| + |B|.\n\nChoi (1971) first studied this, proving f(n) ≪ n^{3/4} and conjecturing f(n) ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}. Adenwalla gave the lower bound f(n) ≫ n^{1/2} via Sidon sets. Hunter improved the upper bound to n^{2/3+o(1)}. Baltz, Schoen, and Srivastav (2000) achieved the current best f(n) ≪ (n log n)^{2/3} using probabilistic methods.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be maximal such that for all B ⊂ (2n,4n) ∩ ℕ, there exists C ⊂ (n,2n) ∩ ℕ with c₁ + c₂ ∉ B for all c₁ ≠ c₂ ∈ C and |C| + |B| ≥ f(n). Estimate f(n). Is f(n) ≤ n^{1/2+o(1)}?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sum-free sets with respect to a prescribed set, the function f(n) via Nat.find, and Sidon sets. Known bounds are axiomatized: Choi's n^{3/4}, Adenwalla's n^{1/2} lower bound, Hunter's n^{2/3+o(1)}, and BSS's (n log n)^{2/3}. The interval_sum_range theorem is proved directly. Summary theorems combine the known bounds.",
