  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdos and Graham posed this problem in their 1980 monograph 'Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory' [ErGr80, p.32].\n\nUnit fractions (Egyptian fractions) have been studied since ancient Egypt - the Rhind Papyrus (c. 1650 BCE) contains tables of unit fraction representations. The question of counting decompositions of 1 connects ancient mathematics to modern combinatorics.\n\nThe problem has seen significant progress: Konyagin (2014) improved lower bounds, and Elsholtz-Planitzer (2021) gave the best current upper bounds involving the Vardi constant.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nFind good estimates for F(k), the number of ways to write\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n_k}$$\nwhere $1 \\leq n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots < n_k$ are distinct positive integers.\n\n**Best Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: $F(k) \\geq 2^{c \\cdot k / \\log k}$ (Konyagin 2014)\n- Upper: $F(k) \\leq c_0^{(1/5+o(1)) \\cdot 2^k}$ (Elsholtz-Planitzer 2021)\n\nwhere $c_0 \\approx 1.26408$ is the Vardi constant.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Unit Fractions:** Define unitFraction(n) = 1/n and unitFractionSum over Finsets\n\n2. **Decompositions:** isEgyptianDecomposition checks if a set sums to 1\n\n3. **Counting Function:** F(k) = |{S : |S| = k and isEgyptianDecomposition(S)}|\n\n4. **Small Cases:** Verify F(1)=1, F(2)=0, F(3)=1\n\n5. **Bounds:** Axiomatize Konyagin and Elsholtz-Planitzer results",
