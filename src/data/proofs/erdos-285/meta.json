  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Egyptian fractions — sums of distinct unit fractions — date to ancient Egypt (the Rhind papyrus, ~1650 BCE). Every positive rational has infinitely many Egyptian fraction representations, but the question of how 'efficient' these can be remained open.\n\nErdős asked: if we want 1 = 1/n₁ + ··· + 1/nₖ with the smallest possible largest denominator nₖ, what is f(k)? The trivial lower bound f(k) ≥ (1+o(1))·e/(e-1)·k follows from the harmonic series.\n\nGreg Martin (2000) proved this bound is tight: f(k) = (1+o(1))·e/(e-1)·k. His paper 'Denser Egyptian Fractions' constructs explicit representations achieving this asymptotic.",
    "problemStatement": "**Definition**: Let $f(k)$ be the minimal value of the largest denominator $n_k$ such that there exist positive integers $n_1 < n_2 < \\cdots < n_k$ with\n$$1 = \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{n_k}$$\n\n**Question**: Is $f(k) = (1 + o(1)) \\cdot \\frac{e}{e-1} \\cdot k$?\n\n**Answer**: YES (Martin 2000)\n\nThe constant $e/(e-1) \\approx 1.5819$ is optimal.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize:\n\n1. **Egyptian fraction representations**: Strictly increasing sequences of positive integers whose reciprocals sum to 1\n\n2. **The function f(k)**: Minimum of the largest denominator over all k-term representations\n\n3. **The Egyptian constant**: e/(e-1) ≈ 1.5819...\n\n4. **Martin's result as an axiom**: f(k) = (1+o(1))·e/(e-1)·k\n\n5. **The trivial lower bound**: Also stated as an axiom, though it follows from harmonic series analysis",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The constant e/(e-1)**: Arises because ∑_{e ≤ n ≤ eu} 1/n ≈ 1 for any u. The interval [e, eu] contains about (e-1)u integers, each contributing ~1/eu on average.",
      "**Lower bound reasoning**: If nₖ ≈ eu, we need (e-1)u terms from [e, eu] to sum to ~1. So k ≤ (e-1)u = (e-1)/e · nₖ, giving f(k) ≥ e/(e-1) · k.",
      "**Martin's construction**: The upper bound requires carefully choosing denominators to avoid 'gaps' while maintaining efficiency. Martin's greedy-style algorithm achieves the optimal constant.",
      "**Historical significance**: This connects ancient Egyptian mathematics (Rhind papyrus algorithms) to modern analytic number theory.",
      "**Practical implications**: For k=100 terms, f(100) ≈ 158. We can represent 1 using 100 distinct unit fractions with largest denominator ~158."
