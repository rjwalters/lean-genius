  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether all large n can be represented as 2^k + m with few prime factors. Related to Romanoff's theorem (1934) on 2^k + prime representations and Erdős's work on covering systems.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that all sufficiently large n can be written as 2^k + m for some k ≥ 0, where Ω(m) < log log m? Here Ω(m) counts prime divisors with multiplicity.",
    "proofStrategy": "The disproof uses a counterexample construction: there exist infinitely many n such that ALL remainders n - 2^k have at least c√(log n / log log n) prime factors, which dominates log log n for large n.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Ω(n) averages to log log n by classical results (Hardy-Ramanujan)",
      "Almost all n DO have such representations (probabilistic argument)",
      "But infinitely many n fail: all their remainders have too many prime factors",
      "The threshold √(log n / log log n) grows faster than log log n",
      "Related to covering systems and 2^k + prime representations"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #205 is DISPROVED. Barreto-Leeham (2026) showed there are infinitely many n where every remainder n - 2^k has Ω ≥ c√(log n / log log n) prime factors, which exceeds log log m for large n.",
    "implications": "Even with the very weak bound Ω(m) < log log m, not all integers can be represented as 2^k + m. This strengthens our understanding of the limitations of power-of-2 representations.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the optimal growth rate f(n) such that all large n have representation with Ω(m) < f(n)?",
      "Can the density of exceptions be quantified?",
      "What is the structure of the exceptional n?"
