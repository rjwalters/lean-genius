(Here $\\Omega(m)$ is the number of prime divisors of $m$ counted with multiplicity.) What about $<\\epsilon \\log\\log m$? Or some more slowly growing function?\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see by probabilistic methods that this holds for almost all integers. Romanoff \\cite{Ro34} showed that a positive density set of integers are representable as the sum of $2^k+p$ for prime $p$, and Erd\\H{o}s used covering systems to show that there is a positive density set of odd integers which cannot be so represented.\n\nSee also [851].\n\nBarreto and Leeham, using ChatGPT and Aristotle, have proved a negative answer: in fact there are infinitely many $n$ such that, for all $k$ with $2^k<n$, $n-2^k$ has at\\[\\gg \\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right)^{1/2}\\]many prime factors.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ro34] Romanoff, N.
