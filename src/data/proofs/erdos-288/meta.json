    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #288 from [ErGr80] asks about pairs of intervals whose harmonic sums give positive integers. The example 1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/20 = 1 uses intervals [3,6] and [20,20]. The problem connects to Egyptian fractions and unit fraction representations.",
    "problemStatement": "Is it true that there are only finitely many pairs of intervals I₁, I₂ such that Σ_{n₁ ∈ I₁} 1/n₁ + Σ_{n₂ ∈ I₂} 1/n₂ is a positive integer? OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines harmonicInterval over ℚ, IntervalPair, the integer sum condition, and the main conjecture as Set.Finite. Variants for singleton I₂ and k-interval generalization are axiomatized. The equivalence theorem is proved by simp.",

      "Harmonic sums over intervals are rational numbers; the question is when they sum to integers",
      "The known example 1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/20 = 1 uses intervals [3,6] and [20,20]",
      "The problem is open even when I₂ has a single element",
      "A natural generalization asks about k intervals for any k",
