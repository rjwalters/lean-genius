  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1112** originates from a remark in Erdős and Graham's 1980 monograph \"Old and New Problems and Results in Combinatorial Number Theory.\" The problem asks about the interplay between lacunary sequences (exponentially growing, very sparse sequences) and k-fold sumsets of sequences with bounded consecutive gaps.\n\nThe core question is a generalization of a result Erdős and Graham proved for k=2: if B is sufficiently lacunary (specifically, 2-lacunary with b₁ ≥ 5), then one can find a sequence A with gaps in [2,3] such that A+A avoids B entirely. They noted that 'whether such behavior can hold for A+A+A (or more summands) is not known.'\n\n**Key Historical Developments:**\n- **1980 (Erdős-Graham):** Proved r₂(2,3) = 2, meaning 2-lacunary sequences can be avoided by 2-fold sumsets with [2,3] gaps.\n- **1997 (Bollobás-Hegyvári-Jin):** Proved the striking negative result that r₃(2,3) does NOT exist - no matter how lacunary B is, any A with [2,3] gaps will have A+A+A intersecting B.\n- **2000 (Chen):** Generalized the k=2 case, showing r₂(a,b) ≤ 2 whenever b ≠ 2a.\n- **2021 (Tang-Yang):** Further technical non-existence results for k ≥ 3.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Resolved)**\n\nLet $1 \\leq d_1 < d_2$ and $k \\geq 3$. Does there exist an integer $r$ such that if $B = \\{b_1 < b_2 < \\cdots\\}$ is a lacunary sequence with $b_{i+1} \\geq r \\cdot b_i$, then there exists a sequence $A = \\{a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq a_{i+1} - a_i \\leq d_2$ such that $(kA) \\cap B = \\emptyset$?\n\n**Partial Answers:**\n- For $k = 2$: YES, $r_2(2,3) = 2$ (Erdős-Graham 1980, extended by Chen 2000)\n- For $k = 3$: NO, $r_3(2,3)$ does not exist (Bollobás-Hegyvári-Jin 1997)\n- General $k \\geq 3$: OPEN - multiple non-existence results known (Tang-Yang 2021)\n\nThe problem exhibits a phase transition at $k = 3$: avoidance is possible for 2-fold sumsets but impossible for 3-fold sumsets.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:** Define lacunary sequences (r-lacunary growth), bounded gap sequences, and k-fold sumsets.\n\n2. **Avoidance Predicates:** Formalize AvoidancePossible(k, r, d₁, d₂) and RkExists(k, d₁, d₂) to capture the problem.\n\n3. **Main Results as Axioms:** The deep results (Erdős-Graham, Bollobás-Hegyvári-Jin, Chen) require sophisticated combinatorial arguments beyond direct Lean verification, so they are axiomatized.\n\n4. **Summary Theorems:** Combine axioms to express the essential dichotomy: r₂(2,3) exists but r₃(2,3) does not.\n\n5. **Intuition Theorems:** Explain why the phase transition occurs at k=3 through density arguments.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1112 asks whether k-fold sumsets with bounded gaps can avoid arbitrarily lacunary sequences. The answer reveals a fundamental phase transition: for k=2, avoidance is always possible with r=2; for k=3, avoidance is impossible regardless of the lacunary growth rate. The general characterization for k ≥ 3 remains an open problem in additive combinatorics.",
    "implications": "**Implications for Additive Combinatorics**\n\n1. **Sumset Density:** The problem highlights how k-fold sumsets grow in \"effective density\" - 2A is sparse enough to weave around lacunary sequences, but 3A is not.\n\n2. **Structural Limits:** No matter how carefully one constructs A or how sparse B is, the combinatorial structure of 3-fold sums guarantees intersection.\n\n3. **Open Territory:** The complete landscape for k ≥ 3 and various (d₁, d₂) remains largely unexplored.",
