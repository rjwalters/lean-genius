Can the edges of $G$ always be directed such that there is no directed cycle, and reversing the direction of any edge also creates no directed cycle?\n\n\n\nIn \\cite{Er71} Erd\\H{o}s credits this problem to Ore, who gave an example of a graph without this property which has girth $4$. Gallai noted that the Gr\\\"{otzsch graph} also lacks this property.\n\nThis is false - Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{NeRo78b} proved that, for every integer $g$, there is a graph $G$ with girth $g$ such that every orientation of the edges in $G$ contains a directed cycle or a cycle obtained from a directed cycle by reversing one directed edge.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er71] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some unsolved problems in graph theory and combinatorial analysis.
