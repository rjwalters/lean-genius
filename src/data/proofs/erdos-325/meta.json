  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #325 concerns the density of integers that can be written as sums of three k-th powers. This is a natural extension of the classical Waring problem, which asks how many k-th powers are needed to represent ALL integers.\n\nFor sums of TWO k-th powers, Mahler and Erdős proved in 1938 that the count f_{k,2}(x) of such integers up to x satisfies f_{k,2}(x) ≫ x^{2/k}. The expected density for j terms is x^{j/k} (heuristically, there are about x^{1/k} k-th powers up to x, so about x^{j/k} ways to sum j of them).\n\nFor THREE k-th powers, the conjecture f_{k,3}(x) ≫ x^{3/k} remains open. The best known result for k=3 (cubes) is due to Wooley (2015): f_{3,3}(x) ≫ x^{0.917}, which falls short of the conjectured x^1.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $k \\geq 3$ and let $f_{k,3}(x)$ denote the number of integers $\\leq x$ which can be written as sums of three nonnegative $k$-th powers. Is it true that\n$$f_{k,3}(x) \\gg x^{3/k}?$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN — The main conjecture is unresolved.\n\n**Best Known**: For $k=3$, Wooley proved $f_{3,3}(x) \\gg x^{0.917}$ (2015).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem using Mathlib's asymptotic notation:\n\n1. **Core Definitions**: Define `IsSumThreePower k n` as the predicate for n being a sum of three k-th powers, and `cardIsSumThreePowerBelow k x` as the counting function f_{k,3}(x).\n\n2. **Examples**: Verify concrete cases like 0 = 0^k + 0^k + 0^k and 3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 1^3.\n\n3. **Main Conjecture**: State as an axiom that x^{3/k} = O(f_{k,3}(x)) in the `atTop` filter.\n\n4. **Partial Results**: Include Wooley's theorem for k=3 and the Mahler-Erdős theorem for two terms as context.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Waring's problem connection**: Every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most g(k) k-th powers. Problem #325 asks about the density of those representable by exactly 3.",
      "**The 3/k exponent**: Heuristically, there are ~x^{1/k} k-th powers up to x, so ~x^{3/k} potential sums of three. The conjecture says this heuristic is correct up to a constant.",
      "**Wooley's gap**: For cubes (k=3), the conjecture predicts x^1 but Wooley only achieved x^{0.917}. Closing this gap is a major open problem.",
      "**Two vs three terms**: The two-term case f_{k,2}(x) ≫ x^{2/k} was proved in 1938. Three terms is significantly harder.",
      "**Asymptotic notation**: We use Mathlib's `IsBigO` to express f ≫ g as 'g = O(f)', meaning f grows at least as fast as g."

    "implications": "This problem lies at the intersection of additive number theory and analytic methods. A proof would establish that sums of three powers have the 'expected' density, with implications for understanding the structure of power sums. Progress here often involves the Hardy-Littlewood circle method and mean value estimates.",
