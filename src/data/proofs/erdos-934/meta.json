    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #934** was posed by Erdős and Nešetřil, studying edge separation in bounded-degree graphs.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- **1983 (Bermond-Bond-Paoli-Peyrat):** Conjectured h_2(d) ≤ 5d²/4 + 1, with equality for even d.\n- **1988 (Erdős):** Wrote 'This problem seems interesting only if there is a nice expression for h_t(d).'\n- **1990 (Chung-Gyárfás-Tuza-Trotter):** Proved h_2(d) = ⌊5d²/4⌋ + 1 exactly.\n- **2022 (Cambie et al.):** Proved h_3(3) = 23, conjectured h_3(d) ≤ d³-d²+d+2, and established general bounds.\n\nThe problem connects to 2K₂-free graphs and line graph diameter problems.",

General bounds show h_t(d) = Θ(d^t) with coefficient approaching 1.",
