Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er88} wrote 'This problem seems to be interesting only if there is a nice expression for $h_t(d)$.'\n\nIt is easy to see that $h_t(d)\\leq 2d^t$ always and $h_1(d)=d+1$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and Bermond, Bond, Paoli, and Peyrat \\cite{BBPP83} independently conjectured that $h_2(d) \\leq \\tfrac{5}{4}d^2+1$, with equality for even $d$ (see [149]). This was proved by Chung, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Tuza, and Trotter \\cite{CGTT90}.\n\nCambie, Cames van Batenburg, de Joannis de Verclos, and Kang \\cite{CCJK22} conjectured that\\[h_3(d) \\leq d^3-d^2+d+2,\\]with equality if and only if $d=p^k+1$ for some prime power $p^k$, and proved that $h_3(3)=23$. They also conjecture that, for all $t\\geq 3$, $h_t(d)\\geq (1-o(1))d^t$ for infinitely many $d$ and $h_t(d)\\leq (1+o(1))d^t$ for all $d$ (where the $o(1)$ term $\\to 0$ as $d\\to \\infty$).\n\nThe same authors prove that, if $t$ is large, then there are infinitely many $d$ such that $h_t(d) \\geq 0.629^td^t$, and that for all $t\\geq 1$ we have\\[h_t(d) \\leq \\tfrac{3}{2}d^t+1.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BBPP83] Bermond, J.-C. and Bond, J. and Paoli, M. and Peyrat, C., Graphs and interconnection networks: diameter and\nvulnerability.
