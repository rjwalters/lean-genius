Even the existence of $R^*(G)$ is not obvious, but was proved independently by Deuber \\cite{De75}, Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and P\\'{o}sa \\cite{EHP75}, and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{Ro73}.\n\nR\\\"{o}dl \\cite{Ro73} proved this when $G$ is bipartite. Kohayakawa, Pr\\\"{o}mel, and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{KPR98} have proved that\\[R^*(G) < 2^{O(n(\\log n)^2)}.\\]An alternative (and more explicit) proof was given by Fox and Sudakov \\cite{FoSu08}. Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov \\cite{CFS12} have improved this to\\[R^*(G) < 2^{O(n\\log n)}.\\]This is true, and an upper bound of\\[R^*(G) < 2^{O(n)}\\]was proved by Arag\\~{a}o, Campos, Dahia, Filipe, and Marciano \\cite{ACDFM25}.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ACDFM25] L.
