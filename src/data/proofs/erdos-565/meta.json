    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #565: Induced Ramsey Numbers**\n\nThis problem was posed by Erdős and Rödl. Unlike ordinary Ramsey numbers where we seek any monochromatic copy, induced Ramsey numbers require finding monochromatic INDUCED subgraphs - a much harder constraint.\n\n**Historical Progress:**\n- **1973:** Rödl proved exponential bounds for bipartite graphs\n- **1975:** Existence proved independently by Deuber, and Erdős-Hajnal-Pósa\n- **1998:** Kohayakawa-Prömel-Rödl: 2^{O(n(log n)²)}\n- **2008:** Fox-Sudakov: Alternative proof\n- **2012:** Conlon-Fox-Sudakov: 2^{O(n log n)}\n- **2025:** Aragão et al.: 2^{O(n)} - SOLVES the problem!",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet R*(G) be the induced Ramsey number: the minimal m such that there exists a graph H on m vertices where any 2-coloring of H's edges contains a monochromatic induced copy of G.\n\n**Question:** Is R*(G) ≤ 2^{O(n)} for all graphs G on n vertices?\n\n**Solution (Aragão et al. 2025):**\nYES! There exists a constant C > 0 such that R*(G) ≤ 2^{Cn} for all n-vertex graphs G.\n\nThis resolves a long-standing conjecture with a 50+ year history.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Setup:** Define simple graphs using Mathlib's SimpleGraph.\n\n2. **Induced Subgraphs:** Formalize when H contains an induced copy of G.\n\n3. **Edge Colorings:** Define 2-colorings and monochromatic structures.\n\n4. **Induced Ramsey Number:** Define R*(G) as an infimum.\n\n5. **Existence:** Axiomatize that R*(G) is finite for all G.\n\n6. **Historical Bounds:** State progressively improving bounds.\n\n7. **Main Theorem:** The Aragão et al. 2^{O(n)} upper bound.\n\n8. **Tightness:** Show matching exponential lower bounds exist.",

      "**Induced vs Ordinary:** R*(G) requires monochromatic INDUCED copies - much harder than ordinary Ramsey",
      "**Non-trivial Existence:** Even showing R*(G) is finite was a major result (1973-75)",
      "**50+ Year Problem:** From existence to optimal bounds took over 50 years",
      "**Progressive Improvements:** 2^{O(n(log n)²)} → 2^{O(n log n)} → 2^{O(n)}",
      "**Tightness:** The 2^{O(n)} bound is essentially optimal - matching lower bounds exist",
      "**Probabilistic Methods:** Modern proofs use sophisticated probabilistic techniques",

After 50+ years of progress - from proving existence to successive improvements - Aragão, Campos, Dahia, Filipe, and Marciano (2025) achieved the optimal exponential bound, resolving the problem completely.",
