    "content": "Gödel's 1931 paper is one of the most important in the history of mathematics and logic. It proved that Hilbert's dream of a complete, consistent formal foundation for mathematics was impossible.\n\nThe theorem states that any formal system $F$ capable of expressing basic arithmetic must be **incomplete**: there exist true statements that $F$ cannot prove. This isn't a flaw in our axioms—it's a fundamental limitation of formal reasoning itself.\n\nThis formalization presents the key conceptual components. A complete proof would require thousands of lines defining syntax, proof systems, and primitive recursive functions.",
