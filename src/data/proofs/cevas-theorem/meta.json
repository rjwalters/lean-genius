    "historicalContext": "Ceva's Theorem was published by Italian mathematician Giovanni Ceva in 1678 in his work 'De lineis rectis se invicem secantibus statica constructio' (On straight lines intersecting each other in a static construction). The theorem is closely related to Menelaus's theorem (which deals with collinear points rather than concurrent lines) and both are fundamental results in triangle geometry.\n\nThe theorem provides a unified framework for understanding classical concurrence results including medians meeting at the centroid, altitudes meeting at the orthocenter, and angle bisectors meeting at the incenter.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem (Ceva):** Let ABC be a triangle with points D, E, F on sides BC, CA, AB respectively. The cevians AD, BE, CF are concurrent if and only if:\n\n$$(\\frac{AF}{FB}) \\cdot (\\frac{BD}{DC}) \\cdot (\\frac{CE}{EA}) = 1$$\n\nwhere the ratios are signed (positive for internal division, negative for external division).\n\n**Algebraic Form:** If D = (1-d)B + dC, E = (1-e)C + eA, F = (1-f)A + fB, then concurrency holds iff:\n$$d \\cdot e \\cdot f = (1-d) \\cdot (1-e) \\cdot (1-f)$$",
    "proofStrategy": "Our proof uses a direct algebraic approach with signed ratios:\n\n1. **Signed Ratios:** Define the signed ratio for a point P dividing AB such that P = (1-t)A + tB as t/(1-t)\n\n2. **Cevian Configuration:** Model the configuration with parameters d, e, f for points on BC, CA, AB\n\n3. **Product Equivalence:** Show that the product of signed ratios equals 1 if and only if d*e*f = (1-d)*(1-e)*(1-f)\n\n4. **Special Cases:** Verify for medians (d = e = f = 1/2) and prove equal parameters only work at 1/2",

      "The product of signed ratios captures the geometric constraint of concurrent cevians algebraically",
      "The parameter condition d*e*f = (1-d)*(1-e)*(1-f) is symmetric and elegant",
      "For equal parameters d = e = f = t, the only solution is t = 1/2 (medians)",
      "Menelaus's theorem is the dual: product = -1 for collinear points on a transversal",
      "The theorem generalizes to higher dimensions and projective geometry"
