Is $\\delta_1(n,m)$ unimodular for $m>n+1$ (i.e. increases until some $m$ then decreases thereafter)? For fixed $n$, where does $\\delta_1(n,m)$ achieve its maximum?\n\n\n\nThis was asked by Erd\\H{o}s in 1986 at Oberwolfach.\n\nErd\\H{o}s proved that\\[\\delta_1(n,m) \\ll \\frac{1}{(\\log n)^c}\\]for all $m$, for some constant $c>0$. Sharper bounds (for various ranges of $n$ and $m$) were given by Ford \\cite{Fo08}.\n\nCambie has calculated that unimodularity fails even for $n=2$ and $n=3$. For example,\\[\\delta_1(3,6)= 0.35\\quad \\delta_1(3,7)\\approx 0.33\\quad \\delta_1(3,8)\\approx 0.3619.\\]Furthermore, Cambie \\cite{Ca25} has shown that, for fixed $n$, the sequence $\\delta_1(n,m)$ has superpolynomially many local maxima $m$.\n\nSee also [446].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ca25] S.
