  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether sum-free subsets of ℝ always leave enough room in their complement for a continuum-sized set whose sumset also avoids S. The Sidon variant was proved by Yael Dillies using a technique discovered by AlphaProof, splitting into cases based on whether |S| < 𝔠 or |S| = 𝔠. The general sum-free case remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let S ⊆ ℝ be sum-free (∀ a,b ∈ S, a+b ∉ S). Must there exist A ⊆ ℝ\\S with |A| = 𝔠 and A+A ⊆ ℝ\\S?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsSumFreeSet, IsSidonReal, and realSumset. ErdosProblem949 states the conjecture using Cardinal.continuum. The solved Sidon variant is axiomatized with its two-case proof strategy (small S uses Zorn's lemma; continuum-sized S uses the shift construction). The general case is left open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Sum-free means (S+S) ∩ S = ∅; the question is about the complement's additive structure",
      "For Sidon sets, the sum function's injectivity is key to the proof",
      "Small case (|S| < 𝔠): Zorn's lemma yields a maximal A; maximality forces |A| = 𝔠",
      "Continuum case (|S| = 𝔠): shift construction A = ((S\\{a}) - a/2) \\ S works"
