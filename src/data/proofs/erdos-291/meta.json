There is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition: a prime $p\\leq n$ divides $(a_n,L_n)$ if and only if $p$ divides the numerator of $1+\\cdots+\\frac{1}{k}$, where $k$ is the leading digit of $n$ in base $p$. This can be seen by writing\\[a_n = \\frac{L_n}{1}+\\cdots+\\frac{L_n}{n}\\]and observing that the right-hand side is congruent to $1+\\cdots+1/k$ modulo $p$. (The previous claim about $p-1$ follows immediately from Wolstenholme's theorem.)\n\nThis leads to a heuristic prediction (see for example a preprint of Shiu \\cite{Sh16}) of $\\asymp\\frac{x}{\\log x}$ for the number of $n\\in [1,x]$ such that $(a_n,L_n)=1$. In particular, there should be infinitely many $n$, but the set of such $n$ should have density zero. Unfortunately this heuristic is difficult to turn into a proof.\n\nWu and Yan \\cite{WuYa22} have proved, conditional on $\\frac{1}{\\log p}$ being linearly independent over $\\mathbb{Q}$ for any finite collection of primes $p$ (itself a consequence of Schanuel's conjecture), that the set of $n$ for which $(a_n,L_n)>1$ has upper density $1$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Sh16] P.
