    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #833: Vertex Degrees in 3-Chromatic Hypergraphs**\n\nThis problem concerns the minimum vertex degree in hypergraphs with chromatic number exactly 3. A hypergraph H = (V, E) is r-uniform if every edge contains exactly r vertices. The chromatic number χ(H) is the minimum number of colors needed to color vertices so no edge is monochromatic.\n\n**The Question (Erdős):** Let f(r) be the largest integer such that every r-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraph has a vertex contained in at least f(r) edges. Does f(r) grow exponentially? Specifically, is there c > 0 such that f(r) ≥ (1+c)^r for all r ≥ 2?\n\n**Background:**\n- f(2) = 2 (the triangle is the minimal 3-chromatic graph)\n- f(3) = 3 (achieved by the Fano plane)\n- Erdős did not know f(4)\n\n**The Solution (Erdős-Lovász 1975):** YES! Every r-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraph has a vertex in at least 2^{r-1}/(4r) edges. This grows like (√2)^r, confirming exponential growth with c ≈ 0.414.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet $f(r)$ = largest integer such that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with $\\chi(H) = 3$ has a vertex in at least $f(r)$ edges.\n\n**Question:** Does there exist $c > 0$ such that $f(r) \\geq (1+c)^r$ for all $r \\geq 2$?\n\n**Answer (Erdős-Lovász 1975):** YES!\n\nEvery $r$-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraph has a vertex in at least $\\frac{2^{r-1}}{4r}$ edges.\n\nSince $\\frac{2^{r-1}}{4r} \\sim \\frac{(\\sqrt{2})^r}{4r}$, this grows exponentially with base $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$.",
