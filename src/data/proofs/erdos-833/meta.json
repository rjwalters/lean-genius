It is easy to see that $f(2)=2$ and $f(3)=3$. Erd\\H{o}s did not know the value of $f(4)$.\n\nThis was solved by Erd\\H{o}s and Lov\\'{a}sz \\cite{ErLo75}, who proved in particular that there is a vertex contained in at least\\[\\frac{2^{r-1}}{4r}\\]many edges.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErLo75] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Lov\\'{a}sz, L., Problems and results on {$3$}-chromatic hypergraphs and some\nrelated questions.
