Is $G$ the union of at most $\\tfrac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$ sets of strongly independent edges (sets such that the induced subgraph is the union of vertex-disjoint edges)?\n\n\n\nAsked by Erd\\H{o}s and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il in 1985 (see \\cite{FGST89}). This is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the square of the line graph $L(G)^2$ is at most $\\frac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$.\n\nThis bound would be the best possible, as witnessed by a blowup of $C_5$. The minimum number of such sets required is sometimes called the strong chromatic index of $G$.\n\nThe weaker conjecture that there exists some $c>0$ such that $(2-c)\\Delta^2$ sets suffice was proved by Molloy and Reed \\cite{MoRe97}, who proved that $1.998\\Delta^2$ sets suffice (for $\\Delta$ sufficiently large). This was improved to $1.93\\Delta^2$ by Bruhn and Joos \\cite{BrJo18} and to $1.835\\Delta^2$ by Bonamy, Perrett, and Postle \\cite{BPP22}. The best bound currently available is\\[1.772\\Delta^2,\\]proved by Hurley, de Joannis de Verclos, and Kang \\cite{HJK22}. Mahdian has, in their Masters' thesis, proved an upper bound of $(2+o(1))\\frac{\\Delta^2}{\\log \\Delta}$ under the additional assumption that $G$ is $C_4$-free.\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il also asked the easier problem of whether $G$ containing at least $\\tfrac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$ many edges implies $G$ containing two strongly independent edges. This was proved by Chung, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Tuza, and Trotter \\cite{CGTT90}.\n\nIt is still open even whether the clique number of $L(G)^2$ at most $\\frac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$. Let $\\omega=\\omega(L(G)^2)$ be this clique number. \\'{S}leszy\\'{n}ska-Nowak \\cite{Sl15} proved $\\omega \\leq \\frac{3}{2}\\Delta^2$. Faron and Postle \\cite{FaPo19} proved $\\omega\\leq \\frac{4}{3}\\Delta^2$. Cames van Batenburg, Kang, and Pirot \\cite{CKP20} have proved $\\omega\\leq \\frac{5}{4}\\Delta^2$ under the additional assumption that $G$ is triangle-free (and $\\omega\\leq \\Delta^2$ if $G$ is $C_5$-free).\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BPP22] Bonamy, Marthe and Perrett, Thomas and Postle, Luke, Colouring graphs with sparse neighbourhoods: bounds and\napplications.
