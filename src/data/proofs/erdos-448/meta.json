Is it true that, for all $\\epsilon>0$,\\[\\tau^+(n) < \\epsilon \\tau(n)\\]for almost all $n$?\n\n\n\nThis is false, and was disproved by Erd\\H{o}s and Tenenbaum \\cite{ErTe81}, who showed that in fact the upper density of the set of such $n$ is $\\asymp \\epsilon^{1-o(1)}$ (where the $o(1)$ in the exponent $\\to 0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$).\n\nA more precise result was proved by Hall and Tenenbaum \\cite{HaTe88} (see Section 4.6), who showed that the upper density is $\\ll\\epsilon \\log(2/\\epsilon)$. Hall and Tenenbaum further prove that $\\tau^+(n)/\\tau(n)$ has a distribution function.\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s and Graham also asked whether there is a good inequality known for $\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\tau^+(n)$. This was provided by Ford \\cite{Fo08} who proved\\[\\sum_{n\\leq x}\\tau^+(n)\\asymp x\\frac{(\\log x)^{1-\\alpha}}{(\\log\\log x)^{3/2}}\\]where\\[\\alpha=1-\\frac{1+\\log\\log 2}{\\log 2}=0.08607\\cdots.\\]See also [446] and [449].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErTe81] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Tenenbaum, G., Sur la structure de la suite des diviseurs d'un entier.
