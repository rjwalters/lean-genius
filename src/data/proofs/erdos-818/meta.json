  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem is part of the sum-product phenomenon, a central topic in additive combinatorics. Erdős-Szemerédi conjectured that finite sets cannot have both small sumsets AND small product sets. This problem explores a conditional version: if the sumset IS small, how large must the product set be? Solymosi's 2009 paper 'Bounding multiplicative energy by the sumset' resolved this completely.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A be a finite set of integers such that |A+A| ≤ K·|A| for some constant K. Is it true that |A·A| ≥ |A|²/(log|A|)^C for some constant C > 0?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines sumsets, product sets, and the small sumset condition. Solymosi's theorem is stated as the main result, with the proof strategy outlined: bound multiplicative energy from below (Cauchy-Schwarz) and above (Solymosi's lemma), then combine to get the product set bound.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Sets cannot have both strong additive AND multiplicative structure",
      "Small additive doubling forces large multiplicative expansion",
      "The log factor in the denominator is tight (arithmetic progressions show this)",
      "Multiplicative energy is the key intermediate quantity",
      "Solymosi proved C = 1 works, stronger than the original conjecture"
