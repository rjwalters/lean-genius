  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The cochromatic number ζ(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to color vertices so each color class is either a clique or an independent set (a 'homogeneous' set). Erdős and Gimbel posed this problem in 1993, asking whether graphs with high chromatic number must contain subgraphs with high cochromatic number. They proved a weaker bound √(m / log m). The full bound m / log m was proved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov in 1997 using Ramsey-theoretic techniques.",
    "problemStatement": "If G is a graph with chromatic number χ(G) = m, must G contain a subgraph H with ζ(H) ≫ m / log m?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov 1997)\n\nThe bound m / log m is optimal - complete graphs achieve it.",
    "proofStrategy": "The solution uses Ramsey-theoretic methods:\n\n1. **Homogeneous sets from Ramsey theory:** Any graph on n vertices has a homogeneous set (clique or independent set) of size ~ log n.\n\n2. **Recursive decomposition:** Find a large homogeneous set, remove it, and recurse.\n\n3. **The key bound:** The cochromatic number of the subgraph built this way is ≥ cm / log m.\n\n4. **Tightness:** Complete graphs show the bound is best possible.",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #760 is SOLVED. Every graph with chromatic number m contains a subgraph with cochromatic number at least cm / log m for some constant c > 0. This was proved by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (1997), improving Erdős-Gimbel's earlier √(m / log m) bound.",
    "implications": "The result shows a fundamental relationship between chromatic and cochromatic numbers: high chromatic number forces high cochromatic number in some subgraph. The logarithmic loss is unavoidable due to Ramsey-theoretic limitations.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the optimal constant c in ζ(H) ≥ cm / log m?",
      "Can the result be strengthened for special graph classes?",
      "What is the computational complexity of finding the optimal subgraph H?"
