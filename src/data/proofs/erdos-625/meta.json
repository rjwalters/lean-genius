    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #625**\n\nProposed by Erdős and Gimbel at a random graph conference in Poznań, Poland (1989). The cochromatic number generalizes proper coloring by allowing color classes to induce either complete graphs (cliques) or empty graphs (independent sets).\n\n**Prize Structure:**\nErdős offered $100 for a proof that χ - ζ → ∞ almost surely, and $1000 for a proof of the opposite. He later remarked to Gimbel that \"$1000 was perhaps too much\" - suggesting he believed the affirmative answer is correct.\n\n**Recent Progress (2024):**\nHeckel and independently Steiner proved that χ(G) - ζ(G) is unbounded with high probability. Heckel further conjectured χ - ζ ≈ n/(log n)³ and proved χ - ζ ≥ n^{1-ε} for roughly 95% of all n. Despite this progress, the main question remains OPEN.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Open)**\n\nThe cochromatic number ζ(G) is the minimum number of colors needed such that each color class induces either a complete graph or an empty graph.\n\nFor random G(n, 1/2), does χ(G) - ζ(G) → ∞ almost surely as n → ∞?\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- n/(2 log₂ n) ≤ ζ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ (1+o(1))n/(2 log₂ n) a.s.\n- The difference χ - ζ is unbounded (Heckel/Steiner 2024)\n- χ - ζ ≥ n^{1-ε} for ~95% of n\n\n**Prize: $1000 for FALSE, $100 for TRUE**",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Cochromatic Definitions:** IsCochromaticClass, CochromaticColoring, cochromaticNumber\n\n2. **Basic Properties:**\n   - ζ(G) ≤ χ(G) (every proper coloring is cochromatic)\n   - ζ(G) = ζ(Gᶜ) (complement symmetry)\n\n3. **Random Graph Model:**\n   - RandomGraph structure for G(n, p)\n   - AlmostSurely predicate for a.s. properties\n\n4. **Known Bounds:**\n   - Bollobás (1988): χ(G) ≤ (1+o(1))n/(2 log₂ n)\n   - Clique/independence bounds: ω, α ≈ 2 log₂ n\n\n5. **Recent Results:**\n   - Heckel-Steiner unboundedness theorem\n   - Heckel's conjecture and density results\n\n6. **Why Axioms:** The main question is OPEN and requires measure-theoretic probability theory beyond current Mathlib",
