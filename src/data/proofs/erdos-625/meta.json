  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Proposed by Erdős and Gimbel at a random graph conference in Poznań, Poland (1989). The cochromatic number generalizes proper coloring by allowing cliques as well as independent sets as color classes. Recent breakthroughs by Heckel and Steiner (2024) have shown the difference χ - ζ grows unboundedly.",
    "problemStatement": "The cochromatic number ζ(G) is the minimum colors where each class induces a complete or empty graph. For random G(n, 1/2), does χ(G) - ζ(G) → ∞ almost surely? Known: n/(2 log₂ n) ≤ ζ(G) ≤ χ(G) ≤ (1+o(1))n/(2 log₂ n). Heckel conjecture: χ - ζ ≈ n/(log n)³.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize cochromatic colorings, the random graph model G(n, 1/2), Bollobás's bounds, the Heckel-Steiner unboundedness result, Heckel's conjecture, and connections to clique/independence numbers. The formalization includes concentration inequalities and special graph classes.",
