  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #48 asks whether there are infinitely many pairs (n,m) where Euler's totient φ(n) equals the sum of divisors σ(m). This was proved by Ford, Luca, and Pomerance in 2010 using analytic number theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many integers $n, m$ such that $\\varphi(n) = \\sigma(m)$?",
    "proofStrategy": "The proof uses deep results about the distribution of values of arithmetic functions. We formalize the statement and verify concrete examples like φ(5) = σ(3) = 4.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The answer is YES - infinitely many such pairs exist",
      "Example: φ(5) = 4 = σ(3) since divisors of 3 are {1,3}",
      "The full proof requires analytic methods beyond current Mathlib"
