    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #1080**\n\nThis problem explores the threshold for forcing six-cycles in bipartite graphs with an imbalanced partition.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős [Er75]: Posed the problem; noted that C_8 is forced\n- De Caen & Székely [DeSz92]: Disproved the conjecture, established bounds on f(n,m)\n- Faudree & Simonovits: Independently proved the general upper bound\n- Lazebnik, Ustimenko & Woldar [LUW94]: Improved the lower bound using algebraic constructions\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nThe problem concerns bipartite graphs G = (X ∪ Y, E) where |X| = ⌊n^(2/3)⌋ and the total vertex count is n. The question asks whether O(n) edges suffice to guarantee a 6-cycle.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Disproved)**\n\nLet G be a bipartite graph on n vertices where one part has ⌊n^(2/3)⌋ vertices. Does there exist a constant c > 0 such that if G has at least cn edges, then G must contain a C_6 (6-cycle)?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\nDe Caen and Székely (1992) showed no such constant exists. The extremal function f(n, ⌊n^(2/3)⌋) for C_4,C_6-free bipartite graphs satisfies:\n- Upper bound: O(n^(10/9))\n- Lower bound: Ω(n^(16/15)) (improved by Lazebnik-Ustimenko-Woldar)\n\nSince f grows superlinearly, no constant c works.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Structures:** Define bipartitions, bipartite graphs, and cycle predicates using Mathlib's SimpleGraph.\n\n2. **Extremal Function:** Define f(n,m) as the maximum edge count in C_4,C_6-free bipartite graphs.\n\n3. **Key Bounds:** Axiomatize De Caen-Székely and Lazebnik-Ustimenko-Woldar bounds.\n\n4. **Disproof:** Show that superlinear growth of f contradicts existence of constant c.\n\n5. **Contrast:** Note that C_8 IS forced by cn edges (Erdős's observation).\n\n6. **Related Results:** Include Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem connection.",

The extremal function f(n, ⌊n^(2/3)⌋) grows superlinearly: between Ω(n^(16/15)) and O(n^(10/9)). However, Erdős observed that C_8 IS guaranteed by O(n) edges.",
