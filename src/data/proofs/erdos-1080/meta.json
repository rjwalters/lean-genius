Is there a constant $c>0$ such that if $G$ has at least $cn$ edges then $G$ must contain a $C_6$?\n\n\n\nErd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er75} says 'it is easy to see that it contains a $C_8$'.\n\nThe answer is no, as shown by De Caen and Sz\\'{e}kely \\cite{DeSz92}, who in fact show a stronger result. Let $f(n,m)$ be the maximum number of edges of a bipartite graph between $n$ and $m$ vertices which does not contain either a $C_4$ or $C_6$. A positive answer to this question would then imply $f(n,\\lfloor n^{2/3}\\rfloor)\\ll n$. De Caen and Sz\\'{e}kely prove\\[n^{10/9}\\gg f(n,\\lfloor n^{2/3}\\rfloor) \\gg n^{58/57+o(1)}\\]for $m\\sim n^{2/3}$. They also prove more generally that, for $n^{1/2}\\leq m\\leq n$,\\[f(n,m) \\ll (nm)^{2/3},\\]which was also proved by Faudree and Simonovits.\n\nLazebnik, Ustimenko, and Woldar \\cite{LUW94} improved the lower bound to\\[f(n,\\lfloor n^{2/3}\\rfloor) \\gg n^{16/15+o(1)}\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[DeSz92] de Caen, D. and Sz\\'{e}kely, L.
