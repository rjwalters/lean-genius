    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #668**\n\nThis problem explores the structure of extremal configurations for the classical unit distance problem in the plane.\n\n**Background:**\nThe unit distance problem (Erdos Problem #90) asks: what is the maximum number u(n) of unit distances among n points in the plane? Problem #668 goes further, asking about the UNIQUENESS of configurations achieving this maximum.\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- The unit distance problem was posed by Erdos in 1946\n- The case n=4 is fully understood: exactly one configuration (the double triangle)\n- Computational work by Engel, Hammond-Lee, Su, Varga, Zsamboki [EHSVZ25] and Alexeev, Mixon, Parshall [AMP25] suggests uniqueness for 5 <= n <= 21\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (OPEN)**\n\nLet u(n) be the maximum number of unit distances among n points in the plane.\nLet f(n) be the number of incongruent point configurations achieving u(n).\n\n**Question 1:** Does f(n) tend to infinity as n grows?\n\n**Question 2:** Is f(n) > 1 for all n > 3?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- f(4) = 1: The unique extremal is two equilateral triangles sharing an edge\n- Computational evidence suggests f(n) = 1 for 5 <= n <= 21\n\n**Note:** The second question as stated is false (f(4) = 1), so the interesting version asks about large n.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Euclidean Setup:** Use Mathlib's EuclideanSpace for the plane R^2\n\n2. **Unit Distances:** Define isUnitPair and count unit pairs in a point set\n\n3. **Extremality:** Define u(n) and isExtremal predicate\n\n4. **Congruence:** Define areCongruent via rigid motions (isometries)\n\n5. **Counting Function:** f(n) as number of congruence classes\n\n6. **Known Results:** Axiomatize f(4) = 1 and the unique double-triangle\n\n7. **Open Questions:** State question_one and question_two formally",
