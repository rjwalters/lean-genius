Are there $k$ consecutive primes in arithmetic progression?\n\n\n\nGreen and Tao \\cite{GrTa08} have proved that there must always exist some $k$ primes in arithmetic progression, but these need not be consecutive. Erd\\H{o}s called this conjecture 'completely hopeless at present'.\n\nThe existence of such progressions for small $k$ has been verified for $k\\leq 10$, see the Wikipedia page. It is open, even for $k=3$, whether there are infinitely many such progressions.\n\nSee also [219].\n\nThis is discussed in problem A6 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[GrTa08] Green, Ben and Tao, Terence, The primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.
