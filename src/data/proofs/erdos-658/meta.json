Is it true that if $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}^2$ has $\\lvert A\\rvert \\geq \\delta N^2$ then $A$ must contain the vertices of a square?\n\n\n\nA problem of Graham, if the square is restricted to be axis-aligned. (It is unclear whether in \\cite{Er97e} had this restriction in mind.)\n\nThis qualitative statement follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem proved by Furstenberg and Katznelson \\cite{FuKa91}. A quantitative proof (yet with very poor bounds) was given by Solymosi \\cite{So04}.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er97e] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some of my favourite unsolved problems. Math. Japon.
