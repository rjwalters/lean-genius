    "historicalContext": "**The R(xᵢ) Function**\\n\\nFor a point set in the plane, R(xᵢ) counts how many distinct distances emanate from point xᵢ to other points. This measures the 'distance complexity' at each point.\\n\\n**Erdős's Original Conjecture**\\n\\nErdős conjectured that R(x₃)/√n → ∞ as n → ∞, meaning even the third-smallest R value should grow faster than √n. This would imply αₖ → ∞ very quickly.\\n\\n**Elekes' Disproof**\\n\\nGyörgy Elekes dramatically disproved Erdős's conjecture using algebraic curve constructions. He showed that for ANY fixed k, there exist point sets where the k-th smallest R value is only O(√n). This means αₖ is finite for all k.\\n\\n**Mathialagan's Resolution (2021)**\\n\\nSahana Mathialagan proved the affirmative answer to the modified question: αₖ → ∞ as k → ∞. Specifically, αₖ ≥ C√k. Her proof uses polynomial partitioning methods from Guth-Katz and sophisticated incidence geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "Let x₁,...,xₙ ∈ ℝ² and let R(xᵢ) = #{|xⱼ - xᵢ| : j ≠ i}. Order points so R(x₁) ≤ ⋯ ≤ R(xₙ). Define αₖ as the minimal constant such that R(xₖ) < αₖ√n is achievable for large n. Is αₖ → ∞ as k → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize point sets, the R function counting distinct distances, and the αₖ constants. Key axioms include Elekes' disproof (αₖ finite), Mathialagan's theorem (αₖ ≥ C√k), and the product bound R(x₁)·R(x₂) ≫ n. The main result combines these to show αₖ → ∞.",
