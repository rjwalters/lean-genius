  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Sylvester's sequence, introduced by James Joseph Sylvester in 1880, is one of the most remarkable integer sequences in mathematics. Starting with 2, each term is computed as sₙ₊₁ = sₙ² - sₙ + 1, giving the sequence 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, ... The terms grow doubly exponentially, yet the sum of reciprocals converges to exactly 1.\n\nThis property makes Sylvester's sequence central to the theory of Egyptian fractions—representations of rationals as sums of distinct unit fractions. The partial sums 1/2, 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6, 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 = 41/42, etc., approach 1 faster than any other unit fraction series.\n\nErdős and Straus (1964) began investigating what makes Sylvester's sequence special. They proved partial results about sequences with similar growth rates. Badea (1993) showed that sequences summing to rationals with sufficiently fast growth must eventually follow the Sylvester recurrence. Problem #243 asks whether the specific growth condition aₙ/aₙ₋₁² → 1 combined with rational sum is enough to force Sylvester behavior.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots$ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}^2} = 1$$\nand $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{a_n} \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Conjecture**: For all sufficiently large $n$,\n$$a_n = a_{n-1}^2 - a_{n-1} + 1$$\n\n**Status**: OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the conjecture precisely using Mathlib's filter framework for limits. The main components are:\n\n1. **Sylvester's sequence** is defined recursively and we verify its first values computationally\n\n2. **The growth predicate** `HasSylvesterGrowth` captures lim aₙ₊₁/aₙ² = 1 using `Filter.Tendsto`\n\n3. **The rationality predicate** `HasRationalReciprocalSum` states the partial sums converge to some q ∈ ℚ\n\n4. **The conclusion** `EventuallySylvester` uses `∀ᶠ n in atTop` to express 'eventually'\n\nThe main conjecture is stated as an axiom since no proof is known. We also state as an axiom that Sylvester's sequence sums to 1, since proving this requires establishing the doubly exponential growth bound.",

      "**Sylvester's sequence**: 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ... defined by sₙ₊₁ = sₙ² - sₙ + 1. Grows doubly exponentially: sₙ ≈ 1.264^(2^n).",
      "**Sum of reciprocals equals 1**: The remarkable identity 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + ... = 1 follows from 1/sₙ = 1/(sₙ-1) - 1/(sₙ₊₁-1), a telescoping series.",
      "**Egyptian fraction connection**: Every rational has infinitely many Egyptian fraction representations. Sylvester's sequence gives the 'greedy' expansion of 1.",
      "**The conjecture's depth**: It claims Sylvester's sequence is essentially UNIQUE among sequences with quadratic-type growth and rational reciprocal sum.",
      "**Partial results exist**: Erdős-Straus (1964) and Badea (1993) proved related characterizations, but this specific formulation remains open."
