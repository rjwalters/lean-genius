The upper bound was proved by Erd\\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp \\cite{EFRS78b} and Ne\\v{s}et\\v{r}il and R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{NeRo78}.\n\nConlon, Fox, and Wigderson \\cite{CFW23} have proved that, for any $s\\leq t$,\\[\\hat{R}(K_{s,t})\\gg s^{2-\\frac{s}{t}}t2^s,\\]and prove that when $t\\gg s\\log s$ we have $\\hat{R}(K_{s,t})\\asymp s^2t2^s$. They conjecture that this should hold for all $s\\leq t$, and so in particular we should have $\\hat{R}(K_{n,n})\\asymp n^32^n$.\n\nSee also the entry in the graphs problem collection.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFW23] Conlon, David and Fox, Jacob and Wigderson, Yuval, Three early problems on size Ramsey numbers.
