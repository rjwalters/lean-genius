  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**From Ambiguity to AI Breakthrough**\n\nErdos Problem #728 was posed by Erdos, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus in 1975. The original formulation was ambiguous - as written, it had trivial solutions. The AlphaProof team noted solutions with very large values of a and b, and the mathematical community debated the intended constraints.\n\nIn January 2026, after the problem statement was clarified to require a,b ≤ (1-ε)n, Kevin Barreto prompted GPT-5.2 which produced a complete solution. The proof was then formalized in Lean using Aristotle and simplified by Boris Alexeev.\n\n**Why This Matters**: Unlike Erdos #124 (which used known techniques in a novel combination), this solution appears genuinely new. Terence Tao noted it was 'not replicated in existing literature' - the clearest evidence yet that AI can generate original mathematics.\n\n**See Also**: [Erdos Problem #124](https://www.erdosproblems.com/124) was the first AI-autonomous solution (November 2025). Problem #728 represents the next milestone: AI producing novel mathematical content.",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdos Problem #728 (Clarified)**\n\nLet ε > 0 be small and C, C' > 0. Do there exist infinitely many integer triples (a, b, n) such that:\n\n1. **Range constraints**: a ≥ εn and b ≥ εn\n2. **Divisibility**: a! b! | n! (a+b-n)!\n3. **Gap condition**: C log n < a+b-n < C' log n\n\n**Background**: Erdos proved that if a!b! | n! then a+b ≤ n + O(log n). This problem asks whether we can find infinitely many examples achieving this logarithmic gap.\n\n**Answer**: YES - for any 0 < C₁ < C₂, there are infinitely many (a,b,n) with b = n/2, a = n/2 + O(log n), and C₁ log n < a+b-n < C₂ log n.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Probabilistic Method with p-adic Analysis**\n\n1. **Kummer's Theorem**: The p-adic valuation of (n choose k) equals the number of carries when adding k and n-k in base p.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: For the divisibility a!b! | n!(a+b-n)!, we need to control p-adic valuations. The term (a+b-n)! in the denominator eliminates obstacles from small primes.\n\n3. **Concentration Bounds**: Use Chernoff-style estimates to show that 'good' values of m (where the divisibility holds) are plentiful in intervals [M, 2M].\n\n4. **Construction**: Set b = m, n = 2m, a = m + k where k ≈ c log m. Show the divisibility condition is satisfied for most m.\n\n5. **Infinitude**: Since good triples exist in every sufficiently large interval, there are infinitely many solutions.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Kummer's theorem translates factorial divisibility into base-p digit carry counting",
      "The (a+b-n)! term in the denominator is crucial - it cancels problematic small prime contributions",
      "The probabilistic method shows most values work, rather than constructing specific examples",
      "Setting b = n/2 and a close to n/2 optimizes the construction",
      "GPT-5.2 independently identified that 'throwing away k!' was problematic and reformulated the argument"
