  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked about the gap between the most and second-most frequent distances in planar point sets. Clemen, Dumitrescu, and Liu proved the gap can be Ω(n log n) and conjectured n^{1+c/log log n}. For general rank r, they showed Ω(n log n / r).",
    "problemStatement": "Estimate max(f(d₁) - f(d₂)) over all n-point sets in ℝ², where distances are ordered by frequency.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define distFrequency counting unordered pairs at a given distance, distinctDistances, maxFrequency, secondFrequency, and frequencyGap. The main conjecture and stronger variant are stated existentially. The Clemen–Dumitrescu–Liu lower bound is an axiom.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Distance frequency is counted over unordered pairs (divide by 2)",
      "The known lower bound Ω(n log n) uses explicit constructions",
      "The conjectured n^{1+c/log log n} bound is much stronger",
      "General rank-r gap is Ω(n log n / r) for r ≤ log n"
