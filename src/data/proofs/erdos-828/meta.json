  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős and is attributed to Graham. It generalizes classical questions about divisibility relations involving Euler's totient function, including Lehmer's famous conjecture from 1932.",
    "problemStatement": "For any integer a ∈ ℤ, are there infinitely many natural numbers n such that φ(n) | n + a, where φ denotes Euler's totient function?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines the set of n satisfying φ(n) | n + a, examines special cases (a = 0, a = -1), and states the main conjecture. Key results include characterization of a = 0 case and connection to Lehmer's conjecture.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For a = 0: φ(n) | n iff n ≤ 1 or n = 2^a · 3^b (completely characterized)",
      "For a = -1: Lehmer's conjecture - only primes satisfy φ(n) | n-1 for n > 1",
      "φ(n) is always even for n > 2, constraining possible divisibilities",
      "The totient depends on prime factorization in complex ways"

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #828 asks whether for every integer a, there are infinitely many n with φ(n) | n + a. The a = 0 case is solved, a = -1 is Lehmer's conjecture, but the general case remains open.",
    "implications": "A positive answer would reveal deep structure in how the totient function relates to arithmetic progressions. The connection to Lehmer's conjecture makes this particularly interesting.",

      "Are there composite Lehmer numbers (n > 1 with φ(n) | n-1)?",
