Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er76d} proved that this problem would also follow from showing that $P(n(n-1))>4\\log n$.\n\nThe condition $a_1<n-1$ is necessary to rule out the trivial solutions when $n=a_2!\\cdots a_k!$.\n\nSur\\'{a}nyi was the first to conjecture that the only non-trivial solution to $a!b!=n!$ is $6!7!=10!$. More generally, Hickerson (as reported in \\cite{Er76d}) conjectured that the only non-trivial solutions to the equation in the problem statement are\\[9!=2!3!3!7!,\\]\\[10!=6!7!,\\]\\[10!=3!5!7!,\\]and\\[16!=14!5!2!.\\]Luca \\cite{Lu07b} has shown that there are only finitely many solutions, conditional on the ABC conjecture, and proved unconditionally that the number of $n\\leq x$ which admit a non-trivial solution is\\[\\leq \\exp \\bigg(f(x)\\frac{\\log (x)}{\\log\\log (x)}\\bigg)\\]for any function $f(x)$ which tends to infinity.\n\nThis is discussed in problem B23 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04}.\n\nIn the case when $k=2$, Erd\\H{o}s \\cite{Er93} proved that if $n!=a_1!a_2!$ with $n-1>a_1\\geq a_2$ then\\[a_1\\geq n-5\\log\\log n,\\]and says it 'would be nice' to prove $a_1\\geq n-o(\\log\\log n)$. Bhat and Ramachandra \\cite{BhRa10} replace the $5$ with $(1+o(1))\\frac{1}{\\log 2}$, and also prove that the same bound holds for arbitrary $k\\geq 2$.\n\nNumerical investigations on solutions to $n!=a_1!a_2!$ have been carried out by Caldwell \\cite{Ca94} and Habsieger \\cite{Ha}, and it is known that there are no solutions aside from $10!=6!7!$ for $n\\leq 10^{3000}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BhRa10] Bhat, K.
