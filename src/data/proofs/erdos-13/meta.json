  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem explores the interaction between divisibility and additive structure. A set A ⊆ {1,...,N} is 'divisibility-free' if no element divides the sum of two larger elements.\n\nErdős and Sárközy observed that the interval (2N/3, N] satisfies this condition and has size approximately N/3. They conjectured this is optimal.\n\nBedert (2023) proved the conjecture, earning the $100 prize. The proof shows |A| ≤ N/3 + O(1) for any divisibility-free set.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem (Erdős-Sárközy):** Let A ⊆ {1,...,N} such that there are no a,b,c ∈ A with a | (b+c) and a < min(b,c). Is |A| ≤ N/3 + O(1)?\n\n**Answer (Bedert 2023):** YES.\n\n**Optimal construction:** The interval (2N/3, N] achieves size N/3 and is divisibility-free.\n\n**Prize:** $100 (claimed by Bedert)",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. `IsBadTriple a b c`: a | (b+c) and a < min(b,c)\n2. `DivisibilityFree A`: A contains no bad triples\n3. `upperThird N`: the interval (2N/3, N] ∩ ℕ\n\nWe axiomatize:\n- Bedert's theorem: |A| ≤ N/3 + O(1)\n- Upper third is divisibility-free\n- Upper third achieves the bound\n- Generalization to r-sums",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**The upper third is optimal:** Elements in (2N/3, N] cannot form bad triples because if a < b,c and a | (b+c), then b+c ≥ 2a. But in the upper third, b+c > 4N/3 while 2a < 2N, limiting possibilities.",
      "**Connection to sum-free sets:** The upper third is ALSO sum-free (a + b ≠ c for all a,b,c). This is because a + b > 4N/3 > N ≥ c.",
      "**The r-sum generalization:** For no a | (b₁+...+bᵣ) with a < min(bᵢ), conjecture |A| ≤ N/(r+1) + O(1). The r=2 case is Bedert's theorem.",
      "**Why N/3?** Intuitively, elements from all three residue classes mod 3 tend to create bad triples. The upper third essentially uses elements from one 'region'.",
      "**Bedert's breakthrough:** The proof required careful analysis of divisibility constraints and achieved the tight bound with only O(1) error."
