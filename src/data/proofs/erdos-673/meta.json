    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem about the function G(n) = Σ dᵢ/dᵢ₊₁ summing consecutive divisor ratios. The first question (G(n) → ∞ for almost all n) is trivial. Terence Tao established the key bounds. Erdős and Tenenbaum proved G(n)/τ(n) has a continuous distribution function.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 = d₁ < d₂ < ... < d_τ(n) = n be the divisors of n. Define G(n) = Σᵢ dᵢ/dᵢ₊₁. (1) Does G(n) → ∞ for almost all n? (2) Find an asymptotic formula for Σ_{n≤X} G(n).",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize G(n) as a sum over consecutive divisor ratios, establish Tao's bounds (τ(n/m)/m ≤ G(n) ≤ τ(n)), prove asymptotic behavior (average → ∞), and formalize the Erdős-Tenenbaum distribution result.",

    "summary": "This formalization captures Erdős Problem #673 on consecutive divisor ratios. The first question (G(n) → ∞ almost always) is trivial. The key results are Tao's bounds relating G(n) to τ(n), and the Erdős-Tenenbaum theorem that G(n)/τ(n) has a continuous distribution function.",
