  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Carmichael numbers are composite integers that pass the Fermat primality test for all bases—the ultimate pseudoprimes. Korselt (1899) characterized them: n is Carmichael iff n is squarefree and (p-1)|(n-1) for all primes p|n. The smallest is 561 = 3×11×17. Erdős (1956) gave the first non-trivial upper bound. The breakthrough came in 1994 when Alford-Granville-Pomerance proved infinitely many exist.",
    "problemStatement": "Let C(x) count Carmichael numbers in [1,x]. Is it true that C(x) = x^{1-o(1)}? That is, for every ε > 0, is C(x) > x^{1-ε} for sufficiently large x?",
    "proofStrategy": "The upper bound uses sieve methods and the structure of Korselt's criterion. The lower bound constructions find integers n where many primes p have (p-1)|(n-1). The huge gap (exponent 0.34 vs. 1) suggests either the upper or lower bound techniques are far from optimal.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The counting function C(x) for Carmichael numbers satisfies x^{0.3389} < C(x) < x^{1-o(1)} for large x. The conjecture C(x) = x^{1-o(1)} asserts Carmichael numbers are surprisingly dense—their log-density approaches 1. Despite progress from AGP (1994) proving infinitely many exist, the gap between bounds remains huge.",
    "implications": "Understanding Carmichael numbers is crucial for primality testing. If dense (conjecture true), random composites often fool Fermat tests. The Pomerance heuristic suggests the upper bound is close to truth, meaning Carmichael numbers are actually sparse.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Is C(x) = x^{1-o(1)}?",
      "Is Pomerance's heuristic order correct?",
      "Can the lower bound exponent be improved past 0.34?",
      "What is the true density of Carmichael numbers?"
