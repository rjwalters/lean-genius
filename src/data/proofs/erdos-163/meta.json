This is equivalent to showing that if $H$ is the union of $c$ forests then $R(H)\\ll_c n$, and also that if every subgraph has average degree at most $d$ then $R(H)\\ll_d n$. Solved by Lee \\cite{Le16}, who proved that\\[ R(H) \\leq 2^{2^{O(d)}}n.\\]This problem is #9 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.
