  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Burr-Erdős Conjecture was posed by Burr and Erdős in 1975 as Problem #9 in Ramsey Theory. It remained open for 42 years until Choongbum Lee resolved it in 2017 using the regularity method and dependent random choice. The conjecture relates graph degeneracy (a local sparseness condition) to Ramsey numbers.",
    "problemStatement": "For any d ≥ 1, if H is a graph such that every subgraph contains a vertex of degree at most d (i.e., H is d-degenerate), then R(H) ≪_d n, where n is the number of vertices of H.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines d-degeneracy, Ramsey numbers, and states the Burr-Erdős Conjecture in equivalent forms. Lee's theorem is axiomatized: R(H) ≤ 2^{2^{O(d)}} · n. The conjecture is proved from Lee's theorem. Special cases (trees, planar graphs) and the conjectured optimal bound 2^{O(d)} · n are discussed.",
