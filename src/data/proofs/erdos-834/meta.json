One definition in the literature is: a hypergraph is $3$-critical if there is a set of $3$ vertices which intersects every edge, but no such set of size $2$, and yet for any edge $e$ there is a pair of vertices which intersects every edge except $e$. Raphael Steiner observes that a $3$-critical hypergraph in this sense has bounded size, so this problem would be a finite computation, and perhaps is not what they meant.\n\nAn alternative definition is that a hypergraph is $3$-critical if it has chromatic number $3$, but its chromatic number becomes $2$ after deleting any edge or vertex.\n\nIn either case, this has been resolved by Li \\cite{Li25}. In the first formulation, the transversal notion of criticality, Li proves that a $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph must have a vertex of degree $\\leq 6$.\n\nOn the other hand, in the second formulation, the chromatic notion of criticality, Li provides an explicit $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph on $9$ vertices with minimum degree $7$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Li25] R.
