  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980) asked whether 1 can be expressed as a sum of reciprocals drawn from k disjoint, non-adjacent intervals of ℕ for all sufficiently large k. The disjointness and non-adjacency constraints make this non-trivial. Hickerson and Montgomery found 5 intervals summing to 2, demonstrating feasibility for related targets.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize interval blocks with size, disjointness, and non-adjacency constraints, the reciprocal sum, valid decompositions, and the main conjecture. We prove basic properties and state structural observations about interval spreading.",
