    "historicalContext": "A **Sidon set** (or B_2 sequence) is a set of integers where all pairwise sums are distinct. These sets, named after Simon Sidon who studied them in the 1930s, appear throughout additive combinatorics.\n\nErdős Problem #44 asks whether any Sidon set can be extended to achieve near-optimal density. The famous Erdős-Turán conjecture (Problem #28) posits that Sidon sets in [1,N] have at most (1+o(1))sqrt(N) elements, and this problem asks about the reverse: can we always extend a Sidon set to approach this bound?\n\nThis file proves auxiliary undergraduate-level results from the formal-conjectures repository while the main conjecture remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $N \\geq 1$ and $A \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ be a Sidon set. Is it true that, for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, there exist $M = M(\\varepsilon)$ and $B \\subseteq \\{N+1,\\ldots,M\\}$ such that $A \\cup B \\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,M\\}$ is a Sidon set of size at least $(1-\\varepsilon)\\sqrt{M}$?\n\n**Status:** OPEN",
    "proofStrategy": "We prove three auxiliary results:\n\n1. **Concrete example**: Verify {1,2,4,8,13} is Sidon by checking all 15 pairwise sums are distinct.\n\n2. **Upper bound**: Any Sidon set in [1,N] has at most 2sqrt(N) elements. This follows from counting: the sums span [2,2N], and distinctness limits the set size.\n\n3. **Lower bound infrastructure**: Powers of 2 form a Sidon set (by binary uniqueness), providing a construction achieving log(N) elements.\n\nThe main conjecture is stated but marked OPEN.",
