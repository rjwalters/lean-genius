  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The Factor Theorem appears in various forms throughout mathematical history. The modern algebraic formulation emerged in the 17th-18th centuries alongside the development of polynomial algebra. Rene Descartes (1637) and others used these ideas in the study of polynomial equations. The theorem is fundamental to polynomial factorization and the fundamental theorem of algebra.\n\nThe Remainder Theorem is closely related - it says that polynomial long division by a linear term always yields a constant remainder equal to the polynomial's value at the root of that linear term.",
    "problemStatement": "**Factor Theorem (Wiedijk #89)**: A polynomial p(x) has (x - a) as a factor if and only if p(a) = 0.\n\n$$(X - a) \\mid p(X) \\iff p(a) = 0$$\n\n**Remainder Theorem**: When a polynomial p(x) is divided by (x - a), the remainder is p(a).\n\n$$p(X) = (X - a) \\cdot q(X) + p(a)$$\n\nEquivalently: p(X) mod (X - a) = p(a) as a constant polynomial.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Factor Theorem:**\nThe forward direction follows from the division algorithm: if (X - a) divides p, then p = (X - a) * q for some q. Evaluating at a gives p(a) = 0 * q(a) = 0.\n\nThe reverse direction: if p(a) = 0, the remainder theorem says p mod (X - a) = p(a) = 0, so (X - a) divides p exactly.\n\n**Remainder Theorem:**\nBy the division algorithm for polynomials, p = (X - a) * q + r where r has degree less than 1, so r is a constant. Evaluating at a: p(a) = 0 * q(a) + r = r.",
