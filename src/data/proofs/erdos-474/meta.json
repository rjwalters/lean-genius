    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #474: Coloring ℝ² for Uncountable Sets**\n\nA foundational problem in infinite Ramsey theory posed by Erdős in 1954.\n\n**Key History:**\n- 1954: Erdős posed the problem, offered $100\n- Sierpinski, Kurepa: Proved the 2-color case always works\n- Erdős: Proved 3-color case under Continuum Hypothesis\n- Shelah: Showed negative answer consistent with ZFC (with large c)\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nIn partition calculus notation, the question is: When does 2^ℵ₀ → (ℵ₁)³₂ hold? This asks whether any 3-coloring of pairs from the continuum has an uncountable monochromatic set.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Resolved)**\n\nUnder what set-theoretic assumptions is it true that $\\mathbb{R}^2$ can be 3-colored such that, for every uncountable $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^2$, the set $A^2$ contains a pair of each color?\n\n**Known Results:**\n- 2 colors: ALWAYS works (Sierpinski-Kurepa)\n- 3 colors + CH: WORKS (Erdős)\n- 3 colors + large c: FAILS (Shelah consistency)\n- 3 colors + c = ℵ₂: OPEN\n\n**Prize:** $100 for deciding without CH",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Cardinal Setup:** Define continuum c, ℵ₁, ℵ₂ using Mathlib's Cardinal type.\n\n2. **Coloring:** ThreeColoring as functions to Fin 3.\n\n3. **Uncountable Sets:** IsUncountable predicate using cardinal comparison.\n\n4. **Main Property:** ContainsAllColorPairs captures when A² has all colors.\n\n5. **Partition Notation:** PartitionProperty formalizes 2^ℵ₀ → (ℵ₁)³₂.\n\n6. **Key Results:** Axiomatize Sierpinski-Kurepa (2-color), Erdős under CH, Shelah consistency.\n\n7. **Open Question:** State that c = ℵ₂ case remains unresolved.",
