Sierpinski and Kurepa independently proved that this is true for $2$-colours. Erd\\H{o}s proved that this is true under the continuum hypothesis that $\\mathfrak{c}=\\aleph_1$, and offered \\$100 for deciding what happens if the continuum hypothesis is not assumed.\n\nShelah proved that it is consistent that the answer is negative, although with a very large value of $\\mathfrak{c}$. It remains open whether it is consistent to have a negative answer assuming $\\mathfrak{c}=\\aleph_2$.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
