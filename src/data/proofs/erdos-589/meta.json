  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks about extracting subsets in general position (no 3 collinear) from sets in almost general position (no 4 collinear). Erdős originally believed linear growth was achievable, but this was disproved.\n\n**Timeline:**\n- **1991 (Füredi)**: Proved g(n) ≥ c·√n·log n and g(n) = o(n)\n- **1991 (Furstenberg-Katznelson)**: Density Hales-Jewett theorem implies o(n) upper bound\n- **2018 (Balogh-Solymosi)**: Proved g(n) ≤ n^(5/6+o(1)) using container method\n\nThe exact order of growth remains open, with a gap between exponents 1/2 and 5/6.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem:** Let g(n) be maximal such that in any set of n points in ℝ² with no four collinear, there exists a subset of g(n) points with no three collinear. Estimate g(n).\n\n**Terminology:**\n- General position = no 3 collinear\n- Almost general position = no 4 collinear\n\n**Erdős's Belief (WRONG):** g(n) = Ω(n)\n\n**Known Bounds:**\n- Lower: g(n) ≥ c·√n·log n (Füredi 1991)\n- Upper: g(n) ≤ n^(5/6+o(1)) (Balogh-Solymosi 2018)\n- Trivial: g(n) ≥ c·√n (greedy algorithm)\n\n**Status:** Partially resolved - bounds established but exact asymptotics unknown.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines collinearity predicates, general and almost general position, and the function g(n). Erdős's false belief is stated and shown to contradict the density Hales-Jewett theorem. Füredi's 1991 bounds and Balogh-Solymosi's 2018 upper bound are axiomatized. The main summary theorem combines all results.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Erdős's linear growth belief was wrong - g(n) = o(n)",
      "Density Hales-Jewett theorem provides the key tool for o(n) upper bound",
      "Balogh-Solymosi used the container method - first application to discrete geometry",

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #589 asks for the guaranteed size of a general position subset extractable from any planar point set with no 4 collinear. Erdős believed linear growth, but this was disproved. Current bounds: n^(1/2)·log n ≤ g(n) ≤ n^(5/6+o(1)). The exact order of growth remains open.",
