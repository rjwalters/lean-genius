  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem asks whether covering systems can avoid even moduli. A covering system is a finite collection of congruence classes that cover all integers. Erdős and Selfridge conjectured that at least one modulus must be even. Related to Problem #2 which bounded the minimum modulus.",
    "problemStatement": "Is there a covering system all of whose moduli are odd? Equivalently, must every covering system have at least one even modulus?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines covering systems via CongruenceClass and CoveringSystem structures, with toSet mapping classes to sets of integers via modular arithmetic. The Erdős-Selfridge conjecture is stated in two equivalent forms. Key partial results are axiomatized: Hough-Nielsen (divisibility by 2 or 3), Balister et al. (no odd squarefree coverings), and LCM constraints.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #7 (Erdős-Selfridge Conjecture), an OPEN problem asking whether there exists a covering system with all moduli odd. The conjecture predicts NO such system exists. Significant partial results are formalized: Hough-Nielsen (2019) proved some modulus must be divisible by 2 or 3, and Balister et al. (2022) ruled out odd squarefree coverings.",
    "implications": "This problem constrains the structure of covering systems. If proven, it would show that the prime 2 plays a special role in coverings. The partial results already severely limit what an odd covering could look like: it must have non-squarefree moduli, the LCM must be divisible by 9 or 15, and some modulus must be divisible by 3.",
