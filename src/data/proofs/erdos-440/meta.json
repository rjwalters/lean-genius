Is it true that $A(x) \\ll x^{1/2}$?\n\nHow large can\\[\\liminf \\frac{A(x)}{x^{1/2}}\\]be?\n\n\n\nTaking $A=\\mathbb{N}$ shows that\\[\\liminf \\frac{A(x)}{x^{1/2}}=1\\]is possible. Erd\\H{o}s and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{ErSz80} proved that it is always $\\leq 1$.\n\nTao in the comments has given a simple proof that $A(x) \\ll x^{1/2}$. van Doorn has proved that $A(x) \\leq (c+o(1))x^{1/2}$ where\\[c=\\sum_{n\\geq 1}\\frac{1}{n^{1/2}(n+1)}\\approx 1.86.\\]This was already proved by Erd\\H{o}s and Szemer\\'{e}di \\cite{ErSz80}, who showed that this constant is the best possible.\n\nThere are more related results (particularly for the more general case of $\\mathrm{lcm}(a_i,a_{i+1},\\ldots,a_{i+k})$) in \\cite{ErSz80}.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErSz80] Erd\\H{o}s, P\\'{a}l and Szemer\\'{e}di, Endre, Remarks on a problem of the American Mathematical Monthly.
