  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originated from the American Mathematical Monthly. Erdős and Szemerédi solved it completely in their 1980 paper in Mat. Lapok. The problem asks about the growth of counting functions for consecutive pairs with bounded LCM. Terence Tao later gave a simple proof of the O(√x) bound in online discussions, and Wouter van Doorn established the sharp constant c ≈ 1.86.",
    "problemStatement": "Let A = {a₁ < a₂ < ...} ⊆ ℕ be an infinite increasing sequence. Let A(x) count the number of indices i for which lcm(aᵢ, aᵢ₊₁) ≤ x. Two questions: (1) Is A(x) = O(x^{1/2})? (2) How large can liminf A(x)/x^{1/2} be?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines increasing sequences, the counting function A(x), and the normalized ratio. Key results: (1) A(x) = O(√x) for any sequence (Tao's elementary proof using divisor bounds), (2) liminf A(x)/√x ≤ 1 always (Erdős-Szemerédi), (3) A = ℕ achieves equality. The sharp bound A(x) ≤ (c + o(1))√x with c ≈ 1.86 is also captured.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For A = ℕ, lcm(n, n+1) = n(n+1) since consecutive integers are coprime",
      "A = ℕ gives liminf A(x)/√x = 1, which is the maximum possible",
      "The bound A(x) = O(√x) follows from divisor function estimates",
      "The optimal constant c = Σ_{n≥1} 1/(√n(n+1)) ≈ 1.86",
      "Generalizes to k-consecutive LCM with different exponents"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #440 is SOLVED. Both questions are answered: (1) YES, A(x) = O(√x) for any infinite sequence, and (2) liminf A(x)/√x ≤ 1 always, with equality achieved by A = ℕ. The sharp bound A(x) ≤ (c + o(1))√x with c ≈ 1.86 is optimal. This is a clean quantitative result in multiplicative number theory connecting LCM constraints with counting functions.",
    "implications": "The problem illustrates the interplay between multiplicative structure (LCM, GCD) and additive counting. The extremality of the natural numbers sequence shows that consecutive coprime pairs maximize the liminf. The techniques extend to k-consecutive LCM bounds with appropriate exponent adjustments.",
