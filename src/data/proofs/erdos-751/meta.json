If $m_1<m_2<\\cdots$ are the lengths of the cycles in $G$ then can $\\min(m_{i+1}-m_i)$ be arbitrarily large? Can this happen if the girth of $G$ is large?\n\n\n\nThe answer is no: Bondy and Vince \\cite{BoVi98} proved that every graph with minimum degree at least $3$ has two cycles whose lengths differ by at most $2$, and hence the same is true for every graph with chromatic number $4$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[BoVi98] Bondy, J. A. and Vince, A., Cycles in a graph whose lengths differ by one or two. J. Graph Theory (1998), 11--15.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
