    "historicalContext": "**Erdos Problem #751: Cycle Lengths in Graphs**\n\nThis problem explores the structure of cycles in graphs with chromatic constraints.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdos posed the question about cycle length gaps in 4-chromatic graphs\n- Bondy and Vince (1998): Proved the key result about minimum degree 3\n- The result is tight: K_4 has cycles of lengths 3 and 4 (gap = 1)\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\n- Chromatic number chi(G) = minimum colors for proper vertex coloring\n- Girth = length of shortest cycle\n- Minimum degree delta(G) = smallest vertex degree\n\n**Key Connection:**\nChromatic number and minimum degree are related: chi(G) >= delta(G)/(delta(G)-1) + 1 implies chi(G) = 4 needs delta(G) >= 3.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet G be a graph with chromatic number chi(G) = 4. If m_1 < m_2 < ... are the lengths of cycles in G, can min(m_{i+1} - m_i) be arbitrarily large? Can this happen if the girth of G is large?\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\nBondy and Vince (1998) proved that every graph with minimum degree >= 3 has two cycles whose lengths differ by at most 2.\n\nSince chi(G) = 4 implies minimum degree >= 3, the answer follows. Large girth doesn't help.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Graph Foundations:** Define minDegree, maxDegree, chromaticNumber, girth, cycleLengths using Mathlib's SimpleGraph.\n\n2. **Key Relationship:** Axiomatize that chi(G) = 4 implies minDegree(G) >= 3.\n\n3. **Bondy-Vince Theorem:** Axiomatize that minDegree >= 3 implies existence of two cycles with length difference <= 2.\n\n4. **Main Results:** Derive that chi(G) = 4 implies close cycles, with or without girth constraints.\n\n5. **Summary:** Combine all results showing the answer is NO.",
