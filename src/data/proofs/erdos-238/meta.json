    "historicalContext": "This problem from Erdős [Er55c, p.7; Er49c] concerns long runs of consecutive primes with uniformly large gaps. The Prime Number Theorem ensures average gaps grow as log(x), so most gaps exceed any fixed constant for large x. The challenge is finding LONG runs where ALL gaps are large.\n\nErdős proved the conjecture holds when c₁ is sufficiently small (depending on c₂). The general case — arbitrary c₁, c₂ > 0 — remains open. Cramér's conjecture on maximal gaps provides supporting context.",
    "problemStatement": "Let c₁, c₂ > 0. Is it true that for any sufficiently large x, there exist more than c₁·log(x) consecutive primes ≤ x such that the difference between any two adjacent primes is > c₂?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines nthPrime, primeGap, consecutivePrimes, and predicates allPrimesLeX and allGapsLarge. The main conjecture uses Filter.Eventually (∀ᶠ in atTop). Erdős's partial result is an axiom. PNT context, run length analysis, and Cramér's conjecture are included. A summary theorem combines the known results.",
