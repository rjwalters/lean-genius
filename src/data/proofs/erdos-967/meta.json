  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem originates from the 1964 paper 'Arithmetical Tauberian Theorems' by Erdős and Ingham. They were interested in conditions under which a functional equation involving a sequence implies asymptotic behavior. The key connection is: if 1 + ∑ₖ 1/aₖ^(1+it) ≠ 0 for all t, then certain Tauberian implications hold.\n\nErdős and Ingham could not decide the conjecture even for the simplest case {2, 3, 5}. The problem remained open for 60 years until Yip's breakthrough in 2025.",
