Is it true that, for every $t\\in \\mathbb{R}$,\\[1+\\sum_{k}\\frac{1}{a_k^{1+it}}\\neq 0?\\]\n\n\n\nA question of Erd\\H{o}s and Ingham \\cite{ErIn64}. The simplest case they could not decide this question for was the finite sequence $\\{2,3,5\\}$.\n\nTheir interest in this problem arose from their proof that the statement that there are no such zeros is equivalent to the fact that, for any non-decreasing $f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ which is bounded on every bounded interval and is $=0$ for $x<1$, the relationship\\[f(x)+\\sum_k f(x/a_k)=\\left(1+\\sum_k \\frac{1}{a_k}+o(1)\\right)x\\]implies $f(x)=(1+o(1))x$.\n\nA related question on MathOverflow concerns the vanishing of $2^{-1-it}+3^{-1-it}+5^{-1-it}$, and GH shows that the Four Exponentials conjecture implies this never vanishes.\n\nYip \\cite{Yi25} has proved that this is not always true - in fact, for any real $t\\neq 0$, there exists a sequence of integers $1<a_1<\\cdots$ such that $\\sum \\frac{1}{a_i}<\\infty$ and $1+\\sum_{k}\\frac{1}{a_k^{1+it}}=0$.\n\nIt remains open whether this is true for every finite sequence of integers.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErIn64] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Ingham, A.
