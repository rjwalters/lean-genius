    "historicalContext": "Moon and Moser (1965) initiated the study of g(n), proving n - log₂n - 2log log n < g(n) ≤ n - ⌊log₂n⌋. Erdős (1966) improved the lower bound to involve log*(n) and conjectured this was tight. Spencer (1971) disproved the conjecture by showing g(n) > n - log₂n - O(1), eliminating the need for log*(n).",
    "problemStatement": "Let g(n) be the maximum number of different sizes of cliques that can occur in a graph on n vertices. Is it true that g(n) = n - log₂n - log*(n) + O(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cliques and the function g(n). Moon-Moser bounds and Erdős's conjecture are stated. Spencer's theorem is axiomatized showing the conjecture is false - the correct asymptotic is g(n) = n - log₂n - Θ(1).",
