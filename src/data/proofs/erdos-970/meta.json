Determine the order of magnitude of $h(k)$. In particular, is it true that\\[h(k) \\ll k^2?\\]\n\n\n\nThat $h(k)\\ll k^2$ is a conjecture of Jacobsthal. Iwaniec \\cite{Iw78} proved\\[h(k) \\ll (k\\log k)^2.\\]The best lower bound known is\\[h(k) \\gg \\frac{(\\log k)(\\log\\log\\log k)}{(\\log\\log k)^2}k,\\]due to Ford, Green, Konyagin, Maynard, and Tao \\cite{FGKMT18}.\n\nThis is a more general form of the function considered in [687].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FGKMT18] Ford, Kevin and Green, Ben and Konyagin, Sergei and Maynard, James and Tao, Terence, Long gaps between primes.
