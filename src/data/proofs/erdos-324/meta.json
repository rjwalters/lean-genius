  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1980) posed this question about polynomials whose pair sums are all distinct. They described it as 'very annoying.' The problem connects to Waring-type questions and the Lander-Parkin-Selfridge conjecture on equal sums of like powers.",
    "problemStatement": "Does there exist a polynomial f(x) ∈ ℤ[x] such that all the sums f(a) + f(b) with a < b nonnegative integers are distinct?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define pairSumFn, orderedPairs, and HasDistinctPairSums using Set.InjOn. ErdosProblem324 asks for existence. The QuinticConjecture (f = x⁵) is stated and shown to imply the main problem. Known failures for n = 2,3,4 (taxicab numbers, Euler) are axiomatized. A minimum degree bound of 5 is included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The conjecture is that f(x) = x⁵ has all pair sums f(a)+f(b) distinct for a < b",
      "For n ≤ 4, xⁿ fails: squares (65 = 1²+8² = 4²+7²), cubes (1729), and fourth powers all have collisions",
      "The Lander-Parkin-Selfridge conjecture implies xⁿ works for all n ≥ 5",
      "Any polynomial with distinct pair sums must have degree ≥ 5"
