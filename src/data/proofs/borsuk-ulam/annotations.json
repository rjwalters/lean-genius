    "content": "The Borsuk-Ulam Theorem states: for any continuous function f: S^n -> R^n, there exist antipodal points x and -x with f(x) = f(-x).\n\nThe intuition is captivating: at any moment, there are two points on opposite sides of Earth with exactly the same temperature AND pressure. You can continuously measure any n quantities on an n-sphere, and somewhere, antipodal points match.\n\nThis 1933 result by Karol Borsuk (answering Stanislaw Ulam's question) became a cornerstone of algebraic topology with surprising applications from graph theory to fair division.\n\nThis formalization presents the conceptual structure. The full proof requires covering space theory, which we axiomatize to focus on the logical flow.",

The covering structure forces h_bar* to be injective\n5. Lift to the universal cover: we get a map S^n -> S^(n-1)\n6. But S^n is simply connected (n >= 2), so this lift is null-homotopic\n7.
