  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem addresses the fundamental question in Ramsey theory: how fast do Ramsey numbers grow? The Erdős-Szekeres bounds from 1935 give k·2^{k/2} ≪ R(k) ≤ C(2k-2,k-1). The lower bound comes from the probabilistic method—one of its first applications. This problem asks whether the lower bound is far from tight.",
    "problemStatement": "If R(k) is the diagonal Ramsey number (minimal n such that every 2-coloring of K_n contains a monochromatic K_k), prove that R(k)/(k·2^{k/2}) → ∞ as k → ∞.",
    "proofStrategy": "The probabilistic method gives R(k) ≥ c·k·2^{k/2} for c ≈ √2/e. The conjecture asserts this is far from tight—R(k) grows faster than any constant times k·2^{k/2}. Proving this would require showing the probabilistic lower bound misses significant structure in Ramsey graphs.",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "The conjecture R(k)/(k·2^{k/2}) → ∞ asks whether diagonal Ramsey numbers grow significantly faster than the probabilistic lower bound. Despite decades of work, neither proof nor disproof exists. The gap between lower bound ~2^{k/2} and upper bound ~4^k remains one of the most important open problems in combinatorics.",
    "implications": "Resolving this would reveal whether random constructions capture the true behavior of Ramsey graphs, or whether there's hidden structure forcing faster growth. It connects to fundamental questions about the power of the probabilistic method.",
