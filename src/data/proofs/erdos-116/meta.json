  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian conjectured that for any monic polynomial of degree n with roots in the closed unit disk, the sublevel set {|p(z)| < 1} has Lebesgue measure at least n^{-O(1)}, or even (log n)^{-O(1)}. Pommerenke first proved c/n⁴, and Krishnapur–Lundberg–Ramachandran achieved the optimal c/log n.",
    "problemStatement": "Is the 2D Lebesgue measure of {z ∈ ℂ : |p(z)| < 1} at least (log n)^{-O(1)} for every monic degree-n polynomial with roots in the unit disk?",
    "proofStrategy": "Defines unit disk polynomials, their sublevel sets, and the associated measure. States Pommerenke's n^{-4} bound, the KLR optimal c/log n lower bound, the KLR C/log log n upper bound, and Pólya's absolute π bound.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The sublevel set {|p(z)| < 1} surrounds each root, and its measure quantifies how 'spread out' the small values are",
      "Pommerenke's bound c/n⁴ was the first polynomial lower bound",
      "KLR's c/log n is nearly tight: the matching upper bound is C/log log n",
      "Pólya showed the maximum measure π is achieved only when all roots coincide"
