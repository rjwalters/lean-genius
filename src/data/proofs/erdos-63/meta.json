It is likely that $2^n$ can be replaced by any sufficiently quickly growing sequence (e.g. the squares).\n\nDavid Penman has observed that this is certainly true if the graph has uncountable chromatic number, since by a result of Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal \\cite{ErHa66} such a graph must contain arbitrarily large finite complete bipartite graphs (see also Theorem 3.17 of Reiher \\cite{Re24}).\n\nZach Hunter has observed that this follows from the work of Liu and Montgomery \\cite{LiMo20}: if $G$ has infinite chromatic number then, for infinitely many $r$, it must contain some finite connected subgraph $G_r$ with chromatic number $r$ (via the de Bruijn-Erd\\H{os theorem} \\cite{dBEr51}). Each $G_r$ contains some subgraph $H_r$ with minimum degree at least $r-1$, and hence via Theorem 1.1 of \\cite{LiMo20} there exists some $\\ell_r\\geq r^{1-o(1)}$ such that $H_r$ contains a cycle of every even length in $[(\\log \\ell)^8,\\ell]$.\n\nSee also [64].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[ErHa66] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A., On chromatic number of graphs and set-systems.
