    "historicalContext": "Conjectured by Mihók and Erdős (1993-1997). Penman observed the result holds for uncountable chromatic number via Erdős-Hajnal. Liu-Montgomery (2020) proved it in full generality using the de Bruijn-Erdős theorem and their result connecting high chromatic number to high minimum degree subgraphs.",
    "problemStatement": "Does every graph with infinite chromatic number contain a cycle of length 2^n for infinitely many n?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines cycle containment, infinite chromatic number, and axiomatizes key theorems: de Bruijn-Erdős (infinite χ implies finite high-χ subgraphs), Liu-Montgomery (high χ implies high minimum degree), Bondy-Simonovits (high degree implies even cycles). The main theorem is axiomatized, with a proved corollary.",

    "summary": "We formalize Erdős Problem #63, which asks whether every graph with infinite chromatic number contains cycles of length 2^n for infinitely many n.
