    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked whether there exists k such that every sufficiently large integer can be written as the sum of a prime and at most k powers of 2. He described the problem as 'probably unattackable' and, with Graham, conjectured that no such k exists. The problem connects to Goldbach-type questions and the study of additive bases formed by primes and lacunary sequences.",
