  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is Problem 4.22 from Halász's collection, attributed to Erdős. Clunie and Netanyahu showed that a path in E from 0 to the unit circle always exists. The question is how long it must be.",
    "problemStatement": "For a monic polynomial f of degree n with roots in the closed unit disk, what is the shortest path in E = {|f(z)| ≤ 1} from z = 0 to |z| = 1?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the unit-rooted polynomial, the sublevel set, and the shortest path length. The main conjecture (divergence with n) and known results are stated as axioms.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For f(z) = z^n, E is the unit disk and path length is 1",
      "Clunie–Netanyahu proved such a path always exists",
      "Erdős conjectured the worst-case path length → ∞ but slowly",
      "E is a lemniscate; root clustering creates thin passages",
      "Connected to Problem #1041 on polynomial sublevel set covering"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #1120 asks for the shortest path in a polynomial sublevel set from the origin to the unit circle. The path length is at least 1 (achieved by z^n), but whether it grows to ∞ with the degree remains open.",
    "implications": "A resolution would illuminate the geometry of polynomial lemniscates and the topology of sublevel sets in complex analysis.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "Does the worst-case path length tend to infinity with n?",
      "What is the growth rate?",
      "Which root configurations produce the longest shortest paths?",
      "Is the path length bounded by a polynomial in n?"
