    "historicalContext": "Erdős Problem #384 concerns prime divisors of binomial coefficients. Conjectured by Erdős and Selfridge in the 1960s, proved by Ecklund in 1969. The unique exception C(7,3) = 35 = 5 × 7 is the only case where all prime factors are ≥ n/2. Stronger conjectures about n/k bounds remain partially open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let 1 < k < n−1. Is C(n,k) divisible by a prime p < n/2? Answer: YES, with exactly one exception: C(7,3) = 35 = 5 × 7. Status: SOLVED by Ecklund (1969).",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines hasSmallPrimeDivisor and isException predicates. The main theorem (ecklund_1969) is an axiom. The exception C(7,3) is formally verified: choose_7_3 = 35 (native_decide), choose_7_3_no_small_prime (interval_cases). Edge cases k=1, k=n−1 are proved. Small cases C(5,2), C(6,2), C(6,3) are verified with concrete examples. Stronger conjectures (Ecklund, Selfridge) are defined.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "C(7,3) = 35 = 5 × 7 is the only exception: both primes are ≥ n/2 = 3.5",
      "A prime p > n/2 can divide C(n,k) at most once, so having TWO such primes is rare",
      "Kummer's theorem: exponent of p in C(n,k) = carries when adding k and n−k in base p",
      "C(2n,n) always has a prime in (n, 2n] by Bertrand's postulate",
      "Stronger bound n/k is conjectured (Ecklund) but only partially proved"
