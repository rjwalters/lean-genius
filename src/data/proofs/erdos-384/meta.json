Proved by Ecklund \\cite{Ec69}, who made the stronger conjecture that whenever $n>k^2$ the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is divisible by a prime $p<n/k$. They have proved the weaker inequality $p\\ll n/k^c$ for some constant $c>0$.\n\nDiscussed in problem B31 and B33 of Guy's collection \\cite{Gu04} - there Guy credits Selfridge with the conjecture that if $n> 17.125k$ then $\\binom{n}{k}$ has a prime factor $p\\leq n/k$.\n\nStronger forms of this conjecture are [1094] and [1095].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Ec69] Ecklund, Jr., E.
