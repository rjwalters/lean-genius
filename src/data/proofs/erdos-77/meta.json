  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This is one of the most famous problems in Ramsey theory. Erdos introduced the probabilistic method in 1947 by proving R(k) >= 2^{k/2}. The upper bound R(k) <= 4^{k-1} from the Erdos-Szekeres recurrence stood for ~90 years until Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe (2023) proved R(k) <= (4 - 1/128)^k, later improved to (3.7993)^k by Gupta et al. (2024).\n\nErdos offered $100 for proving the limit exists and $10000 for proving it doesn't (calling this 'a joke' since he believed it exists). He suspected the limit might be 2 but said 'we have no real evidence for this.'",
    "problemStatement": "**Erdos Problem #77 (OPEN)**\n\nFind $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} R(k)^{1/k}$ where $R(k)$ is the diagonal Ramsey number - the minimum $n$ such that every 2-coloring of $K_n$ contains a monochromatic $K_k$.\n\n**Known bounds**:\n$$\\sqrt{2} \\leq \\liminf R(k)^{1/k} \\leq \\limsup R(k)^{1/k} \\leq 3.7993$$\n\n**Open questions**:\n1. Does the limit exist? ($100 prize)\n2. If so, what is its value? (Erdos suspected 2)\n\n**Small values**: R(3)=6, R(4)=18, 43 <= R(5) <= 48",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the Ramsey number growth rate problem:\n\n1. **Ramsey Numbers**: Axiomatize R(k) with known small values\n2. **Classical Bounds**: Erdos lower (2^{k/2}) and upper (4^{k-1}) bounds\n3. **Growth Rate**: Define ramseyGrowthRate(k) = R(k)^{1/k}\n4. **Liminf/Limsup Bounds**: sqrt(2) <= liminf, limsup <= 4\n5. **2023-2024 Breakthroughs**: CGMS and GNNW improved upper bounds\n6. **Verified Theorems**: erdos_bounds, current_best_bounds, erdos_upper_bound'\n7. **Open Questions**: LimitExists, ErdosConjecture formalized",
    "keyInsights": [
      "**Probabilistic method origin**: Erdos's 1947 lower bound R(k) >= 2^{k/2} was one of the first uses of this revolutionary technique.",
      "**90-year breakthrough**: The upper bound of 4 from the 1930s was only improved in 2023 by CGMS.",
      "**Computational intractability**: Even R(5) is unknown exactly - Erdos's 'alien parable' captures this.",
      "**Prize structure**: $100 for existence, $10000 for non-existence shows Erdos's belief the limit exists.",
      "**Current gap**: [sqrt(2), 3.7993] ~ [1.414, 3.799] - significant uncertainty remains."
