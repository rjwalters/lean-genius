  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the geometry of triangle dissections. Every triangle can be dissected into n² congruent triangles (by subdividing in a grid pattern), but some triangles can ONLY be dissected into square numbers of pieces.\n\nSoifer showed that triangles with sides √2, √3, √4 have this restrictive property. The problem asks for a complete classification of such 'square-only' triangles. It remains OPEN with a $25 prize.",
    "problemStatement": "**Classification Problem:**\n\nCharacterize all triangles T such that: if T can be dissected into n congruent triangles, then n must be a perfect square.\n\n**Known:**\n- Every triangle can be dissected into n² copies (for any n ≥ 1)\n- The triangle with sides √2, √3, √4 can ONLY be dissected into square counts\n- Triangles with 'integrally independent' angles have this property\n\n**Unknown:**\n- Complete characterization of square-only triangles",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization:\n\n1. Defines `Triangle` structure with side lengths and triangle inequality\n2. Defines `CongruentDissection T S n` for n congruent copies of S tiling T\n3. Defines `HasSquareOnlyProperty T` — only square dissection counts\n4. Proves `universal_square_dissection`: n² always works\n5. Constructs `soiferTriangle` with sides √2, √3, √4\n6. States the open classification problem",

      "**Universal n² Dissections:** Every triangle can be subdivided into n² congruent copies by a grid construction.",
      "**Soifer's Example:** The triangle (√2, √3, √4) cannot be dissected into any non-square number of congruent pieces.",
      "**Integral Independence:** Triangles whose angles are 'integrally independent' (no integer linear relation) tend to have the square-only property.",
      "**Similar vs Congruent:** For similar (not congruent) dissections, every triangle works for n ≠ 2, 3, 5.",
      "**Open Classification:** The complete characterization remains unknown — worth $25!"
