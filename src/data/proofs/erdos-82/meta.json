  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem was posed by Erdős, Fajtlowicz, and Staton in 1988. It asks whether the function F(n) — the largest guaranteed regular induced subgraph in any n-vertex graph — grows superlogarithmically. The question sits at the intersection of Ramsey theory and structural graph theory.\n\nRamsey theory immediately gives F(n) ≥ c·log(n), since every graph on n vertices contains a clique or independent set of size ≈ (1/2)log₂(n), and both are regular. The 2023 breakthrough by Campos, Griffiths, Morris, and Sahasrabudhe on diagonal Ramsey numbers slightly improves the constant but not the growth rate.\n\nAlon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov (2007) proved the best known upper bound F(n) ≤ C·√n·(log n)^{O(1)} using probabilistic constructions. The enormous gap between log(n) and √n remains one of the major open questions in extremal graph theory.",
    "problemStatement": "Let F(n) denote the largest integer such that every graph on n vertices contains a regular induced subgraph on at least F(n) vertices. Is it true that F(n)/log(n) → ∞ as n → ∞?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines regular graphs, induced subgraphs, and the function F(n) using Lean 4 with Mathlib. Key bounds from Ramsey theory (lower) and Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov (upper) are stated as axioms. The conjecture is formalized using Filter.Tendsto for the limit F(n)/log(n) → ∞, with an equivalent explicit ε-N formulation.",

      "Ramsey theory gives the baseline F(n) ≥ c·log(n) via guaranteed cliques or independent sets",
      "The Alon-Krivelevich-Sudakov upper bound F(n) ≤ C·√n·(log n)^{O(1)} shows F(n) cannot grow polynomially",
      "Regular subgraphs are harder to find than merely bounded-degree subgraphs — all vertices must have the SAME degree",
      "Exact values F(1..15) = 1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5 from OEIS A120414 show slow initial growth",
      "The 2023 Ramsey diagonal improvement marginally improves the lower bound constant but not the growth rate"
