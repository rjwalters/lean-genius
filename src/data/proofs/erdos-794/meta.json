In fact there is a construction of Frankl and F\\\"{u}redi \\cite{FrFu84} showing it must be at least $2/7$, which is the conjectured truth (although Tur\\'{a}n conjectured before \\cite{Er69} that the edge density was $1/4$, and so likely there is simply a typo in this problem's statement).\n\nHarris has provided the following simple counterexample to the problem as stated: the $3$-uniform graph on $\\{1,\\ldots,9\\}$ with $28$ edges, formed by taking $27$ edges by choosing one element each from $\\{1,2,3\\},\\{4,5,6\\},\\{7,8,9\\}$, and then adding the edge $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er69] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some applications of graph theory to number theory.
