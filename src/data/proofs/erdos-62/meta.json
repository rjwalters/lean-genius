  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem sits at the intersection of infinite combinatorics and graph theory. Graphs with uncountable chromatic number (χ = ℵ₁) have rich subgraph structure. Erdős asked whether any two such graphs must share a 'significant' common subgraph—one with chromatic number at least 4 or even ℵ₀. The Erdős-Hajnal-Shelah theorem establishes that all large odd cycles (χ = 3) are common subgraphs, but the gap to χ = 4 remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "If G₁ and G₂ are two graphs with chromatic number ℵ₁, must there exist a graph H with chromatic number 4 (or even ℵ₀) which is a subgraph of both G₁ and G₂?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines infinite graphs, colorings (finite, countable, uncountable), and subgraph embeddings. The main conjecture is stated in two versions: strong (χ = 4) and weak (χ = ℵ₀). The Erdős-Hajnal-Shelah theorem is axiomatized, and we prove that any two graphs with χ = ℵ₁ share odd cycles as common subgraphs (χ = 3).",
