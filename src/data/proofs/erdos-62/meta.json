This was proved by Erd\\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Shelah \\cite{EHS74}. Erd\\H{o}s wrote \\cite{Er87} that 'probably' every graph with chromatic number $\\aleph_1$ contains as subgraphs all graphs with chromatic number $4$ with sufficiently large girth.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EHS74] Erd\\H{o}s, P. and Hajnal, A. and Shelah, S., On some general properties of chromatic numbers.
