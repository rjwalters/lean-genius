A positive answer to the main question was provided by Vose \\cite{Vo84} by constructing a specific sequence. It remains open whether the two explicit sequences mentioned above satisfy this property.\n\nErd\\H{o}s remarks that this problem occurred to him when considering $\\sum_i \\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i}$. It is easy to see that\\[\\sum_{i} \\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i}> \\tau(n)+\\log n,\\]and Erd\\H{o}s asked whether\\[\\liminf \\left(\\sum_{i} \\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i}-\\tau(n)-\\log n\\right)<\\infty,\\]which would follow from an affirmative answer to the main question.\n\nThis resembles the function considered in [673].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er81h] Erd\\H{o}s, P., Some problems and results on additive and multiplicative\nnumber theory.
