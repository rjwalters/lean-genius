If $A\\subseteq \\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ has $\\lvert A\\rvert \\geq \\epsilon N$ then must there exist $a_1,a_2,a_3\\in A$ and distinct primes $p_1,p_2,p_3$ such that\\[a_1p_1=a_2p_2=a_3p_3?\\]\n\n\n\nA positive answer would imply [536].\n\nErd\\H{o}s describes a construction of Ruzsa which disproves this: consider the set of all squarefree numbers of the shape $p_1\\cdots p_r$ where $p_{i+1}>2p_i$ for $1\\leq i<r$. This set has positive density, and hence if $A$ is its intersection with $(N/2,N)$ then $\\lvert A\\rvert \\gg N$ for all large $N$. Suppose now that $p_1a_1=p_2a_2=p_3a_3$ where $a_i\\in A$ and $p_1,p_2,p_3$ are distinct primes. Without loss of generality we may assume that $a_2>a_3$ and hence $p_2<p_3$, and so since $p_2p_3\\mid a_1\\in A$ we must have $2<p_3/p_2$. On the other hand $p_3/p_2=a_2/a_3\\in (1,2)$, a contradiction.\n\n\nBack to the problem",
