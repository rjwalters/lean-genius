Is it true that if $G$ has maximum degree $o(n^{1/2})$ then $h(G)=o(n^2)$?\n\n\n\nA problem of Erd\\H{o}s, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, and Ruszink\\'{o} \\cite{EGR98}. Simonovits showed that there exist graphs $G$ with maximum degree $\\gg n^{1/2}$ and $h_2(G)\\gg n^2$.\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, and Ruszink\\'{o} \\cite{EGR98} proved that if $G$ has no isolated vertices and maximum degree $O(1)$ then $h_2(G)\\ll n\\log n$.\n\nAlon has observed this problem is essentially identical to [134], and his solution in this note also solves this problem in the affirmative.\n\nSee also [619].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGR98] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Gy\\'{a}rf\\'{a}s, Andr\\'{a}s and\nRuszink\\'{o}, Mikl\\'{o}s, How to decrease the diameter of triangle-free graphs.
