The same question can be asked for parallelograms. It is not true for rhombuses.\n\nThis is false; Kova\\v{c} \\cite{Ko23} provides an explicit (and elegantly simple) colouring using 25 colours such that no colour class contains the vertices of a rectangle of area $1$. The question for parallelograms remains open.\n\nThis problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Gr80] Graham, R.
