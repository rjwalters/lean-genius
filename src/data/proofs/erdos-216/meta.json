  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #216: Empty Convex Polygons**\n\nThis is a variant of the famous 'Happy Ending Problem' (Erdős #107). The key difference is requiring the convex polygon to be EMPTY - no other points from the set lie in its interior.\n\n**Historical Timeline:**\n- 1935: Erdős and Szekeres study convex polygons (non-empty variant)\n- Erdős observed g(4) = 5 (same as happy ending)\n- 1978: Harborth proved g(5) = 10\n- 1983: Horton constructed sets with no empty 7-gon, proving g(k) doesn't exist for k ≥ 7\n- 2007: Nicolás proved g(6) exists\n- 2008: Gerken independently proved g(6) exists\n- 2024: Heule-Scheucher determined g(6) = 30 using SAT solvers\n\n**The Problem:** For each k, what is the minimum n such that any n points in general position contain an empty convex k-gon?",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Partially Solved)**\n\nLet g(k) be the smallest integer (if it exists) such that any g(k) points in ℝ² in general position contains an empty convex k-gon (a convex k-gon with no point in its interior).\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Does g(k) exist for all k?\n2. If so, what is g(k)?\n\n**Complete Answer:**\n- g(3) = 3 (trivial: any 3 points form an empty triangle)\n- g(4) = 5 (Erdős)\n- g(5) = 10 (Harborth, 1978)\n- g(6) = 30 (Heule-Scheucher, 2024)\n- g(k) does NOT exist for k ≥ 7 (Horton, 1983)\n\n**Status: COMPLETELY RESOLVED** - The function g(k) exists if and only if k ≤ 6.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Point Sets:** Define Point as EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2), PointSet as Finset Point\n\n2. **General Position:** InGeneralPosition requires no three collinear points\n\n3. **Empty Polygons:** IsEmptyConvexKGon requires k vertices forming a convex polygon with no other points inside\n\n4. **The Function g:** Define as Option ℕ - returns some n when threshold exists, none otherwise\n\n5. **Known Values:** Axiomatize g(3)=3, g(4)=5, g(5)=10, g(6)=30 based on published results\n\n6. **Horton's Theorem:** Define Horton sets and axiomatize their existence; prove g(7)=none\n\n7. **Connection:** Link to Happy Ending Problem and Erdős-Szekeres conjecture",

      "**Horton Sets:** These ingenious constructions have arbitrarily many points but no empty 7-gon, constructed by recursively interlacing smaller Horton sets",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #216 is completely resolved. The function g(k) - the minimum number of points guaranteeing an empty convex k-gon - exists precisely for k ≤ 6. The exact values are g(3)=3, g(4)=5, g(5)=10, and g(6)=30 (the last determined by Heule-Scheucher in 2024 using SAT solvers). Horton's 1983 construction of arbitrarily large point sets with no empty 7-gon proves g(k) does not exist for k ≥ 7.",
    "implications": "**Geometric Ramsey Theory Connections**\n\n1. **Happy Ending Problem:** The non-empty version (Erdős #107) has g'(k) for all k, conjectured to be 2^(k-2)+1\n\n2. **Computational Methods:** The g(6)=30 result showcases the power of SAT solvers in discrete geometry\n\n3. **Horton Sets:** These constructions have applications beyond this problem in computational geometry\n\n4. **Complete Resolution:** Unlike many Erdős problems, this one has a complete answer\n\n5. **Threshold Phenomenon:** The sharp transition at k=7 is a beautiful combinatorial result",
