  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem in conversation with Berend and independently with Freud (1992). B₂[r] sets generalize Sidon sets by allowing up to r representations. The question is whether sums and differences behave differently for r ≥ 2.",

    "proofStrategy": "Defines sum and difference representation counts, B₂[r] and difference B₂[r] properties, and their maximum sizes in {1,...,N}. States the classical r=1 equality, the main conjecture c'ᵣ < cᵣ, and its weaker form.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "For r = 1, both constants equal 1 (classical Sidon set theory)",
      "Sum representations a+b with a≤b and differences a-b have different combinatorial structures",
      "The asymmetry of subtraction vs the symmetry of addition could cause the constants to differ",
      "Even proving the limits cᵣ and c'ᵣ exist is nontrivial for r ≥ 2"
