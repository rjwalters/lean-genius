  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**The Interval Covering Problem**\\n\\nErdős and Surányi posed this problem in their 1959 paper on a mathematical competition problem. The question asks: given a set A of n positive integers ≥ 2, how long must an interval be to guarantee we can find n distinct multiples (one for each element of A)?\\n\\n**The Function f(n)**\\n\\nf(n) is defined as the minimal k such that any interval of k·max(A) consecutive integers contains distinct x₁,...,xₙ with aᵢ | xᵢ. The factor max(A) normalizes for the size of elements.\\n\\n**Erdős-Surányi Bounds (1959)**\\n\\nThey proved (log n)^c ≪ f(n) ≪ √n for some constant c > 0. The lower bound uses probabilistic arguments with prime sets, while the upper bound uses greedy covering.\\n\\n**The Gap**\\n\\nThe gap between (log n)^c and √n is substantial. For n = 10^6, this is roughly the difference between 10^2 and 10^3. Closing this gap remains open.\\n\\n**Related Problem 708**\\n\\nProblem 708 asks a related question about the size of a covering subset B rather than interval length. The two problems share techniques from divisibility theory and covering arguments.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be minimal such that, for any A = {a₁,...,aₙ} ⊆ [2,∞) ∩ ℕ of size n, in any interval I of f(n)·max(A) consecutive integers there exist distinct x₁,...,xₙ ∈ I such that aᵢ | xᵢ. Obtain good bounds for f(n), or even an asymptotic formula.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining ValidSet, Interval, and Covering structures. The function f(n) is axiomatized with its key properties. We state the Erdős-Surányi bounds as axioms: lower_bound_log gives (log n)^c and upper_bound_sqrt gives √n. The main theorem erdos_709_statement combines these. We include computational examples showing √100 = 10 and √10000 = 100 to illustrate the upper bound scale.",
