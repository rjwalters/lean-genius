    "historicalContext": "**The Interval Covering Problem**\n\nErdős and Surányi posed this problem in their 1959 paper \"Bemerkungen zu einer Aufgabe eines mathematischen Wettbewerbs\" (Remarks on a problem from a mathematical competition), published in Matematikai Lapok. The question asks: given a set A of n positive integers all at least 2, how long must an interval of consecutive integers be to guarantee we can find n distinct multiples, one for each element of A?\n\n**The Function f(n) and Its Bounds**\n\nThe function f(n) is defined as the minimal k such that any interval of k·max(A) consecutive integers contains distinct x₁,...,xₙ with aᵢ | xᵢ, for every valid n-element set A. Erdős and Surányi proved that (log n)^c ≪ f(n) ≪ √n for some constant c > 0. The lower bound uses probabilistic arguments with sets of distinct primes: by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, multiples of different primes are nearly independent, so short intervals can fail to provide enough distinct multiples. The upper bound follows from a greedy covering argument, or equivalently from Hall's marriage theorem: in a long enough interval, each element has enough multiples to guarantee a system of distinct representatives.\n\n**The Open Gap and Related Work**\n\nThe gap between (log n)^c and √n is substantial — for n = 10⁶, this spans roughly two orders of magnitude. Erdős revisited the problem in his 1992 survey [Er92c] on favourite combinatorics problems. The closely related Problem 708 asks about the function g(n), the minimal size of a covering subset rather than an interval length. Both problems illuminate the structure of divisibility patterns but from different geometric perspectives.",
    "problemStatement": "Let $f(n)$ denote the minimal value such that for any set $A = \\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\} \\subseteq [2, \\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{N}$ of size $n$, in any interval $I$ of $f(n) \\cdot \\max(A)$ consecutive integers there exist distinct $x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in I$ where $a_i \\mid x_i$. Obtain good bounds for $f(n)$, or even an asymptotic formula. **Known:** $(\\log n)^c \\ll f(n) \\ll \\sqrt{n}$ (Erdős-Surányi, 1959). **Status:** OPEN.",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the problem by defining ValidSet (sets A ⊆ [2,∞)), Interval (consecutive integer ranges), and Covering (injective assignments with divisibility). The function f(n) is axiomatized with positivity and sufficiency properties. The Erdős-Surányi bounds are stated as axioms: lower_bound_log gives (log n)^c and upper_bound_sqrt gives √n. We formalize the openness of the problem via axioms asserting neither bound is tight. The proof techniques are captured: lower_bound_prime_crt formalizes the existence of prime sets for the CRT-based lower bound argument, and upper_bound_halls_theorem captures the Hall's marriage theorem approach for the upper bound. Computational examples verify √100 = 10 and √10000 = 100 via native_decide.",
