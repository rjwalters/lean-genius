  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem studies how to decrease graph diameter by adding edges while preserving triangle-freeness. Erdős, Gyárfás, and Ruszinkó (1998) introduced h_r(G) as the minimum edges needed to achieve diameter r. They proved bounds for h₃ and h₅, but h₄ remains open.\n\nWithout the triangle-free constraint, Alon, Gyárfás, and Ruszinkó (2000) showed n/2 edges always suffice for diameter 4.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question (OPEN):** Does there exist c > 0 such that h₄(G) < (1-c)n for all connected triangle-free graphs G on n vertices?\n\n**Known bounds:**\n- h₃(G) ≤ n (tight: some G have h₃(G) ≥ n - c)\n- h₄(G) ≤ ? (OPEN)\n- h₅(G) ≤ (n-1)/2",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. **TriangleFree:** No K₃ subgraphs\n2. **diameter:** Max distance between vertices\n3. **addEdges:** Graph augmentation operation\n4. **h(G, r):** Min edges to achieve diameter r while triangle-free\n\nWe axiomatize known bounds for h₃ and h₅, and state the open h₄ question.",
