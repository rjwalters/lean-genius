  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős posed this problem with a $10,000 reward, calling it 'probably unattackable at present.' It builds on Szemerédi's celebrated theorem (1975) that r_k(N) = o(N), Roth's Fourier-analytic proof for k=3 (1953), and Behrend's 1946 construction giving r_3(N) ≥ N·exp(-C√(log N)). The 2023 breakthrough by Kelley and Meka gives r_3(N) ≤ N·exp(-c(log N)^{1/12}), but the gap from Behrend remains vast.",
    "problemStatement": "Prove an asymptotic formula for r_k(N), the largest size of a subset of {1,...,N} containing no non-trivial k-term arithmetic progression.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define AP-k-free sets and r_k(N), state Szemerédi's theorem and Roth's theorem as axioms, record the best known upper bound (Kelley–Meka for k=3, Green–Tao for k=4) and lower bound (Behrend), and formalize the main open question as the existence of an asymptotic formula.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Even for k = 3, the gap between Behrend (exp(-C√(log N))) and Kelley–Meka (exp(-c(log N)^{1/12})) is enormous",
      "Erdős offered $5,000 for the weaker result r_k(N) = o(N/log N)",
      "Szemerédi's theorem guarantees r_k(N)/N → 0 but gives no effective rate for large k",
      "Fourier-analytic methods work for k = 3 (Roth), density-increment for k = 4 (Green–Tao), but k ≥ 5 requires different techniques",
      "Leng–Sah–Sawhney (2024) provide the best bounds for k ≥ 5 using novel algebraic methods"

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #142 remains one of the hardest open problems in combinatorics. Despite extraordinary progress — Szemerédi's theorem, Roth's Fourier method, the Kelley–Meka breakthrough — even the order of magnitude of r_3(N) is unknown, let alone an asymptotic formula for general k.",
    "implications": "An asymptotic formula for r_k(N) would represent a complete understanding of the density threshold for arithmetic progressions, resolving a central question in additive combinatorics with connections to ergodic theory, harmonic analysis, and theoretical computer science.",
    "openQuestions": [
      "What is the true order of magnitude of r_3(N)?",
      "Is r_k(N) = o(N/log N) for all k ≥ 3? ($5,000 Erdős prize)",
      "Is the Behrend-type lower bound or the Kelley–Meka upper bound closer to the truth for k = 3?",
