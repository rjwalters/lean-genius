    "historicalContext": "**Erdős Problem #360**\n\nThis problem asks about partitioning integers to avoid subset sums, a fundamental question in additive combinatorics with connections to Ramsey theory.\n\n**Key History:**\n- Erdős and Graham (1980): Original problem in \"Old and new problems and results in combinatorial number theory\"\n- Alon-Erdős (1996): Proved f(n) = n^{1/3+o(1)}, establishing cube-root growth\n- Vu (2007): Improved lower bound to n^{1/3}/log n\n- Conlon-Fox-Pham (2021): Determined exact order up to constants\n\n**Mathematical Setting:**\nGiven n, we want to partition {1,2,...,n-1} into the minimum number of classes such that no class contains distinct elements summing to n. This is a Ramsey-type problem about avoiding specific additive structures.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (Solved)**\n\nLet f(n) be minimal such that {1,...,n-1} can be partitioned into f(n) classes so that n cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct elements from the same class. How fast does f(n) grow?\n\n**Answer:**\n$$f(n) \\asymp \\frac{n^{1/3}(n/\\phi(n))}{(\\log n)^{1/3}(\\log\\log n)^{2/3}}$$\n\nConlon, Fox, and Pham (2021) determined the order of growth up to a multiplicative constant, resolving the problem.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Formalization Approach**\n\n1. **Core Definitions:**\n   - IsNSumFree: predicate for sets avoiding n as a subset sum\n   - IsValidPartition: valid partition of {1,...,n-1}\n   - f(n): minimum partition size using sInf\n\n2. **Historical Results as Axioms:**\n   - Alon-Erdős 1996: initial bounds n^{1/3}/(log n)^{4/3} to n^{1/3}/(log n)^{1/3}(log log n)^{1/3}\n   - Vu 2007: lower bound n^{1/3}/log n\n   - Conlon-Fox-Pham 2021: exact order with φ(n) factor\n\n3. **Key Insights:**\n   - Cube-root growth from greedy argument (3 elements of size ~n^{1/3} sum to ~n)\n   - n/φ(n) factor captures arithmetic structure\n\n4. **Small Cases:** f(2)=1, f(3)=1, f(4)=2",
