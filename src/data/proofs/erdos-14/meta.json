    "historicalContext": "Erdős asked about the minimum non-unique sum count for subsets of ℕ. Erdős–Sárközy–Szemerédi showed O(N^{1/2+ε}) is achievable but Ω(N^{1/3−ε}) occurs infinitely often. Erdős–Freud gave the finite analogue with constant 2^{3/2}. The exact exponent in the lower bound remains open.",

    "proofStrategy": "We formalize unique sums, non-unique count for both finite and infinite sets, the two open questions, the ESS upper/lower bounds, the Erdős–Freud finite result, and structural observations about Sidon sets.",
