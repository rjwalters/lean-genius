  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "For 2000 years, mathematicians tried to prove Euclid's fifth postulate from the others. Bolyai and Lobachevsky independently developed hyperbolic geometry (1820s-1830s), and Beltrami (1868) proved its consistency by constructing models within Euclidean geometry.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorem**: The parallel postulate (Playfair's axiom: through any point not on a line, exactly one parallel exists) is independent of neutral geometry axioms.\n\nThis means neither the postulate nor its negation can be proved from the other axioms.",
    "proofStrategy": "Model-theoretic: construct two models of neutral geometry, one satisfying the parallel postulate (Euclidean plane) and one violating it (Poincare disk). Since both models satisfy neutral geometry but disagree on the parallel postulate, the postulate is independent.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Independence is proved by exhibiting models that differ on the statement",
      "The Poincare disk provides a concrete model of hyperbolic geometry",
      "Non-Euclidean geometries are just as consistent as Euclidean geometry",
