  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős (1946) proved that if f is additive and f(n+1) - f(n) = o(1) or f(n+1) ≥ f(n), then f(n) = c·log(n). He asked whether bounded consecutive differences (|f(n+1) - f(n)| < c) also imply a logarithmic form. Wirsing (1970) resolved this affirmatively with the weaker conclusion f(n) = c'·log(n) + O(1).",
    "problemStatement": "Let f: ℕ → ℝ be an additive function (f(ab) = f(a) + f(b) when gcd(a,b) = 1). If there exists c such that |f(n+1) - f(n)| < c for all n, must there exist c' such that f(n) = c'·log(n) + O(1)?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines additive functions, bounded consecutive differences, and the characterization f(n) = c'·log(n) + O(1). Wirsing's theorem is stated as an axiom, along with Erdős's 1946 results as special cases. The uniqueness of the coefficient c' and connections to prime factorization are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Additive functions with bounded consecutive differences are essentially logarithmic",
      "The logarithm is characterized as the unique additive function (up to scaling) with this regularity",
      "Bounded differences give f = c'·log + O(1), while vanishing differences give exact f = c·log",
      "Additive functions are determined by their values on prime powers",
      "The coefficient c' in the characterization is unique"
