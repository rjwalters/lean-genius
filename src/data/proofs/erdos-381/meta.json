    "summary": "Erdős Problem #381 was DISPROVED by Nicolas in 1971. The question asked whether Q(x), counting highly composite numbers up to x, grows faster than any power of log x. Nicolas proved Q(x) ≪ (log x)^C for some constant C, showing the growth is bounded polynomially in log x.",
    "implications": "**Key results:**\n\n1. **Highly composite numbers are quite sparse** - their count grows subpolynomially in x.\n2. **Bounded in log x** - Q(x) grows only like (log x)^α for some fixed α.\n3. **Ramanujan's structure** - HC numbers have specific prime factorization properties.\n4. **Related to divisor extrema** - understanding when τ(n) achieves records.",
