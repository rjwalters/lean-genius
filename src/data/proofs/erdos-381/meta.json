  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Ramanujan's Foundation (1915)**\n\nSrinivasa Ramanujan initiated the systematic study of highly composite numbers in his 1915 paper \"Highly Composite Numbers,\" one of his most substantial works at 52 pages. He provided a complete characterization of these numbers: if n = 2^{a₁}·3^{a₂}·...·p^{a_k}, then n is highly composite iff the exponents are non-increasing (a₁ ≥ a₂ ≥ ... ≥ a_k ≥ 1). This structural insight remains fundamental.\n\n**Erdős's Counting Question (1944)**\n\nPaul Erdős turned attention to how many highly composite numbers exist up to x. He proved Q(x) ≫ (log x)^{1+c} for some c > 0, showing they are more common than a naive analysis suggests. His 1944 paper \"On highly composite and similar numbers\" posed the natural question: does Q(x) grow faster than ANY fixed power of log x?\n\n**Nicolas's Resolution (1971)**\n\nJean-Louis Nicolas definitively answered NO. In \"Répartition des nombres hautement composés de Ramanujan,\" he proved Q(x) ≪ (log x)^C for an absolute constant C ≈ 1.71. This polynomial upper bound in log x directly contradicts growth faster than all powers, settling Erdős's question in the negative.",
    "problemStatement": "**Question (Erdős):** Let Q(x) count highly composite numbers (numbers with more divisors than any smaller number) up to x. Is it true that Q(x) ≫_k (log x)^k for every k ≥ 1?\n\n**Answer: NO** (Nicolas 1971)\n\nNicolas proved Q(x) ≪ (log x)^C, showing the count grows only polynomially in log x.",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines:\n\n1. **tau(n):** Divisor counting function\n2. **IsHighlyComposite:** n has more divisors than all smaller numbers\n3. **Q(x):** Count of highly composite numbers up to x\n4. **erdos_question:** The conjecture Q(x) ≫_k (log x)^k for all k\n\nWe axiomatize Erdős's lower bound and Nicolas's upper bound, then prove the question is false.",
