  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp introduced the notion of Ramsey size linearity in 1993, asking which graphs G have the property that r̂(G,H) = O(|E(H)|). They showed graphs with at most n+1 edges satisfy this, and posed the (2k−3)-sparsity conjecture.",
    "problemStatement": "Let G be a graph such that every subgraph on k vertices has at most 2k−3 edges. Is G Ramsey size linear, meaning r̂(G,H) ≤ c·m for every graph H with m edges and no isolated vertices?",
    "proofStrategy": "We define sparsity, size Ramsey numbers, and Ramsey size linearity. We state the main conjecture, the EFRS positive result for ≤ n+1 edges, and the counterexample showing the (2k−3) threshold is tight.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Every graph with ≤ n+1 edges is Ramsey size linear (EFRS 1993)",
      "Graphs with 2n−2 edges can fail to be Ramsey size linear",
      "The (2k−3) sparsity condition is the conjectured threshold",
      "Trees (n−1 edges) are known to be Ramsey size linear",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #566 conjectures that (2k−3)-sparse graphs are Ramsey size linear. The EFRS result confirms this for graphs with ≤ n+1 edges, and counterexamples at 2n−2 edges show the threshold is tight. The gap between n+1 and 2k−3 remains open.",
