Estimate $f(n,k)$ for $k>n^2/4$.\n\n\n\nThe function $f(n,k)$ is sometimes called the clique partition number.\n\nErd\\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\\'{o}sa \\cite{EGP66} proved that $f(n,k)\\leq n^2/4$ for all $k$ (and in fact the complete graphs can be taken to be edges and triangles), which is best possible in general, as witnessed for example by a complete bipartite graph. In \\cite{Er71} Erd\\H{o} asks vaguely whether this result can be 'sharpened' for $k>n^2/4$.\n\nLov\\'{a}sz \\cite{Lo68} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices and $k$ edges is the union of $\\binom{n}{2}-k+t$ complete graphs, where $t$ is maximal such that $t^2-t\\leq \\binom{n}{2}-k$, but without the assumption that the complete graphs are edge disjoint. Lov\\'{a}sz's result is sharp in many cases.\n\nIf $k>n^2/4$ and the graph contains no $K_4$ then this is equivalent to finding the minimum number of edge disjoint triangles. This special case was also asked about by Erd\\H{o}s. A complete answer was provided by Gy\\\"{o}ri and Keszegh \\cite{GyKe17}, who proved that every $K_4$-free graph with $n$ vertices and $\\lfloor n^2/4\\rfloor+m$ edges contins $m$ pairwise edge disjoint triangles.\n\nSee also [184] for an analogous problem decomposing into edges and cycles, and [583] for decomposing into paths. The clique partition problem for chordal graphs is the subject of [81].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[EGP66] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul and Goodman, A.
