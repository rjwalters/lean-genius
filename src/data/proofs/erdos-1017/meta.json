  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "**Graph Decomposition**\n\nPartitioning a graph into simpler pieces is a fundamental problem. The clique partition number f(n,k) asks: what's the minimum number of complete subgraphs needed to cover all edges exactly once?\n\n**Erdős-Goodman-Pósa (1966)**: Proved the elegant bound f(n,k) ≤ n²/4, achievable using only edges and triangles. This is tight for complete bipartite graphs.\n\n**The Open Question**: Erdős asked whether this bound can be improved when k > n²/4 (more edges than a balanced bipartite graph).\n\n**Partial Progress**: Győri-Keszegh (2017) completely solved the K₄-free case, showing such graphs with n²/4 + m edges contain exactly m edge-disjoint triangles.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement**\n\nLet f(n,k) be such that every graph on n vertices and k edges can be partitioned into at most f(n,k) edge-disjoint complete graphs.\n\n**Known**: f(n,k) ≤ n²/4 for all k (Erdős-Goodman-Pósa 1966)\n\n**Question**: Estimate f(n,k) for k > n²/4. Can the bound be improved for dense graphs?\n\n**Status**: OPEN (general case)\n\n**Special Case**: K₄-free graphs with n²/4 + m edges have exactly m edge-disjoint triangles (Győri-Keszegh 2017).",
    "proofStrategy": "**Approach to the Problem**\n\n1. **Upper Bound (EGP)**: Greedily find triangles, then partition remaining edges. This gives n²/4.\n\n2. **Lower Bound**: Complete bipartite graphs have no triangles, so each edge needs its own 'clique'. K_{n/2,n/2} has n²/4 edges.\n\n3. **Dense Graphs**: When k > n²/4, the graph has 'extra' edges. Can these form larger cliques that reduce the count?\n\n4. **K₄-Free Case**: Without K₄, extra edges must form triangles. Győri-Keszegh showed these triangles are edge-disjoint.\n\n**Key Difficulty**: When K₄ is allowed, edges might belong to multiple potential clique partitions.",
