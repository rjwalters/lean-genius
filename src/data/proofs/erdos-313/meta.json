  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this in their 1980 monograph. The equation ∑ 1/p = 1 − 1/m with P a set of distinct primes leads to 'primary pseudoperfect numbers,' cataloged as OEIS A054377. Only 8 are known; the largest has 31 digits.",
    "problemStatement": "Are there infinitely many integers m ≥ 2 such that ∑_{p ∈ P} 1/p = 1 − 1/m for some finite set P of distinct primes?",
    "proofStrategy": "We formalize the solution set, the primary pseudoperfect property, verify known examples, state the product constraint (m = ∏P) and uniqueness, and connect to Egyptian fraction representations.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "m must equal the product of all primes in P",
      "At most one prime set P works for each m (uniqueness)",
      "The equation rewrites as 1/p₁ + ··· + 1/pₖ + 1/m = 1 (Egyptian fraction of 1)",
      "Only 8 primary pseudoperfect numbers are known",
      "The known sequence grows extremely rapidly: 2, 6, 42, 1806, 47058, ..."
