  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the 2-full (squareful) part B₂(n) of integers, which captures prime powers p² and higher. B₂(n) = n/squarefreePart(n). The problem asks about products of B₂ over k consecutive integers.\n\nFor k ≤ 2, the product is ≤ n² trivially since B₂(n) ≤ n. For k ≥ 3, van Doorn showed the strong n² bound fails: there exist infinitely many n with ∏B₂(m) ≫ n²·log n. The weak bound n^{2+o(1)} remains open for all k.",
    "problemStatement": "Let B₂(n) = n/squarefreePart(n) denote the 2-full part. For every fixed k ≥ 1, is it true that ∏_{n ≤ m < n+k} B₂(m) ≪ n^{2+o(1)}? Or perhaps even ≪_k n²?",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization defines squarefreePart, twoFullPart, and productTwoFullParts. Weak and strong bounds are defined as propositions. Known results (k ≤ 2 strong bound, k ≥ 3 failure, van Doorn lower bound) are axioms. Properties of B₂ (squarefree characterization, multiplicativity, divisibility) are axioms. The r-full generalization is defined with a proved consistency theorem. A summary theorem combines the known results.",

      "van Doorn: for k = 3, ∏B₂(m) can be ≫ n²·log n, so strong bound fails",
      "The weak bound n^{2+o(1)} remains open — the gap is the logarithmic factor",
