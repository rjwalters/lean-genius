  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem concerns the 2-full (squareful) part of integers, which captures the contribution from prime powers p² and higher. The problem asks about the growth of products of these parts over consecutive integers, connecting to questions about the distribution of powerful numbers.",
    "problemStatement": "Let B₂(n) denote the 2-full part of n (the ratio n/n', where n' is the squarefree part). For every fixed k ≥ 1, is it true that ∏_{n ≤ m < n+k} B₂(m) ≪ n^{2+o(1)}? Or perhaps even ≪_k n²?",
    "proofStrategy": "The trivial cases k ≤ 2 follow from B₂(n) ≤ n. For k ≥ 3, van Doorn showed the strong n² bound fails by exhibiting sequences where the product grows as n²·log n. The weak n^{2+ε} bound remains open.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "B₂(n) = 1 when n is squarefree",
      "B₂(n) = n when n is a perfect power",
      "For k ≤ 2, the bound ≪ n² holds trivially",
      "For k ≥ 3, van Doorn showed ∏B₂(m) can be ≫ n²·log n",
      "The weak bound n^{2+o(1)} remains open"

      "content": "For k = 1, the product is just B₂(n) ≤ n ≤ n². For k = 2, B₂(n)·B₂(n+1) ≤ n·(n+1) < n². So the strong bound holds for k ≤ 2."

      "content": "For k = 3, van Doorn showed there exist infinitely many n with ∏_{n ≤ m < n+3} B₂(m) ≫ n²·log n. This disproves the strong n² bound for k ≥ 3."

    "summary": "Erdős Problem #367 asks about products of 2-full parts over consecutive integers. The strong n² bound fails for k ≥ 3 (van Doorn), but the weak n^{2+o(1)} bound remains open.",
