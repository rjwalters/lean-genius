  "description": "Determine R(C₂ₙ; k), the multicolor Ramsey number of even cycles. Erdős showed k^{1+1/(2n)} ≪ R(C₂ₙ; k) ≪ k^{1+1/(n-1)}. For C₄, Chung–Graham gave k²−k+1 < R(C₄;k) ≤ k²+k+1. The exact growth rate is open.",

  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem of Erdős and Graham asks for the precise growth rate of the multicolor Ramsey number for even cycles. The problem connects extremal graph theory with projective geometry (the C₄ case relates to finite projective planes).",
    "problemStatement": "Determine R(C₂ₙ; k): the minimum m such that every k-coloring of the edges of Kₘ yields a monochromatic C₂ₙ.",
    "proofStrategy": "Defines cycle containment, edge colorings, and the Ramsey number for even cycles. States Erdős's general upper and lower bounds, the sharp Chung–Graham bounds for C₄, and the main open problem of determining the exact exponent.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "The lower bound k^{1+1/(2n)} comes from probabilistic constructions",
      "The upper bound k^{1+1/(n-1)} uses the Szemerédi regularity method",
      "For C₄, the bounds k²±k+1 are nearly tight, relating to projective planes",
      "The gap between exponents 1/(2n) and 1/(n-1) is the central open question"
