For which $d$ must $A$ contain a three-term arithmetic progression?\n\n\n\nThis is true for $d\\leq 3$ and false for $d\\geq 4$.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to one on 'abelian squares' (see [231]). In particular $A$ can be interpreted as an infinite string over an alphabet with $d$ letters (each letter describining which of the $d$ possible steps is taken at each point). An abelian square in a string $s$ is a pair of consecutive blocks $x$ and $y$ appearing in $s$ such that $y$ is a permutation of $x$. The connection comes from the observation that $p,q,r\\in A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ form a three-term arithmetic progression if and only if the string corresponding to the steps from $p$ to $q$ is a permutation of the string corresponding to the steps from $q$ to $r$.\n\nThis problem is therefore equivalent to asking for which $d$ there exists an infinite string over $\\{1,\\ldots,d\\}$ with no abelian squares. It is easy to check that in fact any finite string of length $7$ over $\\{1,2,3\\}$ contains an abelian square.\n\nAn infinite string without abelian squares was constructed when $d=4$ by Keränen \\cite{Ke92}. We refer to a recent survey by Fici and Puzynina \\cite{FiPu23} for more background and related results, and a blog post by Renan for an entertaining and educational discussion.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[FiPu23] Fici, Gabriele and Puzynina, Svetlana, Abelian combinatorics on words: a survey.
