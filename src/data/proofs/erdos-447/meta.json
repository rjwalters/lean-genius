By union-free we mean there are no solutions to $A\\cup B=C$ with distinct $A,B,C\\in \\mathcal{F}$. Must $\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert =o(2^n)$? Perhaps even\\[\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert <(1+o(1))\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}?\\]\n\n\n\nThe estimate $\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert=o(2^n)$ implies that if $A\\subset \\mathbb{N}$ is a set of positive density then there are infinitely many distinct $a,b,c\\in A$ such that $[a,b]=c$ (i.e. [487]).\n\nIn \\cite{Er65b} Erd\\H{o}s reported that the estimate $\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert=o(2^n)$ was proved in unpublished work by S\\'{a}rk\\\"{o}zy and Szemer\\'{e}di.\n\nSolved by Kleitman \\cite{Kl71}, who proved\\[\\lvert \\mathcal{F}\\rvert <(1+o(1))\\binom{n}{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}.\\]If we forbid the union of any number of sets in $\\mathcal{F}$ being in the family then this is the subject of [1023].\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er65b] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, Some recent advances and current problems in number theory.
