  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "This problem in dimension theory asks whether a topological space can have the same covering dimension as its product with itself. The covering dimension (Lebesgue dimension) of most 'nice' spaces satisfies dim(X × Y) ≤ dim(X) + dim(Y), with equality for many common spaces. The question is whether dim(S × S) = dim(S) is possible.\n\nFor n = 1, the rational points in Hilbert space provide an example. Anderson and Keisler (1967) generalized this to all n ≥ 1, constructing separable metric spaces with this surprising property.",
    "problemStatement": "**Problem Statement (SOLVED)**\n\nLet n ≥ 1. Is there a space S of dimension n such that S² = S × S also has dimension n?\n\n**Answer:** YES (Anderson-Keisler 1967)\n\nFor every n ≥ 1, there exist separable metric spaces S_n with:\n- dim(S_n) = n\n- dim(S_n × S_n) = n",
    "proofStrategy": "The formalization axiomatizes covering dimension and states the Anderson-Keisler theorem. The proof uses:\n\n1. **Covering dimension definition:** dimension ≤ n if covers have refinements with multiplicity ≤ n+1\n\n2. **Examples:** Rational points in Hilbert space for n=1\n\n3. **Main theorem:** Anderson-Keisler construction works for all n ≥ 1\n\n4. **Background:** Product dimension inequality, dimension of subspaces",

  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #909 is SOLVED. The answer is YES - for every n ≥ 1, there exist separable metric spaces S_n of dimension n such that S_n × S_n also has dimension n. This was proved by Anderson and Keisler in 1967. The construction uses techniques from descriptive set theory and dimension theory.",
    "implications": "This result shows that dimension theory contains surprising phenomena. While 'nice' spaces like [0,1] have dim([0,1]²) = 2, special constructions can achieve dim(S²) = dim(S). This connects to the study of pathological topological spaces and infinite-dimensional topology.",
