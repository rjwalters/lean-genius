  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "The distinct distances problem is one of Erdős's most famous problems in combinatorial geometry, posed in 1946. Given n points in the plane, how many distinct pairwise distances must exist?\n\nThe √n × √n integer grid has only O(n/√(log n)) distinct distances, showing this bound would be tight if true. Erdős offered $500 for a proof.\n\nAfter decades of progress (Chung 1992, Solymosi-Tóth 2001, Tardos 2004), Guth and Katz made a breakthrough in 2015, proving Ω(n/log n) distinct distances using algebraic methods. This is tantalizingly close to Erdős's conjecture, differing only by a factor of √(log n).",
