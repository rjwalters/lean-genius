Nearly solved by Guth and Katz \\cite{GuKa15} who proved that there are always $\\gg n/\\log n$ many distinct distances.\n\nA stronger form (see [604]) may be true: is there a single point which determines $\\gg n/\\sqrt{\\log n}$ distinct distances, or even $\\gg n$ many such points, or even that this is true averaged over all points - for example, if $d(x)$ counts the number of distinct distances from $x$ then in \\cite{Er75f} Erd\\H{o}s conjectured\\[\\sum_{x\\in A}d(x) \\gg \\frac{n^2}{\\sqrt{\\log n}},\\]where $A\\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is any set of $n$ points.\n\nSee also [661], and [1083] for the generalisation to higher dimensions.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[Er75f] Erd\\H{o}s, Paul, On some problems of elementary and combinatorial geometry.
