  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Johann Faulhaber (1580-1635) discovered closed-form formulas for sums of powers up to k=17 without knowing the general pattern involving Bernoulli numbers.\n\nThe sum of cubes formula was known to Nicomachus of Gerasa (c. 100 CE) and later proved by Aryabhata in India (499 CE). The sum of squares formula appears in Archimedes' work on spirals.",
    "problemStatement": "**Theorems proven:**\n\n1. Sum of first powers: sum_{i=0}^n i = n(n+1)/2 (Gauss's formula)\n2. Sum of squares: sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6\n3. Sum of cubes: sum_{i=0}^n i^3 = [n(n+1)/2]^2\n4. **Nicomachus**: sum of cubes = (sum of first powers)^2\n5. Sum of fourth powers: sum_{i=0}^n i^4 = n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n²+3n-1)/30\n6. Sum of fifth powers: sum_{i=0}^n i^5 = n²(n+1)²(2n²+2n-1)/12\n\nThis is Wiedijk's 100 Theorems #77.",
    "proofStrategy": "**Proof by Induction**:\n\n1. For each formula, prove the base case (n=0)\n2. Assume the formula holds for n\n3. Add the (n+1)th term and simplify\n4. Verify algebraically that the formula holds for n+1\n\nDivisibility lemmas (e.g., 6 | n(n+1)(2n+1)) are proven using modular arithmetic.",
