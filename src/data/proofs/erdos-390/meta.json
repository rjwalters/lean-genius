  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham posed this problem about expressing n! as a product of distinct integers all greater than n. Erdős, Guy, and Selfridge (1982) proved f(n) - 2n ≍ n/log n, establishing the correct order of magnitude. Whether a precise constant exists remains open.",
    "problemStatement": "Let f(n) be the minimal m such that n! = a₁·a₂·⋯·aₖ with n < a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ < aₖ = m. Is there a constant c such that f(n) - 2n ~ c · n / log n?",
    "proofStrategy": "We axiomatize factorizationMax (f) and state the basic lower bound f(n) ≥ 2n. The Erdős–Guy–Selfridge two-sided bounds are axiomatized. ErdosProblem390 asks whether the normalized ratio converges. Existence of factorizations, small values, monotonicity, and unboundedness of the excess are included.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "Expressing n! as a product of distinct factors all > n is always possible for n ≥ 3",
      "The trivial bound f(n) ≥ 2n comes from counting arguments",
      "The secondary term n/log n arises from prime factorization structure",
      "Whether the ratio (f(n) - 2n)·log n/n has a limit is the open question"
