Is it true that, if $n$ is sufficiently large depending on $C$, then in any $2$-colouring of $\\binom{\\{2,\\ldots,n\\}}{2}$ there exists some $X\\subset \\{2,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that $\\binom{X}{2}$ is monochromatic and\\[\\sum_{x\\in X}\\frac{1}{\\log x}\\geq C?\\]\n\n\n\nThe answer is yes, which was proved by R\\\"{o}dl \\cite{Ro03}.\n\nIn the same article R\\\"{o}dl also proved a lower bound for this problem, constructing, for all $n$, a $2$-colouring of $\\binom{\\{2,\\ldots,n\\}}{2}$ such that if $X\\subseteq \\{2,\\ldots,n\\}$ is such that $\\binom{X}{2}$ is monochromatic then\\[\\sum_{x\\in X}\\frac{1}{\\log x}\\ll \\log\\log\\log n.\\]This bound is best possible, as proved by Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov \\cite{CFS13}, who proved that, if $n$ is sufficiently large, then in any $2$-colouring of $\\binom{\\{2,\\ldots,n\\}}{2}$ there exists some $X\\subset \\{2,\\ldots,n\\}$ such that $\\binom{X}{2}$ is monochromatic and\\[\\sum_{x\\in X}\\frac{1}{\\log x}\\geq 2^{-8}\\log\\log\\log n.\\]\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n[CFS13] Conlon, David and Fox, Jacob and Sudakov, Benny, Two extensions of Ramsey's theorem.
