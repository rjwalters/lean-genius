  "overview": {
    "historicalContext": "Erdős and Graham (1976) studied the function F(m), the minimal number of factorials needed in a strictly increasing sequence ending at m whose product is a perfect square. The decomposition of ℕ into the sets Dₖ reveals surprising structure: only D₂ through D₆ are nonempty, and their growth rates are poorly understood.",
    "problemStatement": "Determine the growth rate of |Dₖ ∩ {1,...,n}| for 3 ≤ k ≤ 6, where Dₖ = {m : F(m) = k}.",
    "proofStrategy": "We define IsPerfectSquare, factorialProduct, and HasSquareFactorialProduct constructively, axiomatize F(m) as bigF, and record known structural results about the sets Dₖ.",
    "keyInsights": [
      "D₂ = perfect squares > 1, giving |D₂ ∩ {1,...,n}| = √n + O(1)",
      "No prime belongs to any Dₖ, since a single factorial p! cannot be part of a square product",
      "Dₖ = ∅ for k > 6, so only finitely many classes D₂,...,D₆ partition the relevant integers",
      "The smallest element of D₆ is 527, showing D₆ is sparse",
      "D₃ grows slower than D₄, indicating non-monotone behavior in k"
    ]
  },
  "conclusion": {
    "summary": "Erdős Problem #374 asks for the growth rate of Dₖ (integers requiring exactly k factorials for a square product) for 3 ≤ k ≤ 6. The structure is known — only D₂ through D₆ are nonempty — but growth rates remain open.",
    "implications": "Resolution would connect factorial arithmetic to the distribution of square-free parts and p-adic valuations, with links to Stirling's approximation and multiplicative number theory.",
