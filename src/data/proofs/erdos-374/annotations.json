    "significance": "The definition chain captures the key notion: when can m be the largest element of an increasing sequence whose factorial product is a square?"

    "content": "D₂ equals the perfect squares > 1 (since m! is a square iff m is a square). No prime p belongs to any Dₖ, as factorial products involving p! cannot be squares due to the odd multiplicity of p in p!.",
    "significance": "D₂ is completely characterized, and prime exclusion shows the sets Dₖ have density 0 among primes."

    "significance": "The finiteness of the classification (only 5 nonempty classes) is remarkable. The sparseness of D₆ (starting at 527) suggests higher classes have very few elements."

    "significance": "Understanding these growth rates would complete the picture of how factorials combine to form perfect squares."
