How large can $f(n)$ be?\n2. Is $\\lim f(n)/n$ irrational?\n\n## Key Insight\n\nThis is **WEAKER** than the primitive set condition:\n- **Primitive**: No $a \\mid b$ for distinct $a, b \\in A$ (two-element constraint)\n- **This problem**: No $a$ with $a \\mid b$ AND $a \\mid c$ for distinct $b \\neq c$ (three-element constraint)\n\nExample: $\\{2, 6, 9\\}$ satisfies \"no divides two others\" but is NOT primitive ($2 \\mid 6$).\n\n## Known Results\n\n- **Lower**: $f(n) \\geq \\lceil \\frac{2}{3}n \\rceil$ via $[m+1, 3m+2]$\n- **Lebensold (1976)**: $0.6725n \\leq f(n) \\leq 0.6736n$\n\n## Formalization Progress\n\nCreated `proofs/Proofs/Erdos1062Problem.lean` with:\n- Core definitions (`NoDividesTwoOthers`, `AtMostOneProperMultiple`)\n- The extremal function `f(n)`\n- Lower bound construction and theorem (with sorries)\n- Lebensold bounds as axioms\n- Open irrationality question\n- Comparison with primitive sets (strictly weaker)\n\n## Status\n\n**Erdős Database Status**: OPEN (Problem B24 in Guy's collection)\n**Formalization Status**: PARTIAL - definitions complete, main theorems have sorries\n\n## References\n\n- Guy, R.
