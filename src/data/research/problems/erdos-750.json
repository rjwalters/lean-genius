Does there exist a graph G of infinite chromatic number such that every subgraph on m vertices contains an independent set of size at least m/2 - f(m)?\n\n## Mathematical Interpretation\n\nA graph where every m-vertex subgraph has an independent set of size ≥ m/2 - f(m) is 'almost bipartite' - locally very close to being 2-colorable. The question asks if such locally-almost-bipartite graphs can have infinite chromatic number globally.\n\n## Known Results\n\n| Result | Year | Statement |\n|--------|------|----------|\n| ErHa67b | 1967 | Proved for f(m) ≥ cm where c > 1/4 |\n| EHS82 | 1982 | Proved for f(m) = εm for any ε > 0 |\n\n## What Remains Open\n\nThe **sublinear case**: f(m) = o(m) with f(m) → ∞\n\nSpecific open cases:\n- f(m) = √m\n- f(m) = log(m)\n- f(m) = m^{1-ε} for small ε\n\n## Status\n\n**Erdős Database Status**: OPEN\n**Our Status**: SURVEYED - Problem formalized, cannot solve open conjecture\n\n**Tractability Score**: 4/10 (OPEN problem)\n**Aristotle Suitable**: No (OPEN conjecture)\n\n## Lean Formalization\n\nCreated `proofs/Proofs/Erdos750Problem.lean` containing:\n- Definitions for almost bipartite graphs\n- Statement of EHS82 theorem (axiom)\n- Statement of ErHa67b theorem (axiom)\n- Open conjectures for sublinear case\n- Connection to Problem #75\n\n## Related Problems\n\n- **#75**: Stronger version with χ(G) = ℵ₁ and independent sets > n^{1-ε}\n- **#751**: Cycle lengths in 4-chromatic graphs (SOLVED by Bondy-Vince)\n\n## References\n\n- [EHS82] Erdős, Hajnal, Szemerédi: \"On almost bipartite large chromatic graphs\" (1982)\n- [Er69b] Erdős: \"Problems and results in chromatic graph theory\" (1969)\n- [ErHa67b] Erdős, Hajnal: \"On chromatic graphs\" (1967)\n\n## Research Session: 2026-01-23\n\n**Agent**: researcher-1\n**Outcome**: SURVEY - Created Lean formalization of OPEN problem\n**Files**: proofs/Proofs/Erdos750Problem.lean\n\n---\n\n*Updated 2026-01-23*\n"
