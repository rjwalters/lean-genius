Perelman proved it in 2002-2003 via Ricci flow with surgery.\n\n### Formalization Requirements\n1. 3-manifolds\n2. Simple connectivity (π₁ = 0)\n3. Ricci flow\n4. Surgery on manifolds\n5. Hamilton's program completion\n\n## Blockers\n\n### Primary Blocker: Ricci Flow\n**Status**: BLOCKED\n**Severity**: High (but solvable in principle)\n\nMathlib lacks:\n- [ ] Ricci flow PDE\n- [ ] Surgery on manifolds\n- [ ] Geometric analysis for flows\n- [ ] Perelman's W-functional\n\n### Secondary Blocker: Manifold Theory\nNeed:\n- [ ] Topological 3-manifolds\n- [ ] Poincaré duality in 3D\n- [ ] h-cobordism for dimensions\n\n## Tractable Partial Work\n\nUnlike other Millennium problems, this IS proven:\n1. **Statement formalization** - Define the conjecture precisely\n2. **Simpler cases** - 1D, 2D topology\n3. **Prereq lemmas** - Parts of Ricci flow theory\n4. **Alternative proofs?** - Later simplifications of Perelman\n\n## Related Gallery Proofs\n\n| Proof | Relevance |\n|-------|-----------|\n| (none yet) | - |\n\n## Scouting Log\n\n### Initial Assessment: 2026-01-01\n\n**Current Status**: BLOCKED but uniquely interesting - theorem IS proven\n\n**Blocker Tracking**:\n| Infrastructure | In Mathlib | Last Checked |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Manifolds | Yes | 2026-01-01 |\n| 3-manifolds | Limited | 2026-01-01 |\n| Ricci curvature | Yes | 2026-01-01 |\n| Ricci flow | No | 2026-01-01 |\n| Surgery | No | 2026-01-01 |\n\n**Key Insight**: This is the only solved Millennium Problem. Formalizing it would be a landmark achievement.\n\n**Next Scout**: Watch for Ricci flow formalization efforts\n"
