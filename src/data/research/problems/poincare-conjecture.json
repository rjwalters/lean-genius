Grigori Perelman proved it in 2002-2003 using Richard Hamilton's Ricci flow program.\n\n### Core Statement\n\n> Every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere S³.\n\nIn simpler terms: If a 3-dimensional space is \"nice\" (closed, no boundary) and every loop can be continuously shrunk to a point (simply connected), then it must be topologically equivalent to the 3-sphere.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n1. **Topology Foundation**: Characterizes 3-dimensional spaces\n2. **Geometric Analysis**: Ricci flow is now a major tool\n3. **Historic Significance**: The only solved Millennium Problem\n4. **Formalizing Perelman**: Would be a landmark achievement\n\n## Historical Context\n\n| Year | Mathematician | Contribution |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1904 | Poincaré | Posed the conjecture |\n| 1960s | Smale, Stallings | Solved for dimensions ≥ 5 |\n| 1982 | Freedman | Solved for dimension 4 |\n| 1982 | Hamilton | Introduced Ricci flow |\n| 2002-03 | Perelman | Completed proof via Ricci flow with surgery |\n| 2006 | Verification | Detailed checking by multiple groups |\n\nPerelman famously declined both the Fields Medal and the $1 million Clay prize.\n\n## The Proof Strategy\n\n### Hamilton's Ricci Flow\n\nThe Ricci flow evolves a metric g(t) on a manifold by:\n\n∂g/∂t = -2 Ric(g)\n\nwhere Ric is the Ricci curvature tensor. This \"smooths out\" the geometry over time.\n\n### Perelman's Breakthrough\n\n1. **Entropy functionals** - Introduced W-functional and F-functional\n2. **No local collapsing** - Controlled degeneration\n3. **Surgery** - When singularities form, cut and cap\n4. **Extinction** - Manifold eventually becomes round or disappears\n\n### Why It Works in 3D\n\n- In 3D, Ricci flow tends to make things round\n- Hamilton showed spheres \"round out\" nicely\n- Perelman handled the singularities that form\n\n## What We Could Build\n\n### In Mathlib Now\n\n| Component | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Smooth manifolds | ✅ | Well-developed |\n| Riemannian metrics | ✅ | Available |\n| Ricci curvature | ✅ | Defined |\n| 3-manifolds | ⚠️ Limited | Basic definitions |\n| Ricci flow | ❌ | Not available |\n| Surgery | ❌ | Not available |\n\n### The Formalization Challenge\n\nFormalizing Perelman's proof would require:\n\n1. **Ricci flow PDE** (~2000 lines)\n   - Evolution equation\n   - Short-time existence\n   - Maximum principles\n\n2. **Singularity analysis** (~5000 lines)\n   - Blow-up limits\n   - κ-solutions classification\n   - Ancient solutions\n\n3. **Surgery procedure** (~3000 lines)\n   - Neck detection\n   - Standard caps\n   - Finite time surgery\n\n4. **Extinction argument** (~1000 lines)\n   - Finite extinction time\n   - Sphere recognition\n\nTotal estimate: **10,000+ lines** of specialized geometric analysis.\n\n## Tractable Partial Work\n\nEven without full Perelman, we could formalize:\n\n1. **The Statement**\n   - Define simply connected 3-manifolds\n   - State homeomorphism to S³\n\n2. **Ricci Flow Basics**\n   - Define the evolution equation\n   - Prove short-time existence (known techniques)\n\n3. **2D Case**\n   - 2D uniformization via Ricci flow\n   - Much simpler than 3D\n\n4. **Sphere Roundness**\n   - Hamilton's theorem: positively curved 3-manifolds become round\n   - No surgery needed in this case\n\n5. **Alternative Approaches**\n   - Thurston's geometrization (now proven via Perelman)\n   - Classifying 3-manifold geometries\n\n## The Bigger Picture: Geometrization\n\nPerelman actually proved more than Poincaré - he proved Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture:\n\n> Every 3-manifold can be cut along tori into pieces, each having one of 8 standard geometries.\n\nThis completely classifies 3-dimensional topology.\n\n## Key References\n\n- Poincaré, H. (1904). \"Fifth Supplement to Analysis Situs\"\n- Hamilton, R. (1982). \"Three-manifolds with positive Ricci curvature\"\n- Perelman, G. (2002). \"The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications\"\n- Perelman, G. (2003). \"Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds\"\n- Morgan, J., Tian, G. (2007). \"Ricci Flow and the Poincaré Conjecture\"\n\n## Why This Is Special\n\nThe Poincaré Conjecture is the **only Millennium Problem that's been solved**. Formalizing it would:\n\n1. **Validate Perelman's proof** mechanically\n2. **Create reusable Ricci flow library** for other geometric problems\n3. **Be a major achievement** in formal mathematics\n4. **Honor the proof** that its author declined to promote\n\n## Scouting Log\n\n### Assessment: 2026-01-01\n\n**Current Status**: BLOCKED but uniquely tractable - the theorem IS proven!\n\n**Blocker Tracking**:\n| Infrastructure | In Mathlib | Last Checked |\n|----------------|------------|--------------|\n| Manifolds | Yes | 2026-01-01 |\n| 3-manifolds | Limited | 2026-01-01 |\n| Ricci curvature | Yes | 2026-01-01 |\n| Ricci flow | No | 2026-01-01 |\n| Surgery theory | No | 2026-01-01 |\n\n**Key Insight**: Unlike other Millennium Problems, this one has a known proof. The question is pure formalization effort, not mathematical discovery.\n\n**Path Forward**:\n1. Start with Ricci flow basics\n2. Formalize 2D case as warmup\n3. Build surgery framework\n4. Eventually: full Perelman\n\n**Next Scout**: Watch for Ricci flow formalization efforts in any proof assistant\n"
