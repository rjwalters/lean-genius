    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness\n\n## Survey Summary (2026-01-24)\n\n**Status**: MATHEMATICALLY BLOCKED - 3D problem is a Millennium Prize Problem (OPEN)\n\n**Existing Formalization**: NavierStokes.lean (1869 lines)\n- 36 axioms, 0 sorries\n- 2D case proven (modulo Sobolev embedding)\n- 3D case CONDITIONAL on unproven conjecture\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe Navier-Stokes problem asks whether smooth, physically reasonable solutions exist for all time for the equations governing fluid flow in three dimensions.\n\n### Core Statement\n\n> In 3D, prove global existence and smoothness of Navier-Stokes solutions for all smooth initial data, or provide a counterexample showing finite-time blowup.\n\nThe equations describe how velocity and pressure of a fluid evolve:\n\n∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = ν∆u - ∇p + f\n∇·u = 0\n\nwhere u is velocity, p is pressure, ν is viscosity, and f is external force.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n1. **Fluid Dynamics**: Governs everything from weather to blood flow\n2. **Engineering**: Aircraft design, turbulence modeling, oceanography\n3. **Physics**: Fundamental understanding of fluids\n4. **Turbulence**: Connected to one of the last major unsolved physics problems\n\n## Historical Context\n\n| Year | Mathematician | Contribution |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1822 | Navier | Derived equations with molecular assumptions |\n| 1845 | Stokes | Rigorous continuum derivation |\n| 1934 | Leray | Weak solutions exist globally |\n| 1962 | Ladyzhenskaya | 2D global regularity |\n| 1977 | Scheffer | Partial regularity results |\n| 1982 | Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg | Singular set has dimension ≤ 1 |\n\nThe 3D problem remains open despite 90+ years of effort since Leray.\n\n## Existing Formalization Analysis\n\n### NavierStokes.lean Structure (1869 lines)\n\n| Part | Content |\n|------|--------|\n| I | Numerical constants (spectral gap, Faber-Krahn) |\n| II-X | 3D regularity framework, Type I/II blowup analysis |\n| X | 2D theorem (enstrophy decreasing → no blowup) |\n| XI | Axiom catalog with verification status |\n\n### Axiom Categories (36 total)\n\n| Category | Count | Description | Tractability |\n|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| A: Measure-theoretic | 3 | Integral bounds (E_loc ≤ E, etc.) | Needs Mathlib infrastructure |\n| B: PDE results | 3 | Published theorems (Faber-Krahn, Poincaré) | Needs Mathlib infrastructure |\n| C: Physical hypotheses | 2 | NS dynamics (stretching, concentration) | Published results |\n| D: Conjectures | 1 | **finite_bubble_concentration** | UNPROVEN MATH |\n\n### The Key Blocker\n\nThe axiom `finite_bubble_concentration` (Category D) is an **unproven mathematical conjecture**. This is the actual gap between known results and 3D regularity. No amount of Lean formalization can close this gap - it requires mathematical discovery.\n\n## The Key Difficulty: 3D vs 2D\n\n### 2D: Solved!\n\nIn 2D, global smooth solutions exist. Key facts:\n- Vorticity ω = curl(u) satisfies a nice transport equation\n- Enstrophy ∫|ω|² is bounded for all time\n- No vortex stretching term\n- Global regularity follows from energy estimates\n\n**Formalization status**: 2D theorem proven in NavierStokes.lean (enstrophy_bounded_2d)\n\n### 3D: Open\n\nIn 3D, the vortex stretching term (ω·∇)u can potentially cause:\n- Vorticity concentration\n- Energy cascade to small scales\n- Possible finite-time singularity\n\n**Formalization status**: 3D theorem CONDITIONAL on finite_bubble_concentration\n\n## Mathlib Infrastructure Status (2026-01-24)\n\n| Component | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Vector calculus | ✅ | div, curl, grad |\n| Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev | ✅ | Formalized 2024 (~3500 lines) |\n| Sobolev spaces W^{k,p}(Ω) | ❌ | Only inequality, not spaces |\n| Weak derivatives | ❌ | Not formalized |\n| General distributions | ❌ | Only tempered (Oct 2025) |\n| Aubin-Lions compactness | ❌ | Not formalized |\n| Parabolic PDE theory | ❌ | Not formalized |\n| Lebesgue spaces | ✅ | Well-developed |\n| Functional analysis | ✅ | Strong foundation |\n\n## Recommended Path Forward\n\n1. **Do NOT work on 3D problem** - it's mathematically open\n2. **Redirect to 2d-navier-stokes** - tractable formalization target\n3. **Build Sobolev infrastructure** if contributing to Mathlib ecosystem\n4. **Monitor mathematical literature** for progress on bubble concentration\n\n## Key References\n\n- Leray, J. (1934). \"Sur le mouvement d'un liquide visqueux\"\n- Ladyzhenskaya, O. (1969). \"The Mathematical Theory of Viscous Incompressible Flow\"\n- Caffarelli, L., Kohn, R., Nirenberg, L.

The existing formalization correctly models the state of knowledge. The blocking axiom `finite_bubble_concentration` is an unproven conjecture.\n\n**Recommendation**: Mark as blocked-mathematical and redirect effort to 2d-navier-stokes.\n"
