Is it true that for all $m\\geq n+k$\\[M(n,k) \\neq M(m,k)?\\] The Thue-Siegel theorem implies that, for fixed $k$, there are only finitely many $m,n$ such that $m\\geq n+k$ and $M(n,k)=M(m,k)$. In general, how many solutions does $M(n,k)=M(m,l)$ have when $m\\geq n+k$ and $l>1$? Erdős expects very few (and none when $l\\geq k$). The only solutions Erdős knew were $M(4,3)=M(13,2)$ and $M(3,4)=M(19,2)$. In [Er79d] Erdős conjectures the stronger fact that (aside from a finite number of exceptions) if $k>2$ and $m\\geq n+k$ then $\\prod_{i\\leq k}(n+i)$ and $\\prod_{i\\leq k}(m+i)$ cannot have the same set of prime factors. See also [678], [686], and [850]. This is discussed in problem B35 of Guy's collection [Gu04].
