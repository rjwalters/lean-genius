    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: Sum of Divisors Properties\n\n## Status: Covered Elsewhere\n\nThis problem is marked **SKIPPED** because related content already exists in the proof gallery.\n\n## What We Have\n\n### In PerfectNumbers.lean (~317 lines)\n\nThe `PerfectNumbers.lean` file formalizes the sum-of-divisors function and its properties:\n\n**Definitions**:\n- Uses Mathlib's `Nat.divisors` and summation\n\n**Key Theorems**:\n- `sigma_prime_power`: σ(p^k) = (p^{k+1} - 1)/(p - 1)\n- `sigma_two_power`: σ(2^k) = 2^{k+1} - 1\n- `perfect_iff_sigma_2n`: n is perfect ⟺ σ(n) = 2n\n- `euclid_euler_perfect`: Euclid-Euler theorem for even perfect numbers\n\n**Concrete Examples**:\n- 6 is perfect (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)\n- 28 is perfect (1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28)\n- 496 is perfect\n- 8128 is perfect\n\n### In Mathlib\n\nThe divisor sum function is `Nat.sigma` in Mathlib:\n- `Nat.sigma 1 n` = σ(n) = sum of divisors of n\n- `Nat.sigma k n` = σ_k(n) = sum of k-th powers of divisors\n\n## Why This Problem Is Marked Skipped\n\nThe original problem statement was general \"sum of divisors properties\" without specific goals. Since our PerfectNumbers.lean already covers:\n1. The σ function behavior\n2. Perfect number characterization\n3. Euclid-Euler theorem\n\n...there's no clear additional target that would justify a separate research track.\n\n## Related Open Problems\n\nIf we wanted to extend this work, possible directions include:\n\n### 1. Odd Perfect Numbers\n**Status**: Open for 2000+ years!\n\nNo odd perfect number is known. If one exists, it must:\n- Be greater than 10^1500\n- Have at least 101 prime factors (counting multiplicity)\n- Have a special form involving prime powers\n\n### 2. Mersenne Primes Connection\n\nA number 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) is perfect iff 2^p - 1 is prime (Mersenne prime).\n\nKnown: M_2, M_3, M_5, M_7, M_13, M_17, M_19, M_31, ...\n\n### 3. Aliquot Sequences\n\nFor a number n, define a(n) = σ(n) - n (sum of proper divisors).\nThe sequence n → a(n) → a(a(n)) → ...\n\n- Perfect numbers: fixed points\n- Amicable numbers: 2-cycles\n- Sociable numbers: longer cycles\n- Open: Does every sequence eventually cycle or reach 1?\n\n### 4. Abundancy Index\n\nThe abundancy index σ(n)/n measures how \"abundant\" n is:\n- σ(n)/n < 2: deficient\n- σ(n)/n = 2: perfect\n- σ(n)/n > 2: abundant\n\nOpen questions about the distribution of abundancy.\n\n## References\n\n- Dickson, L.E. (1919). \"History of the Theory of Numbers\" Vol I\n- Guy, R.K. (2004). \"Unsolved Problems in Number Theory\" Section B\n- Ochem, P., Rao, M. (2012). \"Odd perfect numbers are greater than 10^1500\"\n\n## Scouting Log\n\n### Backfill Session (2026-01-01)\n\n**Mode**: BACKFILL - Related work exists in PerfectNumbers.lean\n\n**Decision**: Mark as SKIPPED since core σ function properties are already formalized. No specific open problem identified that would benefit from additional research effort.\n\n**If Revisiting**: Consider odd perfect number bounds or aliquot sequence properties as potential targets.\n"
