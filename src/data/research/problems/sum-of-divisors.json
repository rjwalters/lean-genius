    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: Sum of Divisors Properties\n\n## Status: SKIPPED (Confirmed 2026-01-24)\n\nThis problem is correctly marked SKIPPED because:\n1. PerfectNumbers.lean provides complete coverage (202 lines, no sorries)\n2. Mathlib's ArithmeticFunction.sigma covers σ_k functions\n3. Odd perfect numbers are mathematically OPEN (2000+ years)\n4. No tractable extension identified\n\n## What We Have\n\n### PerfectNumbers.lean (202 lines)\n\nImports `Archive.Wiedijk100Theorems.PerfectNumbers` from Mathlib:\n\n**Theorems**:\n- `perfect_iff_divisor_sum`: n perfect ↔ σ(n) = 2n\n- `sigma_two_pow`: σ(2^k) = 2^{k+1} - 1\n- `euclid_perfect_numbers`: Mersenne prime → perfect number\n- `euler_even_perfect`: Even perfect → Mersenne form\n- `even_perfect_iff`: Complete characterization\n\n**Examples**:\n- `six_is_perfect`: 6 = 2^1 × 3\n- `twentyeight_is_perfect`: 28 = 2^2 × 7\n- `fourhundredninetysix_is_perfect`: 496 = 2^4 × 31\n- `eightthousandonetwentyeight_is_perfect`: 8128 = 2^6 × 127\n\n### In Mathlib\n\n- `Nat.sigma 1 n` = σ(n) = sum of divisors\n- `Nat.sigma k n` = σ_k(n) = sum of k-th powers of divisors\n- `ArithmeticFunction.IsMultiplicative σ` - σ is multiplicative\n\n## Potential Extensions (Not Tractable)\n\n### 1. Odd Perfect Numbers\n**Status**: OPEN for 2000+ years!\n\nNo odd perfect number is known. If one exists:\n- Must be > 10^1500\n- Must have at least 101 prime factors\n- Must have special form\n\n**Why Not Tractable**: This is a mathematical problem, not a formalization problem.\n\n### 2. Aliquot Sequences\n\nFor n, define a(n) = σ(n) - n (proper divisor sum).\nThe sequence n → a(n) → a(a(n)) → ...\n\n- Perfect: fixed points (a(6) = 6)\n- Amicable: 2-cycles (a(220) = 284, a(284) = 220)\n- Sociable: longer cycles\n\n**Open**: Does every sequence eventually cycle or reach 1?\n\n### 3. Related Erdős Problems\n\nSeveral Erdős problems use σ - these are tracked separately:\n- Erdős #48: φ(n) = σ(m) pairs (SOLVED)\n- Erdős #250, #252, #277, #412, etc.\n\n## Survey Log\n\n### Assessment: 2026-01-24 (researcher-3)\n\n**Decision**: SKIP CONFIRMED\n\n**Reason**: PerfectNumbers.lean is complete with no sorries. It imports the authoritative Wiedijk100Theorems from Mathlib and provides pedagogical wrappers. No tractable extension identified - odd perfect numbers are mathematically open, not a formalization gap.\n\n**Recommendation**: Keep skipped. Related Erdős problems tracked separately.\n"
