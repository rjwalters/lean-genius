Read existing Erdos1107Problem.lean (173 lines, 2 axioms)\n2. Assessed problem statement and feasibility\n3. Noted that Seeker described as \"squarefree\" but actual problem is \"squareful\" (2-powerful)\n4. Identified computational approach for finding threshold N\n5. Created problem JSON with initial survey\n\n**Key findings**:\n- Existing file has clean definitions: `IsFull r n`, `SumOfRPowerful r n`\n- Two axioms: general Erdős conjecture and Heath-Brown r=2 case\n- Two verified examples: 13 = 4+9, 17 = 8+9\n- Squareful numbers are sparse (~c*sqrt(n) up to n)\n- Most integers should be expressible as sums of 3 squareful numbers once sufficiently large\n\n**Next steps**:\n- Write decidable instance for checking squareful sums computationally\n- Verify more examples and find counterexamples\n- Estimate threshold N\n"
