    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: Riemann Hypothesis\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe Riemann Hypothesis (RH) is arguably the most famous unsolved problem in mathematics. Proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, it concerns the distribution of prime numbers.\n\n### Core Statement\n\n> All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) have real part equal to 1/2.\n\nIn simpler terms: The zeta function ζ(s) = 1 + 1/2^s + 1/3^s + 1/4^s + ... has zeros at negative even integers (-2, -4, -6, ...) called \"trivial zeros.\" All other zeros are conjectured to lie on the \"critical line\" where Re(s) = 1/2.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n1. **Prime Distribution**: RH implies the best possible error term for the prime counting function π(x)\n2. **Cryptography**: Many cryptographic systems rely on assumptions about prime distribution\n3. **Number Theory**: Hundreds of theorems are proven \"assuming RH\"\n4. **L-functions**: RH generalizes to a vast family of L-functions (Generalized Riemann Hypothesis)\n\n## Historical Context\n\n| Year | Mathematician | Contribution |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1859 | Riemann | Original paper stating the hypothesis |\n| 1896 | Hadamard, de la Vallée Poussin | Proved Prime Number Theorem (weaker than RH) |\n| 1914 | Hardy | Infinitely many zeros on critical line |\n| 1942 | Selberg | Positive proportion of zeros on critical line |\n| 2004 | Gourdon | First 10^13 zeros verified computationally |\n\nThe problem has resisted proof for over 165 years despite intense effort by the world's best mathematicians.\n\n## What We've Built\n\n### In This Repository\n\nThe `rh-consequences.lean` file (~632 lines) formalizes results *assuming* RH:\n- `RH_implies_prime_gap_bound` - Prime gap bounds from RH\n- `explicit_formula` - Connection between zeros and primes\n- `zeta_special_values` - ζ(2), ζ(4), etc.\n- `Li_criterion` - Equivalent formulation via Li coefficients\n\n### In Mathlib\n\n| Component | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Complex exponentials | ✅ | Full support |\n| Dirichlet series | ⚠️ Partial | Basic framework exists |\n| Riemann zeta ζ(s) | ❌ | Not defined |\n| Analytic continuation | ❌ | Not available |\n| L-functions | ❌ | Not available |\n\n## Formalization Challenges\n\n### Primary Blocker: Zeta Function Infrastructure\n\nDefining ζ(s) rigorously requires:\n1. **Initial definition**: ζ(s) = Σ n^(-s) for Re(s) > 1\n2. **Analytic continuation**: Extending to all s ≠ 1\n3. **Functional equation**: ζ(s) = 2^s π^(s-1) sin(πs/2) Γ(1-s) ζ(1-s)\n4. **Zeros**: Defining and locating non-trivial zeros\n\nThis infrastructure represents thousands of lines of formalization work.\n\n### What We Could Still Do\n\nEven without proving RH, tractable partial work includes:\n\n1. **RH Consequences** (done in rh-consequences.lean)\n   - Prove theorems *assuming* RH as an axiom\n   - Formalizes the implications of RH\n\n2. **Computational Verification**\n   - State that first N zeros are verified to be on critical line\n   - Connect to Gourdon's verification of 10^13 zeros\n\n3. **Equivalent Formulations**\n   - Li's criterion (already in our file)\n   - Weil's explicit formula\n   - Random matrix theory connections\n\n4. **Zero-Free Regions**\n   - Classical Hadamard-de la Vallée Poussin region\n   - Korobov-Vinogradov improvements\n\n## Related Work in This Repository\n\n| File | Relevance |\n|------|-----------|\n| `rh-consequences.lean` | Consequences assuming RH |\n| `ChebyshevBounds.lean` | Prime counting bounds (weaker than RH) |\n| `prime-gaps-explicit` | Related to prime distribution |\n\n## Key References\n\n- Riemann, B.

The work we're doing now (assuming RH) will integrate naturally once ζ(s) is available.\n\n**Next Scout**: After major Mathlib release or when analytic number theory PR lands\n"
