Can one prove this is false if we replace $k^2+1$ by $e^{(1+\\epsilon)\\sqrt{k}}+C_\\epsilon$, for all $\\epsilon>0$, where $C_\\epsilon>0$ is some constant? This follows from 'plausible assumptions on the distribution of primes' (as does the question with $k^2$ replaced by $k^d$ for any $d$); the challenge is to prove this unconditionally. Erdős observed that Cramer's conjecture\\[\\limsup_{k\\to \\infty} \\frac{p_{k+1}-p_k}{(\\log k)^2}=1\\]implies that for all $\\epsilon>0$ and all sufficiently large $n$ there exists some $k$ such that\\[p(n+k)>e^{(1-\\epsilon)\\sqrt{k}}.\\]There is now evidence, however, that Cramer's conjecture is false; a more refined heuristic by Granville [Gr95] suggests this $\\limsup$ is $2e^{-\\gamma}\\approx 1.119\\cdots$, and so perhaps the $1+\\epsilon$ in the second question should be replaced by $2e^{-\\gamma}+\\epsilon$.
