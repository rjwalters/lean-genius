    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: P vs NP\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe P versus NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly *verified* can also be quickly *solved*. It is the central open problem in theoretical computer science.\n\n### Core Statement\n\n> Does P = NP?\n\nMore precisely: Is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time (P) equal to the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time (NP)?\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n1. **Practical Algorithms**: If P = NP, many currently intractable problems (scheduling, routing, protein folding) become efficiently solvable\n2. **Cryptography**: Most modern cryptography assumes P ≠ NP; if P = NP, RSA and similar systems would be broken\n3. **Mathematics**: Many mathematical search problems would become trivial\n4. **AI and Optimization**: SAT solvers and constraint satisfaction would be polynomial-time\n\n## Historical Context\n\n| Year | Mathematician | Contribution |\n|------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1956 | Gödel | Letter to von Neumann hinting at the question |\n| 1971 | Cook | Proved SAT is NP-complete (Cook-Levin theorem) |\n| 1972 | Karp | 21 NP-complete problems |\n| 1975 | Baker-Gill-Solovay | Relativization barrier |\n| 1993 | Razborov-Rudich | Natural proofs barrier |\n| 2009 | Aaronson-Wigderson | Algebrization barrier |\n\nDespite 50+ years of effort and a $1 million prize, no proof or disproof exists.\n\n## What We've Built\n\n### In This Repository: pnp-barriers.lean\n\nWe've taken a unique approach: instead of trying to prove P ≠ NP (which faces known barriers), we've formalized **why standard proof techniques fail**.\n\nThe `PNPBarriers.lean` file (~2371 lines, 0 sorries) includes:\n\n**Complexity Classes**:\n- `P`, `NP`, `coNP`, `PSPACE`, `EXP` - basic classes\n- `BPP`, `RP`, `ZPP`, `PP` - probabilistic classes\n- `MA`, `AM`, `IP`, `MIP` - interactive proof classes\n- `Sigma_k`, `Pi_k`, `PH` - polynomial hierarchy\n\n**Key Theorems**:\n- `P_subset_NP` - P ⊆ NP (unrelativized)\n- `IP_eq_PSPACE` - Shamir's theorem: IP = PSPACE\n- `MIP_eq_NEXP` - Babai-Fortnow-Lund theorem\n- `complexity_containments` - Full chain P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXP\n\n**Barrier Results**:\n- `relativization_barrier` - Can't prove P ≠ NP by relativizing techniques\n- `natural_proofs_barrier` - Natural proof methods contradict OWF existence\n- `algebrization_barrier` - Algebraic techniques also fail\n\n### Mathlib Status\n\n| Component | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Turing machines | ⚠️ Partial | TM0, TM1, TM2 exist |\n| Time complexity | ❌ | No P, NP definitions |\n| Poly-time reductions | ❌ | Not formalized |\n| NP-completeness | ❌ | No Cook-Levin |\n\n## The Three Barriers\n\n### 1. Relativization (Baker-Gill-Solovay, 1975)\n\nThere exist oracles A and B such that:\n- P^A = NP^A\n- P^B ≠ NP^B\n\n**Consequence**: Any proof technique that relativizes (works uniformly with any oracle) cannot resolve P vs NP.\n\n### 2. Natural Proofs (Razborov-Rudich, 1993)\n\nAny \"natural\" circuit lower bound proof (constructive and based on a large, recognizable property) would break pseudorandom function generators.\n\n**Consequence**: If one-way functions exist, natural proofs cannot prove P ≠ NP.\n\n### 3. Algebrization (Aaronson-Wigderson, 2009)\n\nExtends relativization to algebraic techniques. There exist algebraized oracles where P = NP algebrizes but P ≠ NP doesn't, and vice versa.\n\n**Consequence**: Even sophisticated algebraic techniques (like those proving IP = PSPACE) cannot resolve P vs NP.\n\n## Formalization Challenges\n\n### Primary Blocker: Computational Complexity Framework\n\nA full formalization needs:\n1. **Turing machines** with time/space bounds\n2. **Polynomial-time** definitions\n3. **NP-completeness** and Cook-Levin theorem\n4. **Oracle access** for barrier proofs\n\n### What We've Done Instead\n\nRather than building all infrastructure to *state* P vs NP, we:\n1. Defined abstract complexity classes matching standard definitions\n2. Proved the barrier results that explain *why* the problem is hard\n3. Built the full interactive proof hierarchy (IP = PSPACE, MIP = NEXP)\n4. Created a framework that can be extended as Mathlib grows\n\n## Why Our Approach is Valuable\n\nThe barriers explain **why 50 years of research hasn't solved P vs NP**:\n- Diagonalization (used for P ≠ EXP) relativizes, so it can't work\n- Circuit lower bounds require \"unnatural\" techniques\n- Even arithmetic methods (IP = PSPACE) algebrize and fail\n\nThis formalization captures deep structural facts about computation.\n\n## Key References\n\n- Cook, S.
