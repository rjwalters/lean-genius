They constructed a basis with r_A(n) ≥ t that cannot be partitioned.\n\n2. **Erdős-Nathanson (1989)**: Showed partition IS possible when\nr_A(n) > c log n for c > (log 4/3)^{-1} ≈ 3.48.\n\n3. **Larsen (2026)**: The full conjecture (r_A(n) → ∞) is also FALSE.\n\n### The Gap\n\nThe conjecture asked about r_A(n) → ∞, which lies between:\n- r_A(n) ≥ t (fixed t) — counterexample exists\n- r_A(n) > c log n — partition possible\n\nLarsen showed that r_A(n) → ∞ is not fast enough growth to guarantee partition.\n\n## Sessions\n\n### Session 2026-01-14 - Initial Formalization\n\n**Mode**: REVISIT\n**Outcome**: Complete formalization\n\n#### What I Did\n- Defined representation function r_A(n) as ncard of pairs summing to n\n- Defined sumset and additive basis predicates\n- Proved equivalence of two basis definitions\n- Axiomatized Erdős-Nathanson results (weak and positive)\n- Axiomatized Larsen counterexample\n- Proved blocking_prevents_partition explicitly\n- Proved erdos_871_disproved from axioms\n\n#### Key Findings\n- Problem was DISPROVED in 2026 by Daniel Larsen\n- AI-assisted proof (Claude Opus 4.5)\n- Clean formalization with ~240 lines\n- Blocking property is key mechanism\n\n#### Files Modified\n- proofs/Proofs/Erdos871Problem.lean (new, ~240 lines)\n\n---\n\n*Generated 2026-01-14*\n"
