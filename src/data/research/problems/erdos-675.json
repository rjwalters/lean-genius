If we partition all primes into $P\\sqcup Q$, such that each set contains $\\gg x/\\log x$ many primes $\\leq x$ for all large $x$, then can the set of integers only divisible by primes from $P$ have the translation property? If $A$ is the set of squarefree numbers then how fast does the minimal such $t_n$ grow? Is it true that $t_n>\\exp(n^c)$ for some constant $c>0$? Elementary sieve theory implies that the set of squarefree numbers has the translation property. More generally, Brun's sieve can be used to prove that if $B\\subseteq \\mathbb{N}$ is a set of pairwise coprime integers with $\\sum_{b View the LaTeX source\n\n## Status\n\n**Erdős Database Status**: OPEN\n\n**Tractability Score**: 4/10\n**Aristotle Suitable**: No\n\n## Tags\n\n- erdos\n\n## Related Problems\n\n- Problem #337\n- Problem #2000\n- Problem #60\n- Problem #674\n- Problem #676\n- Problem #2\n- Problem #39\n- Problem #1\n\n## References\n\n- Er79\n\n## Sessions\n\n(No research sessions yet)\n\n---\n\n*Generated from erdosproblems.com on 2026-01-14*\n"
