The dichromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\\delta(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ of colours required such that, in any orientation of the edges of $G$, there is a $k$-colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that there are no monochromatic oriented cycles.\n\nMust a graph with large chromatic number have large dichromatic number? Must a graph with large cochromatic number contain a graph with large dichromatic number?\n\n\n\nThe first question is due to Erd\\H{o}s and Neumann-Lara. The second question is due to Erd\\H{o}s and Gimbel. A positive answer to the second question implies a positive answer to the first via the bound mentioned in [760].",
