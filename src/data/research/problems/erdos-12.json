    "markdown": "# Erdős #12 - Knowledge Base\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nLet A be an infinite set with no distinct a,b,c ∈ A such that a | (b+c) and b,c > a.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. Can A achieve liminf |A ∩ {1,...,N}| / √N > 0?\n2. Is there c > 0 with |A| < N^(1-c) infinitely often?\n3. Must Σ(1/n : n ∈ A) < ∞?\n\n## Status\n\n**Erdős Database Status**: OPEN\n\n## Session Log\n\n### Session 2026-01-15 - Density Bounds\n\n**Mode**: REVISIT\n**Outcome**: PROGRESS\n\n#### What I Did\n1. Added `infinitely_many_primes_3mod4` axiom (Dirichlet's theorem)\n2. Added `primeSquares3mod4_infinite` axiom deriving infinitude of example set\n3. Added `primeSquares3mod4_is_good` theorem combining infinitude and divisibility-free properties\n4. Added `primeSquares3mod4_density` axiom (√N / log N lower bound)\n5. Added `primeSquares3mod4_liminf_pos` axiom matching formal-conjectures statement\n\n#### Key Insight\nThe density of `primeSquares3mod4` is ~√N / log N, which comes from:\n- Primes ≡ 3 (mod 4) up to x: ~x / (2 log x) by PNT in arithmetic progressions\n- Their squares up to N: primes up to √N\n- So count ≈ √N / (2 log √N) = √N / log N\n\nThis is less than √N but still substantial.\n\n### Session 2026-01-14 - Bug Fix\n\n**Mode**: REVISIT\n**Outcome**: PROGRESS\n\n#### Key Discovery\n\nThe theorem `powersOfTwo_divisibility_free` was **FALSE**. Powers of 2 do NOT form a divisibility-free set!\n\n**Counterexample**: a=2, b=4, c=8\n- 2 | (4 + 8) = 2 | 12 = True ✗ (violates divisibility-free property)\n\n#### What I Did\n1. Replaced with `powersOfTwo_not_divisibility_free` proving the negation\n2. Proved `primeSquares3mod4_divisibility_free` using quadratic reciprocity\n"
