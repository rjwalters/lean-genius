    "markdown": "# Knowledge Base: Yang-Mills Existence and Mass Gap\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe Yang-Mills problem asks for a rigorous mathematical foundation for quantum field theory - specifically, proving that the strong nuclear force has a \"mass gap.\"\n\n### Core Statement\n\n> Prove that for any compact simple gauge group G, a non-trivial quantum Yang-Mills theory exists on R⁴ and has a mass gap Δ > 0.\n\nThe mass gap means the lightest particle in the theory has positive mass - there are no massless particles besides the vacuum.\n\n### Why It Matters\n\n1. **Physics Foundation**: Explains why nuclear force is short-range\n2. **Quantum Field Theory**: Would put QFT on rigorous mathematical footing\n3. **Standard Model**: Yang-Mills is the framework for particle physics\n4. **Confinement**: Related to why quarks are never seen in isolation\n\n## Historical Context\n\n| Year | Physicist/Mathematician | Contribution |\n|------|------------------------|--------------|\n| 1954 | Yang, Mills | Introduced non-abelian gauge theories |\n| 1960s | Glashow, Weinberg, Salam | Electroweak unification |\n| 1973 | Gross, Wilczek, Politzer | Asymptotic freedom in QCD |\n| 1974 | Wilson | Lattice gauge theory formulation |\n| 2000 | Clay Institute | Named as Millennium Problem |\n\nThe theory works phenomenally well for physics - the issue is mathematical rigor.\n\n## What This Means\n\n### Yang-Mills Theory (Classical)\n\nThe classical Yang-Mills equations are:\n- D*F = 0 (Yang-Mills equation)\n- DF = 0 (Bianchi identity)\n\nwhere F is the curvature of a connection A on a principal G-bundle, and D is the covariant derivative.\n\n### Quantum Yang-Mills\n\nQuantizing this theory means:\n1. Defining a probability measure on field configurations\n2. Making sense of path integrals\n3. Proving existence in the continuum limit\n4. Showing the mass gap property\n\n### The Mass Gap\n\nIf the theory exists, the Hamiltonian H has:\n- Ground state energy E₀ = 0 (vacuum)\n- First excited state energy E₁ > 0\n- Mass gap Δ = E₁ - E₀ > 0\n\nThis explains why nuclear force is short-range (unlike electromagnetism).\n\n## What We Could Build\n\n### In Mathlib Now\n\n| Component | Status | Notes |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Lie groups | ✅ | Well-developed |\n| Principal bundles | ⚠️ Partial | Building |\n| Connections | ⚠️ Partial | Some foundations |\n| Curvature | ⚠️ Partial | Riemannian case |\n| QFT axioms | ❌ | Not available |\n| Path integrals | ❌ | Not available |\n\n### Tractable Partial Work\n\n1. **Classical Yang-Mills**\n   - Define connections on principal bundles\n   - State classical Yang-Mills equations\n   - Prove basic gauge-theoretic facts\n\n2. **2D Yang-Mills** (Exactly Solvable)\n   - In 2D, the theory is exactly solvable\n   - Migdal's formula gives explicit answers\n   - Much simpler than 4D\n\n3. **Lattice Gauge Theory**\n   - Wilson's discrete approximation\n   - Well-defined mathematically\n   - Convergence to continuum is the hard part\n\n4. **Gauge Group Theory**\n   - SU(2), SU(3) structures\n   - Representation theory\n   - Lie algebra aspects\n\n## The Mathematical Challenges\n\n### Primary Blocker: Rigorous QFT\n\nConstructive QFT is one of mathematics' hardest problems:\n\n1. **Functional integrals** - \"∫ e^{-S[φ]} Dφ\" isn't defined rigorously\n2. **Renormalization** - Removing infinities consistently\n3. **Continuum limit** - Lattice → continuous space\n4. **Non-perturbative effects** - Can't just Taylor expand\n\n### What Constructive QFT Has Achieved\n\n| Theory | Dimension | Status |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| φ⁴ | 2D | Constructed |\n| φ⁴ | 3D | Constructed |\n| φ⁴ | 4D | Not constructed |\n| Pure Yang-Mills | 2D | Constructed |\n| Pure Yang-Mills | 4D | Not constructed |\n\nThe 4D case is qualitatively harder.\n\n## Why This Is So Hard\n\n1. **Non-abelian** - Unlike electromagnetism, gluons interact with each other\n2. **4 dimensions** - Critical dimension where UV divergences are marginal\n3. **Asymptotic freedom** - Easy at high energy, hard at low energy\n4. **Confinement** - Non-perturbative phenomenon\n\nEven defining what \"quantum Yang-Mills\" means requires substantial work.\n\n## Related Physics\n\nThe mass gap is connected to:\n- **Quark confinement** - Why we never see free quarks\n- **Glueballs** - Bound states of gluons (predicted but hard to detect)\n- **Asymptotic freedom** - Interaction weakens at high energy\n\n## Key References\n\n- Yang, C.N., Mills, R.

Classical Yang-Mills on principal bundles\n2. 2D Yang-Mills (exactly solvable case)\n3. Lattice gauge theory foundations\n4. Long-term: constructive QFT\n\n**Reality Check**: This is arguably the hardest Millennium Problem mathematically. Even stating it precisely requires substantial infrastructure.\n\n**Next Scout**: Long-term project - QFT formalization is a major undertaking\n"
