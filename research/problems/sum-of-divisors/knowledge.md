# Knowledge Base: sum-of-divisors

## Problem Summary

Formalize sum of divisors function properties.

## Current State

**Status**: SKIPPED (ALREADY COVERED)

### Why Skipped

Already covered by `PerfectNumbers.lean` which has:
- sigma(2^k) computations
- Euclid-Euler theorem for even perfect numbers
- Concrete examples (6, 28, 496, 8128)

### What Exists

The divisor sum function is in Mathlib as `Nat.sigma`. Our PerfectNumbers.lean uses it.

This problem was marked "skipped" but related content exists.
