Let $f_r(n)$ be maximal such that, if a graph $G$ has the property that every subgraph $H$ on $m$ vertices is the union of a graph with chromatic number $r$ and a graph with $\leq f_r(m)$ edges, then $G$ has chromatic number $\leq r+1$.

Is it true that $f_2(n) \gg n$? More generally, is $f_r(n)\gg_r n$?



A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di. This seems to be closely related to, but distinct from, [744].

Tang notes in the comments that a construction of R\"{o}dl \cite{Ro82} disproves the first question, so that $f_2(n)\not\gg n$.
