## Problem Understanding

OQ-03 asks whether Tao's 2019 almost-all result (logarithmic density 1) can be
formalized in Lean with Mathlib. Tao (2019, *Forum Math. Pi*): for every
`f : ℕ → ℝ` with `f n → ∞`, the set `{n : Col_min(n) < f n}` has **logarithmic
density 1**. This subsumes Terras (1976) / Korec (1994) (almost all n have finite
stopping time, in natural density).

## Insights

- **Statement formalizes cleanly.** "Logarithmic density 1" becomes the predicate
  `HasLogDensityOne S := Tendsto (fun N => (∑_{n≤N,n∈S} 1/n)/(∑_{n≤N} 1/n)) atTop (𝓝 1)`.
  `Set.indicator` (classical, no `DecidablePred` needed) handles the filtered sum.
  Tao's theorem is then a single clean `axiom tao_2019` quantified over all `f → ∞`.
- **The elementary half is axiom-free.** Even numbers drop in one step
  (`collatz n = n/2 < n`), and powers of two collapse to 1
  (`collatz^[k] (2^k) = 1`, induction via `collatz (2·m) = m` + `pow_succ'` +
  `Function.iterate_succ_apply`). These give explicit large families in the
  almost-all set without any analysis.
- **Orbit minimum** `colMin n := sInf {m | ∃ k, collatz^[k] n = m}`; `colMin_le_self`
  is just `Nat.sInf_le ⟨0, Function.iterate_zero_apply ..⟩`.

## Dead Ends / Blockers

- **Full proof of Tao (2019) is BLOCKED.** The proof evolves tuned measures on the
  3-adics and controls their concentration (a transport estimate) plus a
  Fourier-analytic input — none present in Mathlib. A direct formalization is a
  multi-thousand-line project, not a near-term target. So the file states the
  theorem as an axiom and proves only the independent elementary content.
- Suggested intermediate milestone: formalize the Terras/Korec *natural*-density
  stopping-time result first (easier than the logarithmic-density sharpening).
