# Problem: Erdős #159

## Statement

### Plain Language
There exists some constant $c>0$ such that

$$R(C_4,K_n) \ll n^{2-c}.$$



The current bounds are\[ \frac{n^{3/2}}{(\log n)^{3/2}}\ll R(C_4,K_n)\ll \frac{n^2}{(\log n)^2}.\]The upper bound is due to Szemer\'{e}di (mentioned in \cite{EFRS78}), and the lower bound is due to Spencer \cite{Sp77}.

This problem is #17 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.
