Is there a graph of chromatic number $\aleph_1$ such that for all $\epsilon>0$ if $n$ is sufficiently large and $H$ is a subgraph on $n$ vertices then $H$ contains an independent set of size $>n^{1-\epsilon}$?



Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{EHS82}. In \cite{Er95d} Erd\H{o}s suggests this may even be true with an independent set of size $\gg n$.

See also [750].
