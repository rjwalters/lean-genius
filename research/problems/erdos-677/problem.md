# Problem: Erdős #677

## Statement

### Plain Language
Let $M(n,k)=[n+1,\ldots,n+k]$ be the least common multiple of $\{n+1,\ldots,n+k\}$. Is it true that for all $m\geq n+k$\[M(n,k) \neq M(m,k)?\] The Thue-Siegel theorem implies that, for fixed $k$, there are only finitely many $m,n$ such that $m\geq n+k$ and $M(n,k)=M(m,k)$. In general, how many solutions does $M(n,k)=M(m,l)$ have when $m\geq n+k$ and $l>1$? Erdős expects very few (and none when $l\geq k$). The only solutions Erdős knew were $M(4,3)=M(13,2)$ and $M(3,4)=M(19,2)$. In [Er79d] Erd...
