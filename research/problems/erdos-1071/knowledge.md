Are there a finite set of unit line segments in the unit square, no two of which intersect, which are maximal with respect to this property?

Is there a region $R$ with a maximal set of disjoint unit line segments that is countably infinite?



A question of Erd\H{o}s and T\'{o}th. The answer to the first question is yes (which Erd\H{o}s gave \$10 for).

There are two examples Erd\H{o}s gives in \cite{Er87b}, the {IMAGE=1071-one,first} by Danzer, the {IMAGE=1071-two,second} by an unnamed participant.
