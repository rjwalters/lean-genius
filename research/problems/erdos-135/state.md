# Current State

**Phase**: EXPLORATION
**Since**: 2026-01-14T00:00:00Z
**Iteration**: 1

## Current Focus

Formalization complete. Problem is DISPROVED by Tao 2024.

## Active Approach

Full formalization with axiomatized main theorem and supporting lemmas.

## Blockers

None - problem is solved. Sorries are for helper lemmas (distance counting, examples).

## Next Action

Consider proving explicit examples (square has 2 distances, rhombus has 3, etc.)
