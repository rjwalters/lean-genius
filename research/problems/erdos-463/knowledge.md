Is there a function $f$ with $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$ such that, for all large $n$, there is a composite number $m$ such that\[n+f(n)<m<n+p(m)?\](Here $p(m)$ is the least prime factor of $m$.)



In \cite{Er92e} Erd\H{o}s asks about\[F(n)=\min_{m>n}(m-p(m)),\]and whether $n-F(n)\sim cn^{1/2}$ for some $c>0$.

See also [385].
