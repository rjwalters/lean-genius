Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$ be such that no circle whose centre is one of the $x_i$ contains three other points. Are there at least\[(1+c)\frac{n}{2}\]distinct distances determined between the $x_i$, for some constant $c>0$ and all $n$ sufficiently large?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Pach. It is easy to see that this assumption implies that there are at least $\frac{n-1}{2}$ distinct distances determined by every point.

Zach Hunter has observed that taking $n$ points equally spaced on a circle disproves this conjecture. In the spirit of related conjectures of Erd\H{o}s and others, presumably some kind of assumption that the points are in general position (e.g. no three on a line and no four on a circle) was intended.
