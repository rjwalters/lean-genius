Consider the triangular lattice with minimal distance between two points $1$. Denote by $f(t)$ the number of distances from any points $\leq t$. For example $f(1)=6$, $f(\sqrt{3})=12$, and $f(3)=18$.

Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$ be such that $d(x_i,x_j)\geq 1$ for all $i\neq j$. Is it true that, provided $n$ is sufficiently large depending on $t$, the number of distances $d(x_i,x_j)\leq t$ is less than or equal to $f(t)$ with equality perhaps only for the triangular lattice?

In particular, is it true that the number of distances $\leq \sqrt{3}-\epsilon$ is less than $1$?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Lov\'{a}sz, and Vesztergombi.

This is essentially verbatim the problem description in \cite{Er97e}, but this does not make sense as written; there must be at least one typo. Suggestions about what this problem intends are welcome.

Erd\H{o}s also goes on to write 'Perhaps the following stronger conjecture holds: Let $t_1<t_2<\cdots$ be the set of distances occurring in the triangular lattice. $t_1=1$ $t_2=\sqrt{3}$ $t_3=3$ $t_4=5$ etc. Is it true that there is an $\epsilon_n$ so that for every set $y_1,\ldots,$ with $d(y_i,y_j)\geq 1$ the number of distances $d(y_i,y_j)<t_n$ is less than $f(t_n)$?'

Again, this is nonsense interpreted literally; I am not sure what Erd\H{o}s intended.
