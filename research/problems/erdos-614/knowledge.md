# Erdős #614 - Knowledge Base

## Problem Statement

Let f(n,k)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n,k)f(n,k)f(n,k) be minimal such that there is a graph with n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">nnn vertices and f(n,k)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n,k)f(n,k)f(n,k) edges where every set of k+2" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">k+2k+2k+2 vertices induces a subgraph with maximum degree at least k" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">kkk. Determine f(n,k)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n,k)f(n,k)f(n,k). See also the entry in the graphs problem collection. View the LaTeX source
