# Problem: Erdős #346

## Statement

### Plain Language
Let $A=\{1\leq a_10$ and all $n$ then\[\lim_n \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}?\]



Graham \cite{Gr64d} has shown that the sequence $a_n=F_n-(-1)^{n}$, where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number, has these properties. Erd\H{o}s and Graham \cite{ErGr80} remark that it is easy to see that if $a_{n+1}/a_n>\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ then the second property is automatically satisfied, and that it is not hard to construct v...


### Formal Statement
$$
Let $A=\{1\leq a_1< a_2<\cdots\}$ be a set of integers such that
{UL}
{LI} $A\backslash B$ is complete for any finite subset $B$ and {/LI}
{LI} $A\backslash B$ is not complete for any infinite subset $B$.{/LI}
{/UL}
(Here 'complete' means all sufficiently large integers can be written as a sum of distinct members of the sequence.)

Is it true that if $a_{n+1}/a_n \geq 1+\epsilon$ for some $\epsilon>0$ and all $n$ then\[\lim_n \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}?\]



Graham \cite{Gr64d} has shown that the sequence $a_n=F_n-(-1)^{n}$, where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number, has these properties. Erd\H{o}s and Graham \cite{ErGr80} remark that it is easy to see that if $a_{n+1}/a_n>\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ then the second property is automatically satisfied, and that it is not hard to construct very irregular sequences satisfying both properties.
