# Problem: Erdős #218

## Statement

### Plain Language
Let $d_n=p_{n+1}-p_n$. The set of $n$ such that $d_{n+1}\geq d_n$ has density $1/2$, and similarly for $d_{n+1}\leq d_n$. Furthermore, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $d_{n+1}=d_n$.



In \cite{Er85c} Erd\H{o}s also conjectures that $d_n=d_{n+1}=\cdots=d_{n+k}$ is solvable for every $k$ (which is equivalent to $k$ consecutive primes in arithmetic progression, see [141]).
