# Erdős #28 - Knowledge Base

## Problem Statement

If $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is such that $A+A$ contains all but finitely many integers then $\limsup 1_A\ast 1_A(n)=\infty$. Conjectured by Erdős and Turán. They also suggest the stronger conjecture that $\limsup 1_A\ast 1_A(n)/\log n>0$. Another stronger conjecture would be that the hypothesis $\lvert A\cap [1,N]\rvert \gg N^{1/2}$ for all large $N$ suffices. Erdős and Sárközy conjectured the stronger version that if $A=\{a_1[40]. This is discussed in problem C9 of Guy's collection [Gu04]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 18 November 2025.
