Let $A(x)$ count the number of composite $u<x$ such that $n!+1\equiv 0\pmod{u}$ for some $n$. Is it true that $A(x)\leq x^{o(1)}$?



A question of Erd\H{o}s raised in discussions with Hardy and Subbarao \cite{HaSu02}. The sequence of such $u$ begins\[25,121,169,437,\ldots\]and is A256519 in the OEIS.

Wilson's theorem states that $u$ is prime if and only if $(u-1)!+1\equiv 0\pmod{u}$.

This is mentioned in problem A2 of ...
