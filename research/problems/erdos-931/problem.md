Let $k_1\geq k_2\geq 3$. Are there only finitely many $n_2\geq n_1+k_1$ such that\[\prod_{1\leq i\leq k_1}(n_1+i)\textrm{ and }\prod_{1\leq j\leq k_2}(n_2+j)\]have the same prime factors?



Tijdeman gave the example\[19,20,21,22\textrm{ and }54,55,56,57.\]Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er76d} was unsure of this conjecture, and thought perhaps if the two products have the same prime factors then $n_2>2(n_1+k_1)$. It is not clear but it ...

It is not clear but it is possible that he meant to ask this question also permitting finitely many counterexamples. Indeed, without this caveat it is false - AlphaProof has found the counterexample\[10! = 2^8\cdot 3^4\cdot 5^2\cdot 7\]and\[14\cdot 15\cdot 16 = 2^5\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7,\]so that $n_1=0$, $k_1=10$, $n_2=13$, and $k_2=3$.

This is discussed in problem B35 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}.
