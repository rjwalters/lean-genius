Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be such that $A+A$ has positive density. Can one always decompose $A=A_1\sqcup A_2$ such that $A_1+A_1$ and $A_2+A_2$ both have positive density?

Is there a basis $A$ of order $2$ such that if $A=A_1\sqcup A_2$ then $A_1+A_1$ and $A_2+A_2$ cannot both have bounded gaps?



A problem of Burr and Erd\H{o}s. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er94b} thought he could construct a basis as in the second question, but 'could never quite finish the proof'.
