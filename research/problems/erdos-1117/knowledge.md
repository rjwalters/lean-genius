Let $f(z)$ be an entire function which is not a monomial. Let $\nu(r)$ count the number of $z$ with $\lvert z\rvert=r$ such that $\lvert f(z)\rvert=\max_{\lvert z\rvert=r}\lvert f(z)\rvert$. (This is a finite quantity if $f$ is not a monomial.)

Is it possible for\[\limsup \nu(r)=\infty?\]Is it possible for\[\liminf \nu(r)=\infty?\]



This is Problem 2.16 in \cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s.

The answer to the first question is yes, as shown by Herzog and Piranian \cite{HePi68}. The second question is still open, although an 'approximate' affirmative answer is given by Gl\"{u}cksam and Pardo-Sim\'{o}n \cite{GlPa24}.
