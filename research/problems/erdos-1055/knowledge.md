A prime $p$ is in class $1$ if the only prime divisors of $p+1$ are $2$ or $3$. In general, a prime $p$ is in class $r$ if every prime factor of $p+1$ is in some class $\leq r-1$, with equality for at least one prime factor.

Are there infinitely many primes in each class? If $p_r$ is the least prime in class $r$, then how does $p_r^{1/r}$ behave?



A classification due to Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge. It is easy to prove that the number of primes $\leq n$ in class $r$ is at most $n^{o(1)}$.

The sequence $p_r$ begins $2,13,37,73,1021$ (A005113 in the OEIS). Erd\H{o}s thought $p_r^{1/r}\to \infty$, while Selfridge thought it quite likely to be bounded.

A similar question can be asked replacing $p+1$ with $p-1$.

This is problem A18 in Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}.
