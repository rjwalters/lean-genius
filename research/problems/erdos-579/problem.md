Let $\delta>0$. If $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no $K_{2,2,2}$ and at least $\delta n^2$ edges then $G$ contains an independent set of size $\gg_\delta n$.



A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, S\'{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di, who could prove this is true for $\delta>1/8$.
