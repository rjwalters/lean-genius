## S3 — GAP found in PR #24443's DirichletWitnessProperty (researcher-5, 2026-06-15)

Build-free AUDIT (Docker blackout). Open PR #24443 reduces the sufficiency axiom
to a uniform `DirichletWitnessProperty`; **that property is FALSE for n ≡ 3 (mod 8)**.

- Certified (`verify_dirichlet_witness.py`): `legendreSym(d·n−1, −d)` is a function
  of `(n%8, d%8)`; n≡3 mod 8 has NO +1 class ⇒ no witness for any of the 750
  witness-less n<6000 (all ≡3 mod 8, all genuinely sums of three squares).
- So #24443's `three_sq_of_dirichlet_witness` is conditionally valid but its
  hypothesis can't be discharged; the proposed next step is impossible as written.
- Correct n≡3 route (certified): ∃ odd t, (n−t²)/2 = a²+b² ⇒ n = t²+(a+b)²+(a−b)²
  (Mathlib two-squares, not dirichlet_key_lemma).
- **Fix**: split the witness property by residue (require n%8≠3; add the n≡3
  two-squares branch). See `WITNESS-GAP-S3.md`.

## Current State
**Phase**: OBSERVE
**Path**: full
**Since**: 2026-06-15 (S1 OBSERVE, researcher-3)
**Iteration**: 1

## Current Focus
Quantified the ℤ[√−2] reach behind the prior qualitative ORIENT verdict
(#24256/#24257) and pinned the elementary, formalizable forward obstruction.

## Active Approach
Numerical OBSERVE (no Docker): verify the target iff, measure the `x²+2y²`
subset, exhibit gap witnesses, and isolate the Lean-ready forward direction.

## Verified This Session (Python, reproducible)
- three-square ⟺ `¬4ᵃ(8b+7)` holds over 0..20000 (0 mismatches).
- `x²+2y²` (ℤ[√−2] norm) covers only **36.1%** of three-square numbers;
  smallest miss = **5**. Subset inclusion `x²+2y² ⟹ 3 squares` clean (0 viol).
- Forward obstruction decomposition: squares mod 8 ∈ {0,1,4} (omits 7) + 4-descent.

See `verify_three_square_observe.py` and `knowledge.md`.

## Attempt Count
- Total attempts: 1
- Current approach attempts: 1
- Approaches tried: 1 (numerical OBSERVE)

## Blockers
- Docker unavailable (`docker ps` hangs) → ACT (Lean forward obstruction) deferred.

## Next Action
ACT (when Docker returns): formalize the forward obstruction (squares mod 8 ⊆
{0,1,4} via `ZMod`/`decide` + 4-descent) as a standalone ℤ[√−2]-independent
lemma. The converse stays open (ternary forms / Dirichlet, >1000 LOC, not served
by the `x²+2y²` norm form).
