Let $r\geq 2$ and $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ be such that $A_i\not\subseteq A_j$ for all $i\neq j$ and for any $t$ if there exists some $i$ with $\lvert A_i\rvert=t$ then there must exist at least $r$ sets of that size.

How large must $n$ be (as a function of $r$) to ensure that there is such a family which achieves $n-3$ distinct sizes of sets?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Trotter. For $r=1$ and $n>3$ the...

A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Trotter. For $r=1$ and $n>3$ the maximum possible is $n-2$. For $r>1$ and $n$ sufficiently large $n-3$ is achievable, but $n-2$ is never achievable.
