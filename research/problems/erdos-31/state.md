# Current State

**Phase**: EXPLORATION
**Since**: 2026-01-14T00:00:00Z
**Iteration**: 2

## Current Focus

Helper lemmas proved. 7 axioms remain for deep results.

## Active Approach

Full formalization with axiomatized main theorem (Lorentz 1954).
Counting bounds and density lemmas now fully proved.

## Blockers

None - remaining axioms are "deep" mathematical results:
- Lorentz 1954 main theorem and bounds
- Prime density theorem
- Optimal density characterization

## Next Action

Consider submitting to Aristotle for prime density proof, or accept axioms as published results.
