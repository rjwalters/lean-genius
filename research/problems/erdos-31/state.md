# Current State

**Phase**: EXPLORATION
**Since**: 2026-01-14T00:00:00Z
**Iteration**: 1

## Current Focus

Formalization complete. Problem is SOLVED by Lorentz 1954.

## Active Approach

Full formalization with axiomatized main theorem and supporting lemmas.

## Blockers

None - problem is solved. Sorries are for helper lemmas (density proofs).

## Next Action

Consider submitting to Aristotle for proof of helper lemmas (density of powers, squares).
