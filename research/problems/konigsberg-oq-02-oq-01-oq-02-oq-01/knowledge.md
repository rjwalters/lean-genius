## Session 2026-07-04 (Session 1) — Statement + reduction analysis

**Mode**: FRESH
**Outcome**: progress (ORIENT→ACT: compiling statement, sufficiency sorry)

### What I Did
- Claimed the problem (undirected Hierholzer sufficiency).
- Created `proofs/Proofs/KonigsbergOQ02OQ01OQ02OQ01.lean` stating
  `undirected_euler_circuit_sufficient` (1 sorry) and the full characterization
  `undirected_euler_circuit_iff` (necessity half fully proved via
  `IsEulerian.even_degree_iff`).
- Verified it builds in Docker (only the expected `sorry` warning); needed
  `import Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Connectivity.Connected`.

### Key Findings
- Mathlib has Eulerian degree bookkeeping but no undirected existence/Hierholzer.
- The fully-proved DIRECTED analogue (`directed_euler_circuit_sufficient_corrected`
  in `KonigsbergOQ02OQ01.lean`, ~900 lines) is a structural template.
- **Naive doubling reduction FAILS**: splitting each undirected edge into two
  opposite arcs makes the digraph balanced/strongly-connected, but the resulting
  directed Eulerian circuit uses each undirected edge twice — not an undirected
  Eulerian circuit. A native undirected argument is required.

### Files Modified
- proofs/Proofs/KonigsbergOQ02OQ01OQ02OQ01.lean (new)
- src/data/research/problems/konigsberg-oq-02-oq-01-oq-02-oq-01.json (knowledge)

### Next Steps
- Port the 3-step Hierholzer sub-lemma structure (maximal trail is closed →
  edge removal preserves even degree → splice via shared vertex → induct on edges).
- Re-submit the sorry file to Aristotle from the main repo (MCP "Resource not
  found" from the worktree) as a KNOWN result.

## Session 2026-07-04 (Session 2) — Base case verified; plan corrected

**Mode**: REVISIT (depth line) | **Outcome**: progress (1 verified lemma)

### What I Did
- Confirmed via web search + local check that Mathlib4 still has NO undirected
  Eulerian existence/Hierholzer construction (only `even_degree_iff`,
  `card_odd_degree`).
- Confirmed the directed `Digraph` proof is NOT reusable: it is built on a bespoke
  `Digraph` type (own Walk/splice/removeArcList/arcCount), not `SimpleGraph.Walk`.
- Wrote and **verified** the induction base case in a new dev file:
  `euler_circuit_of_edgeSet_empty` (connected + `G.edgeSet = ∅` ⇒ Eulerian circuit
  via the `nil` walk). Compiles clean, 0 sorries.
- Aristotle backend was fully DOWN (`Resource not found` even for inline `1+1=2`),
  so the known-result delegation could not run this session.

### Key Findings
- **Definition correction**: Mathlib's `IsEulerian p := ∀ e ∈ G.edgeSet,
  p.edges.count e = 1` — a per-edge count condition, NOT `IsTrail ∧ covers-all`.
  Trail-ness is derived (`IsEulerian.isTrail`). The construction invariant is the
  count=1 condition. `IsEulerian` needs `[DecidableEq V]`.

### Files Modified
- proofs/Proofs/KonigsbergOQ02OQ01OQ02OQ01Dev.lean (new — base case, verified)
- src/data/research/problems/konigsberg-oq-02-oq-01-oq-02-oq-01.json (knowledge)

### Next Steps
- Sub-lemma A: maximal trail in an all-even graph is closed (parity/handshake).
- Sub-lemma B: `G.deleteEdges (closed trail edges)` preserves `∀ v, Even (degree v)`.
- Sub-lemma C: splice residual circuit via shared vertex; strong induction on
  `edgeFinset.card` using the verified base case.
- Resubmit the single sorry to Aristotle once the backend recovers.
