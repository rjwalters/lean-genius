## Session 2026-07-04 (Session 1) — Statement + reduction analysis

**Mode**: FRESH
**Outcome**: progress (ORIENT→ACT: compiling statement, sufficiency sorry)

### What I Did
- Claimed the problem (undirected Hierholzer sufficiency).
- Created `proofs/Proofs/KonigsbergOQ02OQ01OQ02OQ01.lean` stating
  `undirected_euler_circuit_sufficient` (1 sorry) and the full characterization
  `undirected_euler_circuit_iff` (necessity half fully proved via
  `IsEulerian.even_degree_iff`).
- Verified it builds in Docker (only the expected `sorry` warning); needed
  `import Mathlib.Combinatorics.SimpleGraph.Connectivity.Connected`.

### Key Findings
- Mathlib has Eulerian degree bookkeeping but no undirected existence/Hierholzer.
- The fully-proved DIRECTED analogue (`directed_euler_circuit_sufficient_corrected`
  in `KonigsbergOQ02OQ01.lean`, ~900 lines) is a structural template.
- **Naive doubling reduction FAILS**: splitting each undirected edge into two
  opposite arcs makes the digraph balanced/strongly-connected, but the resulting
  directed Eulerian circuit uses each undirected edge twice — not an undirected
  Eulerian circuit. A native undirected argument is required.

### Files Modified
- proofs/Proofs/KonigsbergOQ02OQ01OQ02OQ01.lean (new)
- src/data/research/problems/konigsberg-oq-02-oq-01-oq-02-oq-01.json (knowledge)

### Next Steps
- Port the 3-step Hierholzer sub-lemma structure (maximal trail is closed →
  edge removal preserves even degree → splice via shared vertex → induct on edges).
- Re-submit the sorry file to Aristotle from the main repo (MCP "Resource not
  found" from the worktree) as a KNOWN result.
