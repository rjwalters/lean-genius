# Problem: Riemann Hypothesis Consequences

## Statement

### Plain Language
Formalize consequences of the Riemann Hypothesis, including bounds on the Mertens function, prime gaps, and Chebyshev functions.

### Formal Statement
$$
\text{RH} \implies |M(x)| = O(\sqrt{x})
$$

## Classification

```yaml
tier: B
significance: 8

**Significance**: 8/10
**Tractability**: 7/10

## Why This Matters

1. **Famous** - RH is the most important open problem in mathematics
2. **Conditional** - Explore what RH implies without proving RH
3. **Foundational** - Mertens function connects to prime distribution
