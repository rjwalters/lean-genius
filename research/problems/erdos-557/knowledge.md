Let $R(G;k)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $k$-coloured then there is a monochromatic copy of $G$. Is it true that\[R(T;k)\leq kn+O(1)\]for any tree $T$ on $n$ vertices?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham. Implied by [548].

This would be best possible since, for example, $R(S_n,k)\geq kn-O(k)$ if $S_n=K_{1,n-1}$ is a star on $n$ vertices.

This problem is #26 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.
