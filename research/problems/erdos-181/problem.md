Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph (so that $Q_n$ has $2^n$ vertices and $n2^{n-1}$ edges). Prove that\[R(Q_n) \ll 2^n.\]



Conjectured by Burr and Erd\H{o}s, althouhg in \cite{Er93} Erd\H{o}s says the behaviour of $R(Q_n)$ was considered by himself and S\'{o}s, who could not decide whether $R(Q_n)/2^n\to \infty$ or not.

The trivial bound is\[R(Q_n) \leq R(K_{2^n})\leq C^{2^n}\]for some constant $C>1$. Thi...

Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph (so that $Q_n$ has $2^n$ vertices and $n2^{n-1}$ edges). Prove that\[R(Q_n) \ll 2^n.\]



Conjectured by Burr and Erd\H{o}s, althouhg in \cite{Er93} Erd\H{o}s says the behaviour of $R(Q_n)$ was considered by himself and S\'{o}s, who could not decide whether $R(Q_n)/2^n\to \infty$ or not.

The trivial bound is\[R(Q_n) \leq R(K_{2^n})\leq C^{2^n}\]for some constant $C>1$. This was improved a number of times; the current best bound due to Tikhomirov \cite{Ti22} is\[R(Q_n)\ll 2^{(2-c)n}\]for some small constant $c>0$. (In fact $c\approx 0.03656$ is permissible.)

This problem is #20 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection.
