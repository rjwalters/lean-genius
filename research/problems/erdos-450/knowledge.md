How large must $y=y(\epsilon,n)$ be such that the number of integers in $(x,x+y)$ with a divisor in $(n,2n)$ is at most $\epsilon y$?



It is not clear what the intended quantifier on $x$ is. Cambie has observed that if this is intended to hold for all $x$ then, provided\[\epsilon(\log n)^\delta (\log\log n)^{3/2}\to \infty\]as $n\to \infty$, where $\delta=0.086\cdots$, there is no such $y$, which follows from an averaging argument and the work of Ford \cite{Fo08}.

On the other hand, Cambie has observed that if $\epsilon\ll 1/n$ then $y(\epsilon,n)\sim 2n$: indeed, if $y<2n$ then this is impossible taking $x+n$ to be a multiple of the lowest common multiple of $\{n+1,\ldots,2n-1\}$. On the other hand, for every fixed $\delta\in (0,1)$ and $n$ large every $2(1+\delta)n$ consecutive elements contains many elements which are a multiple of an element in $(n,2n)$.
