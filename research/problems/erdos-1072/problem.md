For any prime $p$, let $f(p)$ be the least integer such that $f(p)!+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$.

Is it true that there are infinitely many $p$ for which $f(p)=p-1$?
Is it true that $f(p)/p\to 0$ for almost all $p$?



Questions formulated by Erd\H{o}s, Hardy, and Subbarao \cite{HaSu02}, who believed that the number of $p\leq x$ for which $f(p)=p-1$ is $o(x/\log x)$.

These are mentioned in problem A2 of Guy's collection.
