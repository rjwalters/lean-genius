# Problem: Erdős #278

## Statement

### Plain Language
Let $A=\{n_1<\cdots<n_r\}$ be a finite set of integers. What is the maximum density of integers covered by a suitable choice of congruences $a_i\pmod{n_i}$?

Is the minimum density achieved when all the $a_i$ are equal?



Simpson \cite{Si86} has observed that the density of integers covered is at least\[\sum_i \frac{1}{n_i}-\sum_{i<j}\frac{1}{[n_i,n_j]}+\sum_{i<j<k}\frac{1}{[n_i,n_j,n_k]}-\cdot\](where $[\cdots]$ denotes...
