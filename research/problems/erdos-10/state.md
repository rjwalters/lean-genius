# Current State

**Phase**: ACT
**Since**: 2026-01-15
**Iteration**: 3

## Current Focus

Fully proved k=2 counterexample (removed axiom), added de Polignac covering congruence method.

## Active Approach

Counterexample enumeration + covering congruence formalization.

## Proven Results
- k=1 insufficient: 262 (fully proved)
- k=2 insufficient: 906 (FULLY PROVED - no axiom!)
- k=3 insufficient: 1,117,175,146 (Grechuk, axiom)
- De Polignac numbers: infinitely many (theorem)

## Blockers

None currently.

## Next Action

Search for k=4 counterexamples computationally, or formalize Chen et al. 2024 results.
