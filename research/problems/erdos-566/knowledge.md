Let $G$ be such that any subgraph on $k$ vertices has at most $2k-3$ edges. Is it true that, if $H$ has $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, then\[R(G,H)\ll m?\]



In other words, is $G$ Ramsey size linear? This fails for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $2n-2$ edges (for example with $H=K_n$). Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp \cite{EFRS93} have shown that any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and at most $n+1$ edges is Ramsey size linear.


Implies [567].
