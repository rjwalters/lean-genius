Is there a polynomial $f:\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ of degree at least $2$ and a set $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ such that for any $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ there is exactly one $a\in A$ and $b\in \{ f(n) : n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ such that $n=a+b$?



A question of Erd\H{o}s and Graham, who thought the answer was negative.
