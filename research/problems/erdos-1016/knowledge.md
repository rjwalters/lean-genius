Let $h(n)$ be minimal such that there is a graph on $n$ vertices with $n+h(n)$ edges which contains a cycle on $k$ vertices, for all $3\leq k\leq n$. Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, is it true that\[h(n) \geq \log_2n+\log_*n-O(1),\]where $\log_*n$ is the iterated logarithmic function?



Such graphs are called pancyclic. A problem of Bondy \cite{Bo71}, who claimed a proof (without details) of\[\log_2(n-1)-1\leq h(n) \leq \log_2n+\log_*n+O(1).\]Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er71} believed the upper bound is closer to the truth, but could not even prove $h(n)-\log_2n\to \infty$.

A proof of the above lower bound is provided by Griffin \cite{Gr13}. The first published proof of the upper bound appears to be in Chapter 4.5 of George, Khodkar, and Wallis \cite{GKW16}.
