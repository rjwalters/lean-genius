Let $\delta>0$. If $n$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with no $K_5$ and at least $\delta n^2$ edges then $G$ contains a set of $\gg_\delta n$ vertices containing no triangle.




A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, Simonovits, S\'{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di, who could prove this is true for $\delta>1/16$, and could further prove it for $\delta>0$ if we replace $K_5$ with $K_4$.

They further observed that it fails for $\delta =1/4$ if we replace $K_5$ with $K_7$: by a construction of Erd\H{o}s and Rogers \cite{ErRo62} (see [620]) there exists some constant $c>0$ such that, for all large $n$, there is a graph on $n$ vertices which contains no $K_4$ and every set of at least $n^{1-c}$ vertices contains a triangle. If we take two vertex disjoint copies of this graph and add all edges between the two copies then this yields a graph on $2n$ vertices with $\geq n^2$ edges, which contains no $K_7$, yet every set of at least $2n^{1-c}$ vertices contains a triangle.
