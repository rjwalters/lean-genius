## Session 2026-01-01 (Session 17) - Scouting

**Mode**: REVISIT
**Problem**: pnp-barriers
**Prior Status**: surveyed

**What we scouted**:
1. Searched for P/poly, circuit complexity formalization in Mathlib4 (2025-2026)
2. Searched for counting complexity (#P, GapP) formalization in Mathlib4
3. Searched for derandomization (Nisan-Wigderson) formalization in Lean
4. Found [LeanMillenniumPrizeProblems](https://github.com/lean-dojo/LeanMillenniumPrizeProblems) project
5. Found ECCC TR25-119 paper on counting complexity dimensions (GapP, #P)

**Scouting results**:
- **No Mathlib infrastructure** for P/poly, counting complexity, or derandomization
- LeanMillenniumPrizeProblems focuses on P vs NP statement, not barrier proofs
- Our file already has Part 21 (Circuit Complexity) and Part 22 (Counting Complexity)!
- Previous sessions added ~668 lines covering P/poly, NC, AC⁰, L, NL, #P, GapP, Toda's theorem

**Verified file status**:
- PNPBarriers.lean: **4071 lines**, 0 sorries
- Part 21: Circuit Complexity (P/poly, NC, AC⁰, L, NL) - COMPLETE
- Part 22: Counting Complexity (#P, GapP, Toda's theorem) - COMPLETE

**Next steps (from scouting)**:
1. Add communication complexity basics
2. Add derandomization (Nisan-Wigderson PRG construction)
3. Add average-case complexity (Levin's theory)
4. Add fine-grained complexity (SETH, 3SUM conjecture)

**Outcome**:
- **Scouted** - Confirmed no new Mathlib infrastructure available
- File already has P/poly and counting complexity from previous sessions
- Next target: communication complexity or derandomization
