Let $h(n)$ be such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line and no four on a circle, determine at least $h(n)$ distinct distances. Does $h(n)/n\to \infty$?



Erd\H{o}s could not even prove $h(n)\geq n$. Pach has shown $h(n)<n^{\log_23}$. Erd\H{o}s, F\"{u}redi, and Pach \cite{EFPR93} have improved this to\[h(n) < n\exp(c\sqrt{\log n})\]for some constant $c>0$.
