# Problem: Erdős #761

## Statement

### Plain Language
The cochromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\zeta(G)$, is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the vertices of $G$ such that each colour class induces either a complete graph or empty graph. The dichromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\delta(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ of colours required such that, in any orientation of the edges of $G$, there is a $k$-colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that there are no mo...


### Formal Statement
$$
The cochromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\zeta(G)$, is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the vertices of $G$ such that each colour class induces either a complete graph or empty graph. The dichromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\delta(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ of colours required such that, in any orientation of the edges of $G$, there is a $k$-colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that there are no monochromatic oriented cycles.

Must a graph with large chromatic number have large dichromatic number? Must a graph with large cochromatic number contain a graph with large dichromatic number?



The first question is due to Erd\H{o}s and Neumann-Lara. The second question is due to Erd\H{o}s and Gimbel. A positive answer to the second question implies a positive answer to the first via the bound mentioned in [760].
