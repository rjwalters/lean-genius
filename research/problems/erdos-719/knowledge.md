Let $\mathrm{ex}_r(n;K_{r+1}^r)$ be the maximum number of $r$-edges that can be placed on $n$ vertices without forming a $K_{r+1}^r$ (the $r$-uniform complete graph on $r+1$ vertices).

Is every $r$-hypergraph $G$ on $n$ vertices the union of at most $\mathrm{ex}_{r}(n;K_{r+1}^r)$ many copies of $K_r^r$ and $K_{r+1}^r$, no two of which share a $K_r^r$?



A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Sauer.
