Are there, for all large $n$, some points $x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the number of distinct distances $d(x_i,y_j)$ is\[o\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{\log n}}\right)?\]



One can also ask this for points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In $\mathbb{R}^4$ Lenz observed that there are $x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n\in \mathbb{R}^4$ such that $d(x_i,y_j)=1$ for all $i,j$, taking the points on two orthogonal circles.

More generally, if $F(2n)$ is the minimal number of such distances, and $f(2n)$ is minimal number of distinct distances between any $2n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, then is $F =o(f)$?
