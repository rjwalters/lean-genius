# Current State

**Phase**: EXPLORATION
**Since**: 2026-01-14T00:00:00Z
**Iteration**: 1

## Current Focus

Formalization complete. Problem is SOLVED by Kelley-Meka 2023.

## Active Approach

Full formalization with axiomatized main theorem and historical progression of bounds.

## Blockers

None - problem is solved. Sorries are for corollaries and helper lemmas.

## Next Action

Could submit examples (singleton, 8-element set) to Aristotle for proof search.
