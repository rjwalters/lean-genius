Let $2=p_1<p_2<\cdots$ be the primes and $k\geq 2$. Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $n$, there must exist an integer in $[n,n+p_1\cdots p_k)$ with $>k$ many prime factors?



Schinzel deduced from P\'{o}lya's theorem \cite{Po18} (that the sequence of $k$-smooth integers has unbounded gaps) that this is true with $p_1\cdots p_k$ replaced by $p_1\cdots p_{k-1}p_{k+1}$.

This is unknown even for $k=2$ - that is, is it true that in every interval of $6$ (sufficiently large) consecutive integers there must exist one with at least $3$ prime factors?

Weisenberg has observed that Dickson's conjecture implies the answer is no if we replace $p_1\cdots p_k$ with $p_1\cdots p_k-1$. Indeed, let $L_k$ be the lowest common multiple of all integers at most $p_1\cdots p_k$. By Dickson's conjecture there are infinitely many $n'$ such that $\frac{L_k}{m}n'+1$ is prime for all $1\leq m<p_1\cdots p_k$. It follows that, if $n=L_kn'+1$, then all integers in $[n,n+p_1\cdots p_k-1)$ have at most $k$ prime factors.
