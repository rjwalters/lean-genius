# Problem: Erdős #332

## Statement

### Plain Language
Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $D(A)$ be the set of those numbers which occur infinitely often as $a_1-a_2$ with $a_1,a_2\in A$. What conditions on $A$ are sufficient to ensure $D(A)$ has bounded gaps?



Prikry, Tijdeman, Stewart, and others (see the survey articles \cite{St78} and \cite{Ti79}) have shown that a sufficient condition is that $A$ has positive density.

One can also ask what conditions are sufficient for $...

One can also ask what conditions are sufficient for $D(A)$ to have positive density, or for $\sum_{d\in D(A)}\frac{1}{d}=\infty$, or even just $D(A)\neq\emptyset$.
