Let $f(m)$ be some function such that $f(m)\to \infty$ as $m\to \infty$. Does there exist a graph $G$ of infinite chromatic number such that every subgraph on $m$ vertices contains an independent set of size at least $\frac{m}{2}-f(m)$?



In \cite{Er69b} Erd\H{o}s conjectures this for $f(m)=\epsilon m$ for any fixed $\epsilon>0$. This follows from a result of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{EHS82}, as described by msellke in the comments.

In \cite{ErHa67b} Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal prove this for $f(m)\geq cm$ for all $c>1/4$.

See also [75].
