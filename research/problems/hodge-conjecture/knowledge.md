# Knowledge Base: hodge-conjecture

## Problem Understanding

### Core Statement
On a smooth projective complex variety, every Hodge class is a rational linear combination of classes of algebraic cycles.

### Formalization Requirements
1. Complex algebraic varieties
2. De Rham cohomology
3. Hodge decomposition
4. Algebraic cycles
5. Cycle class map

## Blockers

### Primary Blocker: Hodge Theory
**Status**: BLOCKED
**Severity**: Critical

Mathlib lacks:
- [ ] Hodge decomposition
- [ ] Dolbeault cohomology
- [ ] Complex differential geometry
- [ ] Algebraic cycles

### Secondary Blocker: Algebraic Geometry Depth
Even with basics, we need:
- [ ] Smooth projective varieties
- [ ] Sheaf cohomology (advanced)
- [ ] Intersection theory

## Tractable Partial Work

1. **State the conjecture** - Define terms axiomatically
2. **K3 surfaces case** - Known for certain K3s
3. **Abelian varieties** - Partial results
