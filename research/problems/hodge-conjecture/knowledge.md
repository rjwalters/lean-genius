# Knowledge Base: hodge-conjecture

## Problem Understanding

### Core Statement
On a smooth projective complex variety, every Hodge class is a rational linear combination of classes of algebraic cycles.

### Formalization Requirements
1. Complex algebraic varieties
2. De Rham cohomology
3. Hodge decomposition
4. Algebraic cycles
5. Cycle class map

## What We've Built
