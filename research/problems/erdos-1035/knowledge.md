Is there a constant $c>0$ such that every graph on $2^n$ vertices with minimum degree $>(1-c)2^n$ contains the $n$-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$?



Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er93} says 'if the conjecture is false, two related problems could be asked':
{UL}
{LI}Determine or estimate the smallest $m>2^n$ such that every graph on $m$ vertices with minimum degree $>(1-c)2^n$ contains a $Q_n$, and {/LI}
{LI}For which $u_n$ is it true that every graph on $2^n$ vertices with minimum degree $>2^n-u_n$ contains a $Q_n$.{/LI}
{/UL}

See also [576] for the extremal number of edges that guarantee a $Q_n$.
