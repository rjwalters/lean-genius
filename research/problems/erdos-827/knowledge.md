Let $n_k$ be minimal such that if $n_k$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are in general position then there exists a subset of $k$ points such that all $\binom{k}{3}$ triples determine circles of different radii.

Determine $n_k$.



In \cite{Er75h} Erd\H{o}s asks whether $n_k$ exists. In \cite{Er78c} he gave a simple argument which proves that it does, and in fact\[n_k \leq k+2\binom{k-1}{2}\binom{k-1}{3},\]but this argument is incorrect, as explained by Martinez and Rold\'{a}n-Pensado \cite{MaRo15}.

Martinez and Rold\'{a}n-Pensado give a corrected argument that proves $n_k\ll k^9$.
