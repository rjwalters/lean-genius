# Problem: Erdős #681

## Statement

### Plain Language
Is it true that for all large $n$ there exists $k$ such that $n+k$ is composite and\[p(n+k)>k^2,\]where $p(m)$ is the least prime factor of $m$?



Related to questions of Erd\H{o}s, Eggleton, and Selfridge. This may be true with $k^2$ replaced by $k^d$ for any $d$.

See also [680] and [682].
