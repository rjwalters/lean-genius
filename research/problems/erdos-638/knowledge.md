## Problem Statement

Let S" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">SSS be a family of finite graphs such that for every n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">nnn there is some Gn&#x2208;S" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">Gn∈SGn∈SG_n\in S such that if the edges of Gn" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GnGnG_n are coloured with n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">nnn colours then there is a monochromatic triangle. Is it true that for every infinite cardinal &#x2135;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">ℵℵ\aleph there is a graph G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG of which every finite subgraph is in S" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">SSS and if the edges of G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG are coloured with &#x2135;" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">ℵℵ\aleph many colours then there is a monochromatic triangle.
