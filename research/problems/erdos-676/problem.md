# Problem: Erdős #676

## Statement

### Plain Language
Is every sufficiently large integer of the form\[ap^2+b\]for some prime $p$ and integer $a\geq 1$ and $0\leq b0$. Erdős [Er79] believed it is 'rather unlikely' that all large integers are of this form. What if the condition that $p$ is prime is omitted? Selfridge and Wagstaff made a 'preliminary computer search' and suggested that there are infinitely many $n$ not of this form even without the condition that $p$ is prime. It should be true that the number of exceptions in $[1,x]$ is $ View th...
