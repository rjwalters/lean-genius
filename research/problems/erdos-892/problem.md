# Problem: Erdős #892

## Statement

### Plain Language
Is there a necessary and sufficient condition for a sequence of integers $b_1<b_2<\cdots$ that ensures there exists a primitive sequence $a_1<a_2<\cdots$ (i.e. no element divides another) with $a_n \ll b_n$ for all $n$?

In particular, is this always possible if there are no non-trivial solutions to $(b_i,b_j)=b_k$?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ESS68}. It is known that\[\sum \frac{1}...

A problem of Erd\H{o}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ESS68}. It is known that\[\sum \frac{1}{b_n\log b_n}<\infty\]and\[\sum_{b_n<x}\frac{1}{b_n} =o\left(\frac{\log x}{\sqrt{\log\log x}}\right)\]are both necessary. (The former is due to Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er35}, the latter to Erd\H{o}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ESS67}.)

One can ask a similar question for sequences of real numbers, as in [143].
