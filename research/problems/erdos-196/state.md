# Current State

**Phase**: EXPLORATION
**Since**: 2026-01-14T00:00:00Z
**Iteration**: 1

## Current Focus

Formalization complete. Problem is OPEN - k=4 threshold between proved k=3 and disproved k=5.

## Active Approach

Full formalization with axiomatized known results (DEGS 1977).

## Blockers

Problem is OPEN - no proof strategy available.

## Next Action

Consider explicit DEGS counterexample construction for k=5.
