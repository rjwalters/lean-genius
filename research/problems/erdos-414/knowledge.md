Let $h_1(n)=h(n)=n+\tau(n)$ (where $\tau(n)$ counts the number of divisors of $n$) and $h_k(n)=h(h_{k-1}(n))$. Is it true, for any $m,n$, there exist $i$ and $j$ such that $h_i(m)=h_j(n)$?



Asked by Spiro. That is, there is (eventually) only one possible sequence that the iterations of $n\mapsto h(n)$ can settle on. Erd\H{o}s and Graham believed the answer is yes. Similar questions can be asked by the iterates of many other functions. See also [412] and [413].
