Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p-k!$ is composite for each $k$ such that $1\leq k!<p$?



A question of Erd\H{o}s reported in problem A2 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}.

Examples are $p=101$ and $p=211$. Erd\H{o}s suggested it may be easier to show that there are infinitely many $n$ such that, if $l!<n\leq (l+1)!$, then all the prime factors of $n$ are $>l$, and all the numbers $n-k!$ are composite for $1\leq k\leq l$.
