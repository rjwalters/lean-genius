Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, no five of which are on a line, the number of lines containing four points is $o(n^2)$.



There are examples of sets of $n$ points with $\sim n^2/6$ many collinear triples and no four points on a line. Such constructions are given by Burr, Gr\"{u}nbaum, and Sloane \cite{BGS74} and F\"{u}redi and Pal\'{a}sti \cite{FuPa84}.

Gr\"{u}nbaum \cite{Gr76} constructed an example with $\gg n^{3/2}$ such lines. Erd\H{o}s speculated this may be the correct order of magnitude. This is false: Solymosi and Stojakovi\'{c} \cite{SoSt13} have constructed a set with no five on a line and at least\[n^{2-O(1/\sqrt{\log n})}\]many lines containing exactly four points.

See also [102] and [669]. A generalisation of this problem is asked in [588].

This problem is Problem 71 on Green's open problems list.
