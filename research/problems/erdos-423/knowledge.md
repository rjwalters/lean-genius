Let $a_1=1$ and $a_2=2$ and for $k\geq 3$ we choose $a_k$ to be the least integer $>a_{k-1}$ which is the sum of at least two consecutive terms of the sequence. What is the asymptotic behaviour of this sequence?



Asked by Hofstadter (although in \cite{Er77c} Erd\H{o}s says this question was originally due to Ulam). The sequence begins $1,2,3,5,6,8,10,11,\ldots$ and is A005243 in the OEIS.
