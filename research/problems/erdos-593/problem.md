# Problem: Erdős #593

## Statement

### Plain Language
Characterize those finite 3-uniform hypergraphs which appear in every 3-uniform hypergraph of chromatic number $>\aleph_0$.



Similar problems were investigated by Erd\H{o}s, Galvin, and Hajnal \cite{EGH75}. Erd\H{o}s claims that for graphs the problem is completely solved: a graph of chromatic number $\geq \aleph_1$ must contain all finite bipartite graphs but need not contain any fixed odd cycle.
