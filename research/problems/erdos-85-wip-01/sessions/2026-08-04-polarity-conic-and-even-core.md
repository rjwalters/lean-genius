# Erdős 85 polarity conic and even-core checkpoint — 2026-08-04

## Status

Eventual monotonicity remains open.  This session substantially extended the
finite-field polarity families and identified an exact obstruction to the
most natural one-vertex extension of a new regular witness.

All results below compile with pinned Lean 4.31 and have the standard axiom
inventory `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

## Odd characteristic

The absolute locus was parametrized explicitly.  Starting from an absolute
vector `a` and a transverse vector `b`, put `w = a × b` and

```text
x(t) = b + t w
       - (b·b + t²(w·w)) / (2(a·b)) a.
```

The map `Option K → absolutePoints K` sending `none` to `[a]` and `some t`
to `[x(t)]` is bijective.  Consequently the absolute conic has exactly
`q + 1` points.  The odd two-secant theorem then gives, for every
`k ≤ q + 1`,

```text
q ≤ f(q² + q + 1 - k) ≤ q + 1.
```

The main implementation is `Erdos85PolarityConic.lean`.

## Characteristic two

For `n = [1,1,1]`, the identity

```text
x·x = 0  ↔  n·x = 0
```

shows that the absolute locus is the polar line of the nonabsolute nucleus
`[n]`.  This proves the same exact cardinality `q + 1` in characteristic two,
and hence over every finite field.

Deleting the absolute line and its nucleus leaves a `C₄`-free graph on
`q² - 1` vertices.  Every survivor loses exactly one neighbor, so this core is
exactly `q`-regular.  The counting upper bound matches the witness:

```text
f(q² - 1) = q + 1.
```

It follows that the immediately preceding step is monotone:

```text
f(q² - 2) ≤ f(q² - 1).
```

## Exact attachment obstruction

For the characteristic-two regular core, every
common-neighbor-independent attachment set has cardinality at most `q - 1`.
The bound is sharp: the surviving points on the polar line of any absolute
point form such a set.  Equivalently,

```text
indepNum (commonNeighborConflict evenCore) = q - 1.
```

Thus the standard one-new-vertex attachment cannot extend this `q`-regular
core while preserving minimum degree `q`; it is exactly one selector vertex
short.  This is an obstruction for this witness and this extension mechanism,
not a counterexample to monotonicity at `q² - 1 → q²`.

The characteristic-two development is in `Erdos85PolarityEven.lean`.

## Next directions

1. Investigate compensated or multi-vertex extensions of the even core that
   bypass its exact selector obstruction.
2. Determine whether the odd deletion band can be sharpened from the
   two-valued interval `{q,q+1}` at additional orders.
3. Use the exact conflict graph geometry of the even core to classify near-safe
   sets and possible edge-switching repairs.
