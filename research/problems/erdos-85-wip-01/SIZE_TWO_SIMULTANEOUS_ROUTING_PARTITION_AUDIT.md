# Size-two simultaneous routing partition audit

Status: q-generic synthesis of already proved routing and self-indexing
theorems, 2026-08-22.  The routing-color partition itself is already
formalized; this note isolates its endpoint-color identification with the
self-indexed diagonal blocks, which is absent from a single ODC or a single
target factorization.

## 1. Setup

Assume the binary square-order regular branch, and assume every second-order
defect component has normalized weight two.  Hence every component has order
`2q`, there are `r = q/2` components, and every cross-incidence block

```text
R_cd = Adj(G)[c,d]
```

is a `2q x 2q` zero-one matrix with every row and column sum equal to two.
The symmetry of the ambient graph gives

```text
R_dc = R_cd^T.                                           (1)
```

For a component `c`, write `A_c = Adj(G[c])`.  The self-indexing theorem is
the exact diagonal identity

```text
R_cc = A_c.                                              (2)
```

The relevant formal inputs are:

* `defectComponentCrossIncidenceMatrix_transpose`;
* `binarySquare_regular_twoSizeTwoParts_crossIndexedBlock_package`;
* `defectComponentSelfIncidenceMatrix_eq_induced_adjMatrix` and
  `binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoPart_selfIndexedBlock_package`;
* `transpose_cross_mul_cross_apply_eq_ite_intermediate`;
* `binarySquare_regular_threeSizeTwoParts_routing_row_card_eq_four`;
* `binarySquare_regular_threeSizeTwoParts_routing_column_card_eq_four`.

The graph-facing factor package and its entrywise resolution are already
formalized in `Erdos85OrderSixtyFourRoutingColorFactors` and
`Erdos85OrderSixtyFourRoutingColorRectangularOrthogonality`.  Sections 2 and
the first half of Section 4 below are therefore a matrix translation of
banked facts, not a new theorem claim.  The new synthesis begins with the
self-indexed endpoint identification (6).

## 2. Exact intermediate-component partition

Fix distinct endpoint components `c,e`.  For every component `d`, define

```text
Q_d^(c,e) = R_dc^T R_de = R_cd R_de.                    (3)
```

For `x in c` and `z in e`, C4-freeness and the square-order codegree law give
a unique common neighbor of `x,z`.  Its defect component is exactly
`crossIntermediateComponent G hfree hce x z`.  The proved matrix-entry
theorem therefore says

```text
Q_d^(c,e)(x,z) = 1  iff  d is that intermediate component,
Q_d^(c,e)(x,z) = 0  otherwise.                          (4)
```

Consequently the `r=q/2` matrices in (3) have pairwise disjoint support and

```text
sum_d Q_d^(c,e) = J_(2q,2q).                            (5)
```

The routing row/column theorems show that every `Q_d^(c,e)` has all row and
column sums equal to four.  Thus (5) is an exact decomposition of the complete
bipartite relation between `c` and `e` into `q/2` canonically colored
4-regular bipartite relations.  This is stronger than the scalar statement
that there are `q/2` colors: it pins every entry to its unique intermediate
component.

## 3. The self-indexed endpoint layers

Equations (1)-(2) identify the two endpoint colors in (5):

```text
Q_c^(c,e) = A_c R_ce,
Q_e^(c,e) = R_ce A_e.                                   (6)
```

Therefore both products in (6) are zero-one, 4-regular, and support-disjoint:

```text
(A_c R_ce) hadamard (R_ce A_e) = 0.                     (7)
```

For every third component `d`, the remaining layer is

```text
Q_d^(c,e) = R_cd R_de.                                  (8)
```

Equations (5)-(8) are the simultaneous self-indexed routing partition:

```text
A_c R_ce + R_ce A_e
  + sum_(d != c,e) R_cd R_de = J,                       (SRP)
```

and every summand is a disjoint-support 4-regular zero-one matrix.

The endpoint identification is the precise coherence condition missed by choosing pairwise ODCs or
paired cross-factor intertwiners independently.  The same cross block `R_ce`
must simultaneously avoid the two endpoint cycle-route supports in (7), and
all residual entries must split into the products through the other component
blocks as in (8).

As a calibration only, at `q=8`, (SRP) has exactly four layers: the two forced
endpoint layers and exactly two exterior layers.  Each row has the rigid partition

```text
4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.
```

Thus the parked order-64 all-size-two terminal admits a four-color
factorization of `K_(16,16)`, with two colors fixed by the internal cycle
systems and the cross 2-factor.  This observation is diagnostic only: the
order-64 lane is operator-gated, and this note neither proposes nor authorizes
a `q=8` census, SAT run, or endpoint attack.

## 4. What this does and does not prove

The uncolored sum in (SRP) is the `(c,e)` block of the ambient square identity,
so summing entries, taking ordinary row sums, or reducing the whole equation
modulo two gives no new contradiction.  The information is entirely in:

1. zero-one support of every individual product;
2. pairwise disjointness of those supports;
3. the forced endpoint forms `A_c R_ce` and `R_ce A_e`;
4. reuse of each `R_cd` in the routing partitions for every other endpoint.

In particular, (7) alone is only the no-four-cycle condition inside the
two-component induced graph.  A closing invariant must compare (SRP) for at
least two different endpoint pairs, so that one exterior product in one
partition becomes an endpoint-constrained factor in another.

The next nonduplicative theorem target is therefore the formal matrix package
for (SRP), followed by a **q-generic** classification (or uniform
countermodel) of simultaneous size-two coordinates satisfying all coupled
routing partitions.  A single-pair spectral, row-sum, or phase argument cannot
consume the new data.  No order-64-only classification belongs to this lane
without a new operator direction.

## 5. Cubic contraction audit

There is one tempting way to compare three endpoint partitions which is
already completely banked.  For pairwise distinct endpoint components
`c,e,f` and a routing color `d`, form

```text
T_d(x,z,w) = Q_d^(c,e)(x,z)
             Q_d^(e,f)(z,w)
             Q_d^(c,f)(x,w).                            (9)
```

Its support consists of endpoint triples whose three pairwise routes all have
intermediate component `d`.  The three canonical common neighbors either
coincide (the star completion) or are pairwise distinct and form an
owner-colored rainbow triangle inside `d`.  This is exactly the content of:

* `monochromatic_routing_completion_star_or_rainbow`;
* `binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoRoutingColor_two_lifts_or_owner_rainbow`;
* `binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoRoutingColor_rainbow_or_all_two_lifts`;
* `routingRainbowEndpointTriples_card_eq_ownerRainbowTriples_card`.

Thus an undifferentiated cubic sum of (9) cannot be advertised as a new
three-coordinate invariant.  In the no-rainbow branch the existing theorem
already gives the exact two canonical lifts; in the rainbow branch the exact
bijection transports the residual count to owner-factor triangles.

The genuinely unconsumed refinement is to intersect (9) with the endpoint
identities (6), especially when `d` equals one of `c,e,f`.  Then one factor is
forced to be `A_c R`, `R A_e`, or its cyclic analogue, so the star/rainbow
completion is constrained by a distinguished internal cycle step.  A next
argument must exploit that marked cycle step (or give a uniform model for it);
merely recounting monochromatic routing triples duplicates the existing
routing-rainbow package.

## 6. Endpoint-marked rooted normal form

Fix pairwise distinct endpoint components `c,e,f`, a root `x in c`, and take
the routing color to be the endpoint `c`.  Let the two internal neighbors of
`x` in the 2-regular graph `G[c]` be `u_0,u_1`.  The generic theorem
`routingRow_eq_biUnion_componentCrossNeighborFinset`, together with
`routingRow_starRows_pairwise_disjoint`, specializes to

```text
{z in e : route(x,z)=c} = Z_0 disjoint-union Z_1,
Z_i = N_G(u_i) cap e,             |Z_i|=2,              (10)

{w in f : route(x,w)=c} = W_0 disjoint-union W_1,
W_i = N_G(u_i) cap f,             |W_i|=2.              (11)
```

Thus the endpoint-colored four-point routing row is not merely an arbitrary
four-set: it is canonically paired by the two internal cycle directions at
`x`.

Now count pairs `(z,w)` for which all three routes `(x,z),(z,w),(x,w)` have
color `c`.

* If `z in Z_i` and `w in W_i`, then `u_i` is their common center.  These are
  the forced star completions.  There are exactly

  ```text
  2 * |Z_i| * |W_i| = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.                  (12)
  ```

* If `z in Z_i` and `w in W_j` with `i != j`, a color-`c` route from `z` to
  `w` has a center `y in c` distinct from `u_i,u_j`.  The edges
  `u_i-y` and `y-u_j` in the owner factorization are owned by `e` and `f`,
  respectively.  Conversely such a colored two-step middle `y` has unique
  subdivision vertices `(z,w)` by C4-freeness.  Hence the excess over (12)
  is exactly

  ```text
  E_x(e,f) = |N_(O_e[c])(u_0) cap N_(O_f[c])(u_1)|
           + |N_(O_e[c])(u_1) cap N_(O_f[c])(u_0)|.    (13)
  ```

Every restricted owner factor on a size-two source component is 2-regular,
so each intersection in (13) has size at most two.  The rooted endpoint-color
count therefore has the exact form

```text
8 + E_x(e,f),                 0 <= E_x(e,f) <= 4.       (14)
```

Summing the forced term over the `2q` roots of `c` gives `16q`; the residual
sum `sum_x E_x(e,f)` is precisely the owner-rainbow contribution whose
unmarked version is handled by the bijection in Section 5.

This exposes the remaining local question without overclaiming: the present
bank gives neither parity nor a positive lower bound for `E_x(e,f)`.  Such a
claim would require a new interaction between the two restricted owner
2-factors across the distinguished self edge `{u_0,u_1}`.  Their separate
commutation with `D[c]` does not imply that they commute with each other.
Consequently (14) is a normal form, not yet a contradiction; the next useful
input must constrain these oriented intersections simultaneously as `x`,
`e`, and `f` vary.

## 7. Marked-triangle / defect-codegree bridge

Let `F_a` denote the owner-`a` factor restricted to `c`.  The owner
factorization edge-partitions the q-regular selector complement

```text
H_c = complement(D[c]) = disjoint-union_a F_a,           (15)
```

and `F_c` is the distinguished self-source distance-two 2-factor.

Here "distance-two" means the proved distinct-common-neighbor graph, not
graph-metric distance exactly two.  Consequently an internal `C_3` maps to
another `C_3` (each pair shares the third vertex).  An internal `C_4` would
degenerate to a matching because opposite roots repeat the same pair, but it
is excluded by ambient C4-freeness.  Thus `F_c` is indeed 2-regular in the
present branch, including triangle components.

The two summands in (13) are exchanged by swapping `e` and `f`, so

```text
E_x(e,f) = E_x(f,e).                                    (16)
```

More intrinsically, let `s_x={u_0,u_1}` be the `F_c` edge indexed by the root
`x`.  For an unordered pair of distinct exterior colors `{e,f}`, `E_x(e,f)`
is exactly the number of triangles of `H_c` containing `s_x` whose other two
edges have colors `e` and `f`.  Hence summing `E_x(e,f)` over exterior color
pairs counts the exterior-rainbow part of the triangles through the marked
self edge.

The full number of triangles of `H_c` through `s_x` is

```text
codeg_(H_c)(u_0,u_1).                                   (17)
```

It also has an exact defect interpretation.  On `2q` vertices, `D[c]` is
`(q-1)`-regular and `H_c = J-I-D[c]`.  Expanding the square gives

```text
H_c^2 = I + D[c]^2 + 2D[c].                             (18)
```

Since `s_x` is an `H_c` edge, it is not a `D[c]` edge, and its endpoints are
distinct.  Evaluating (18) at `(u_0,u_1)` therefore yields

```text
codeg_(H_c)(u_0,u_1) = codeg_(D[c])(u_0,u_1).           (19)
```

Thus endpoint-marked routing supplies a colored refinement of a defect
codegree across every self-source edge.  Explicitly, the right side of (19)
splits on the left into:

1. the exterior-rainbow terms `E_x(e,f)`;
2. exterior-monochromatic triangles (both remaining edges in one `F_e`);
3. triangles using another self-color edge and one exterior edge;
4. triangles lying wholly in the self factor `F_c`.

Equation (19) is exact but does not by itself fix any one class.  In
particular, symmetry (16) gives no parity: it merely says the rainbow count is
indexed by unordered exterior color pairs.  A closing q-generic invariant
must control the other three classes, or compare the colored decomposition of
(19) at consecutive roots of the internal cycle.  Ordinary triangle totals
erase precisely this marked-edge information, as already observed in the
owner triangle inventory.

## 8. Joint-moment form of the marked mass

Write `A_c` for the adjacency matrix of the internal 2-factor `G[c]`, `S_c`
for the adjacency matrix of the self-source factor `F_c`, and `D_c` for
`D[c]`.  C4-freeness makes every off-diagonal common-neighbor count in
`G[c]` Boolean, while every diagonal entry of `A_c^2` is two.  The
distinct-common-neighbor theorem therefore gives the integer matrix identity

```text
S_c = A_c^2 - 2I.                                      (20)
```

This also covers an internal triangle: for `C_3`, `A_c^2-2I=A_c`.

Let `M_c` count pairs consisting of an `H_c`-triangle and a distinguished
self edge of that triangle.  (A triangle with two self edges is counted
twice.)  Summing (17) over the edges of `F_c` gives

```text
2 M_c = trace(S_c H_c^2) = trace(S_c D_c^2),            (21)
```

where the second equality is the summed form of (19).  The factor two comes
from the two orientations of every marked edge in the matrix trace.

The global commutation `AD=DA` restricts to `A_c D_c=D_c A_c`, because `D`
is block diagonal on its connected components.  Substituting (20) into (21)
and using this commutation yields

```text
2 M_c
  = trace((A_c^2-2I)D_c^2)
  = trace((A_c D_c)^2) - 2 trace(D_c^2)
  = trace((A_c D_c)^2) - 4q(q-1).                      (22)
```

Thus the endpoint-marked routing mass is a genuine joint fourth moment of the
internal cycle block and the defect block.  It is not determined by the
ordinary spectra of `A_c` and `D_c` separately: their common eigenbasis (or,
equivalently, the placement of `D_c` inside the commutant of the cycle
system) is required.

Equation (22) gives the necessary inequality

```text
trace((A_c D_c)^2) >= 4q(q-1),                          (23)
```

but this is just `M_c >= 0`; it is not a terminal by itself.  Its value is
that it identifies the exact spectral consumer of the colored refinement in
Section 7.  Any useful parity or lower bound for the exterior-rainbow portion
must refine (22) by owner colors, rather than recomputing the already fixed
uncolored trace.

## 9. Collision-table and parity localization

The joint moment has a more concrete entrywise form.  Put

```text
B_c = A_c D_c = D_c A_c.                                (24)
```

For vertices `x,k in c`, the entry `B_c(x,k)` counts the internal neighbors
of `x` that are defect-adjacent to `k`.  Since `x` has exactly two internal
neighbors,

```text
B_c(x,k) in {0,1,2}.                                    (25)
```

The self edge indexed by `x` is precisely the pair of those two internal
neighbors.  Thus `k` is a defect common neighbor of that self edge exactly
when both are defect-adjacent to `k`, equivalently when `B_c(x,k)=2`.
Using (19), this gives the exact collision-table identity

```text
M_c = #{(x,k) in c x c : B_c(x,k)=2}.                   (26)
```

It also recovers (22) without spectral language.  Every row of `B_c` has sum
`2(q-1)`, so

```text
sum_(x,k) B_c(x,k) = 4q(q-1).
```

For entries in `{0,1,2}`, `b^2=b+2*choose(b,2)`, and `choose(b,2)` is the
indicator of `b=2`.  Hence

```text
trace(B_c^2) = sum_(x,k) B_c(x,k)^2
             = 4q(q-1) + 2M_c,                         (27)
```

because `B_c` is symmetric.

Symmetry also localizes the parity question.  Off-diagonal entries equal to
two occur in transposed pairs, so

```text
M_c mod 2 = #{x in c : B_c(x,x)=2} mod 2.               (28)
```

Finally, `B_c(x,x)` is the number of the two internal `G[c]` edges incident
to `x` that are also edges of `D_c`.  Therefore

```text
B_c(x,x)=2
  iff both internal cycle edges at x are triangle-free edges of G.  (29)
```

Here “triangle-free edge” is literal: for an ambient edge `xy`, membership in
the second-order defect graph says that `x,y` have no common ambient neighbor.

Equations (28)-(29) show exactly why the raw joint trace did not decide
parity.  Evenness of `M_c` is equivalent to evenness of the number of internal
cycle vertices whose two incident internal edges are both triangle-free.

For even `q`, the bank is stronger than the handshake lemma:

* `binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoPart_triangleFree_degree_eq_zero_or_two`
  says every vertex of `c` has triangle-free degree zero or two;
* `binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoPart_triangleFree_degree_eq_of_reachable`
  says this status is constant along every connected component of `G[c]`.

Therefore the diagonal-two set in (28) is a disjoint union of whole internal
cycles, and

```text
M_c mod 2
  = (total order of the all-triangle-free internal cycles in c) mod 2. (30)
```

This removes arbitrary cycle runs from the residual.  The exact remaining
question is whether the triangle-free/antipodal color trace forces the total
order in (30) to be even for every normalized size-two defect component, or
only after summing across components.  Commutation and row sums alone stop at
(28); the proved 0-or-2 propagation sharpens the missing input to the
componentwise parity in (30).

In particular, (30) is automatically even when `G[c]` is a single internal
cycle: its all-triangle-free order is either zero or the full order `2q`.
The parity residual exists only for a size-two defect component containing at
least two internal cycles, with an odd total order among the all-triangle-free
ones.  This cleanly separates the already harmless connected internal-cycle
case from the genuine mixed-cycle case.

There is a stronger sectorwise conclusion.  Under the full-support
`-2` alternating-eigenline hypotheses, the banked theorem
`binarySquare_regular_sizeTwoPart_internalCycle_even_six_le` says that
**every** connected component of `G[c]` has even order.  Consequently every
all-triangle-free internal cycle has even order separately, and (30) gives

```text
M_c = 0  (mod 2)                                             (31)
```

for an arbitrary number of internal cycles.  Thus the multi-cycle parity
residual is absent throughout the full-support `-2` sector, not only in its
single-cycle subcase.  Any genuinely odd residual in (30) requires failure
of that hypothesis (for example, no full-support `-2` eigenline, or a
candidate `-2` eigenvector vanishing on an internal cycle).  This does not
exclude other signed joint eigenvalues `mu`; it routes the residue away from
the specifically alternating `mu=-2` cell toward the transport/other-mode
side of the dispatcher.

The same elementary recurrence sharpens that routing.  Suppose more
generally that `s` is full-support with values in `{+1,-1}` and

```text
A_c s = mu s.
```

At a vertex, the two neighboring signs sum to `-2`, `0`, or `2` times the
sign at that vertex.  Since `mu` is common to the whole component,

```text
mu in {-2,0,2}.                                             (32)
```

For `mu=-2`, signs alternate at every step, so each internal cycle is even.
For `mu=0`, the cycle recurrence is `s_(i+2)=-s_i`, whose nonzero sign
pattern has exact period four; every internal cycle therefore has order
divisible by four.  Both modes force `M_c` even by (30).  Consequently an
odd collision residue can coexist with a full-support signed joint eigenline
only in the internal `mu=2` mode (where signs are constant on each internal
cycle), or else in the no-full-support-signed-eigenline transport branch.
This isolates the residue more sharply than the `-2` statement alone; it
does not claim that the `mu=2` mode is itself realizable.

The `mu=2` branch cannot be closed from the commuting exterior-pair quotient
alone.  There is an explicit abstract model on sixteen points.  Split the
points into two sign shores of order eight and put

```text
H_+ = H_- = C3 disjoint_union C5.
```

On the two shore copies, let `Z` be the bipartite two-regular relation which,
on each corresponding cycle, joins a vertex to its copy and to the copy of
its successor.  Put `X=J-Z` and

```text
H = diag(H_+,H_-),             R = [[0,X],[X^T,0]].
```

Then `R` is connected, bipartite, and six-regular; `HR=RH`; and for the sign
vector `s=(1^8,-1^8)` one has

```text
Hs = 2s,                       Rs = -6s.                 (33)
```

The four-cycle quotient of `R`, with component order
`(C3_+,C5_+,C3_-,C5_-)`, is

```text
[[0,0,1,5],
 [0,0,3,3],
 [1,5,0,0],
 [3,3,0,0]].
```

It satisfies row sum six, weighted reciprocity, the target-size bounds, and
the diagonal separation bound `0+3 <= |C|`.  The pointwise separation input
also holds: an `R`-edge crosses the sign shores, while the two `H`-neighbor
sets lie in different shores and hence have empty intersection.

If only `C3_+` is declared all-triangle-free, the residue in (30) is odd.
This declaration is deliberately not asserted to arise from an ambient
graph: its role is to prove that **all currently banked `H/R` quotient and
joint-eigenline data leave the triangle-free cycle selector free enough to
carry odd parity**.  Thus the remaining `mu=2` consumer must use an identity
involving the second-order defect block (or the ambient triangle owner data),
not merely shore balance, commutation, regularity, separation, or the
component quotient ledger.  Equivalently, it must couple the selector to
the `R` quotient rather than treating it as an arbitrary union of internal
cycles.

That coupling is supplied by
`exteriorPairGraph_adj_iff_not_defect_and_no_internal_common`.  In the
`mu=2` joint line, `s` is constant on each internal cycle, while every
`R`-edge reverses `s`; hence no two vertices on the same internal cycle are
`R`-adjacent.  Now take an internal ambient edge `xy`.

* If its cycle is a `C3`, the third vertex is an internal common neighbor of
  `x,y`.  Thus `xy` is not a second-order defect edge and the entire cycle is
  all-triangle.
* If its cycle has order at least four, adjacent cycle vertices have no
  internal common neighbor.  They are not `R`-adjacent, so the adjacency
  criterion forces them to be second-order defect adjacent.  Since `xy` is
  already an ambient edge, it cannot be antipodal; it is a triangle-free
  edge.  Thus the entire cycle is all-triangle-free.

Consequently the formerly arbitrary selector is exact:

```text
all-triangle cycles = the internal C3 components,
all-triangle-free cycles = every other internal cycle.       (34)
```

Because the size-two component has even order `2q`, equations (30) and (34)
give the generic reduction

```text
M_c mod 2 = (# internal C3 components) mod 2.                 (35)
```

This also explains why the abstract model above needed the deliberately
non-ambient declaration that `C3_+` was all-triangle-free: the actual defect
adjacency bridge forbids precisely that declaration.

At `q=8`, (35) closes the `mu=2` residue using only the four-cycle quotient
ledger.  Each sign shore has order eight and is a disjoint union of cycles
of order at least three, with no `C4` because the ambient graph is C4-free.
Its shape is therefore either `C8` or `C3 disjoint_union C5`.  The two shores
cannot have different shapes: if a `C8` shore faced a `C3+C5` shore, weighted
reciprocity for the `R` quotient would make the per-vertex `C8`--`C3` entry a
multiple of three.  Entry zero would force the `C8`--`C5` entry to be six,
exceeding the target size five; entry three would force the reverse
`C3`--`C8` entry to be eight, exceeding the six-regular row sum.  Therefore
the shores have the same shape and contain either zero or two triangles.
By (35), `M_c` is even.  This is a structural `q=8` corollary, not a census;
in fact the same quotient ledger closes the triangle parity uniformly.

Let the internal cycles be split between the two sign shores, and write
`n_a` for their orders.  Since `R` has degree `q-2` and only crosses the
shores, define its componentwise bipartite complement by

```text
z_ab = n_b - componentQuotientMatrix(R,H,a,b).
```

The target-size bound makes `z_ab` nonnegative, and the quotient identities
give

```text
sum_b z_ab = 2,                 n_a z_ab = n_b z_ba.     (36)
```

Thus every nonzero `z_ab` is one or two.  Regard these entries as weights on
the bipartite support graph of internal cycles.  A node of order three has
only the following possibilities, forced by weighted reciprocity:

* a weight-one edge can only meet another order-three node, again with
  reverse weight one;
* a weight-two edge meets either an order-three node with reverse weight two,
  or an order-six node with reverse weight one.

The row sum two now classifies every support component which contains an
order-three node.  Weight-one order-three nodes form a bipartite cycle, so
there are evenly many of them.  A weight-two `3--3` edge is an isolated pair.
Finally, a weight-two `3--6` edge makes the order-three endpoint a leaf and
leaves one unit at the order-six endpoint.  Reciprocity says that every
subsequent weight-one edge goes to another order-six node (reverse weight
one) or to an order-three leaf (reverse weight two).  Hence the finite
component is a path

```text
C3 -- C6 -- ... -- C6 -- C3,
```

again with exactly two order-three endpoints.  Therefore

```text
# internal C3 components = 0  (mod 2).                    (37)
```

Combining (35) and (37) gives the uniform signed-mode terminal

```text
full-support signed joint eigenline  ==>  M_c = 0 (mod 2). (38)
```

The modes `mu=-2,0` were closed by cycle-length divisibility; the `mu=2`
mode is closed by the defect-selector bridge and the two-regular complement
quotient above.  Consequently any odd collision residue is now confined to
the transport/no-full-support-signed-eigenline side of the dispatcher.  The
remaining task is no longer a signed-mode parity question.

## 9. Exact transport-side trace target

The same defect/exterior-pair adjacency bridge removes the cycle selector
even without a signed line.  Let `H=A_c` be the internal ambient two-factor,
let `R` be its exterior-pair graph, and let `t_3(H)` be the number of internal
`C3` components.  The cycle-sector dichotomy and the adjacency criterion give
an exact trichotomy.

* A `C3` is all-triangle, but none of its ambient edges belongs to `R`, since
  the third vertex is an internal common neighbor.
* On every longer all-triangle cycle, an ambient cycle edge is not a defect
  edge and has no internal common neighbor, so it is an `R`-edge.
* On every longer all-triangle-free cycle, an ambient cycle edge is a defect
  edge, so it is not an `R`-edge.

Consequently

```text
|E(H) cap E(R)|
  = total order of the longer all-triangle internal cycles. (39)
```

The component has even order `2q`.  Partitioning that order among the three
classes above and using (30) yields

```text
M_c = |E(H) cap E(R)| + t_3(H)  (mod 2).                (40)
```

Both terms have canonical trace forms:

```text
trace(H R) = 2 |E(H) cap E(R)|,
trace(H^3) = 6 t_3(H).                                  (41)
```

Thus the entire collision-parity problem, including the transport branch,
is equivalent to the single mixed trace congruence

```text
trace(H^3 + 3 H R) = 0  (mod 12).                       (42)
```

Here (40)--(42) retain the even-`q` triangle-free degree `0/2` and
cycle-propagation hypotheses used in (30); they are not assertions about an
arbitrary commuting pair of graphs.

The signed-mode argument above proves (42) whenever the exterior-pair bottom
line supplies a full-support `{+1,-1}` joint eigenvector.  In the other horn,
`B^T` transports every relevant nonprincipal internal mode to the exterior
adjacency block with negated eigenvalue.  Therefore (42), rather than another
cycle-by-cycle selector analysis, is the precise remaining transport-side
consumer.  A proof must use the transported exterior spectrum or the
simultaneous routing partition; commutation and ordinary quotient row sums
alone do not distinguish the two summands in (40).

There is also an exact graph interpretation of (42).  Let `B` be the
incidence block from `c` to its complement and form the spanning subgraph
which deletes all edges wholly outside `c`, with adjacency matrix

```text
S = [[H,B],[B^T,0]].
```

The exterior Gram identity is `B B^T=(q-2)I+R`.  Since `trace(H)=0`, a block
cube expansion gives

```text
trace(S^3)
  = trace(H^3) + 3 trace(H B B^T)
  = trace(H^3 + 3 H R).                                 (43)
```

Thus (42) is equivalently the assertion that this canonical spanning
subgraph has an even number of triangles.  Its degree sequence is especially
rigid: the `2q` vertices of `c` have degree `q`, every exterior vertex has
degree two, the exterior vertices form an independent set, and C4-freeness
is inherited from `G`.  Its triangles are exactly the internal `C3`s and the
subdivided exterior-pair edges which also lie in `H`, reproducing (40).
This packages the transport target as a pure parity theorem for a C4-free
even-degree split graph, while retaining the self-indexed origin of its
degree-two side.

Finally, (43) reconnects directly to the simultaneous owner colors.  Let
`F_d[c]` be the owner-`d` two-factor on `c`.  For `d != c`, every edge of
`F_d[c]` has its unique common neighbor in the exterior component `d`, so
the exterior-pair graph is the disjoint owner sum

```text
R = disjoint_union_(d != c) F_d[c].                      (44)
```

For the self color, (20) gives `F_c[c]=H^2-2I`.  Hence its intersection with
`H` consists exactly of the three edges of every internal `C3`, and

```text
|E(H) cap E(F_c[c])| = 3 t_3(H).                         (45)
```

Combining (40), (44), and (45) yields the fully colored form

```text
M_c = sum_d |E(H) cap E(F_d[c])|  (mod 2).               (46)
```

The factors `F_d[c]` edge-partition the selector complement of `D[c]`, so
(46) is also the parity of the internal ambient edges which are assigned an
owner color rather than lying in the triangle-free defect sector.  This is
algebraically equivalent to (42), but it is the form visible to (SRP): each
exterior color is built from a cross incidence block reused in every routing
partition, and the self color is the distinguished distance-two factor.
Thus the next simultaneous-routing statement can be phrased sharply as

```text
sum_d |E(A_c) cap E(F_d[c])| is even.                    (47)
```

Proving (47) from the coupled endpoint partitions closes the transport horn;
ordinary factor degrees or the uncolored owner partition merely restate it.

## 10. The first SRP contraction and its exact blind spot

For distinct components `c,e`, put

```text
p_ce = |E(A_c) cap E(F_e[c])|,
tau_ced = number of ambient triangles with one vertex in each of c,e,d.
```

Multiply (SRP) on the right by `R_ec=R_ce^T` and take the trace.  Cyclicity
of trace and the owner-factor interpretation give

```text
trace(A_c R_ce R_ec) = 2 p_ce,
trace(R_ce A_e R_ec) = 2 p_ec,
trace(R_cd R_de R_ec) = tau_ced.
```

Since every cross block has row sum two,
`trace(J R_ec)=4q`.  Therefore the contraction is the exact pair law

```text
2(p_ce + p_ec) + sum_(d != c,e) tau_ced = 4q.            (48)
```

In particular the three-component sum in (48) is even, and

```text
p_ce + p_ec
  = (1/2) sum_(d != c,e) tau_ced  (mod 2).               (49)
```

Summing (48) over all unordered component pairs shows that the total number
of three-distinct-component triangles is even and determines the parity of
the global exterior-owner mass.  But (48) has a precise blind spot: it sees
only the symmetric combinations `p_ce+p_ec`, whereas the target (47) is the
directed row sum

```text
p_cc + sum_(e != c) p_ce.
```

Thus this natural SRP trace contraction collapses to the already known
unoriented triangle inventory and cannot close a componentwise collision
parity.  A genuinely new consumer must retain the direction of the owner
transfer—equivalently, compare `p_ce` with `p_ec` rather than immediately
adding them.  Endpoint-marked rows such as (10)--(14), or a nonsymmetric
test matrix inserted before taking trace, are the remaining routes to that
information.
