Are\[2^n\pm 1\]and\[n!\pm 1\]powerful (i.e. if $p\mid m$ then $p^2\mid m$) for only finitely many $n$?



Cushing and Pascoe \cite{CuPa16} have shown the answer to the second question is yes assuming the abc conjecture - in fact, for any fixed $k\geq 0$, there are only finitely many $n$ and powerful $x$ such that $\lvert x-n!\rvert \leq k$.

CrowdMath \cite{Cr20} has shown that the answer to the first question is yes, again assuming the abc conjecture.
