# Problem: Erdős #1068

## Statement

### Plain Language
Does every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ contain a countable subgraph which is infinitely connected?



A question of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. We say a graph is infinitely connected if any two vertices are connected by infinitely many pairwise disjoint paths.

See also [1067].
