Let $A\subset \{ x\in \mathbb{R}^2 : \lvert x\rvert <r\}$ be a measurable set with no integer distances, that is, such that $\lvert a-b\rvert \not\in \mathbb{Z}$ for any distinct $a,b\in A$. How large can the measure of $A$ be?



A problem of Erd\H{o}s and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zi. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er77c} writes that 'S\'{a}rk\"{o}zi has the sharpest results, but nothing has been published yet'.

The trivial upper bound is $O(r)$. Kovac has observed that S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy's lower bound in [466] can be adapted to give a lower bound of $\gg r^{0.26}$ for this problem.

See also [465] for a similar problem (concerning upper bounds) and [466] for a similar problem (concerning lower bounds).
