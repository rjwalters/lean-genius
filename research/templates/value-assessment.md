## Expected Value Calculation

```
Significance (S):     ___
Novelty (N):          ___
Strategic (W):        ___
Tractability (T):     ___

Tractability_Factor = 0.3 + 0.7 × (T / 10) = ___

Expected_Value = S × (N + W) × Tractability_Factor
               = ___ × (___ + ___) × ___
               = ___
```
