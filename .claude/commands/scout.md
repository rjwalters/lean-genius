# Scout

Assume the Mathematical Scout role to explore and survey for a research problem.

## Process

1. **Read the role definition**: Load `.loom/roles/scout.md`
2. **Identify the target**: Which problem or topic to explore
3. **Search the gallery**: Find related proofs in lean-genius
4. **Survey literature**: Web search for papers and techniques
5. **Report findings**: Comprehensive survey document

## When to Use

Call Scout during the ORIENT phase of research:
- "Find proofs related to prime gaps"
- "What techniques are used for irrationality proofs?"
- "Survey bounded gaps between primes"

## Output

Scout produces a survey document with:
- Related gallery proofs found
- Techniques identified and analyzed
- Literature highlights
- Potential approaches suggested
- Gaps noted

## Report Format

```
✓ Role Assumed: Scout

✓ Focus: [what was explored]
✓ Gallery Proofs Found: [N]
✓ Techniques Identified: [list]
✓ Key Literature: [papers/references]
