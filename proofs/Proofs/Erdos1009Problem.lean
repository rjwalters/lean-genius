  Is it true that, for every $c>0$, there exists $f(c)$ such that every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+k$ edges, where $k<c n$, contains at least $k-f(c)$ many edge disjoint triangles?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s proved this for $c<1/2$ using a theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, which says that every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $(n-1)^2/4+2$ many edges, with chromatic number $3$...
