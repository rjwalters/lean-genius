  If $G$ is a graph which contains odd cycles of $\leq k$ different lengths then $\chi(G)\leq 2k+2$, with equality if and only if $G$ contains $K_{2k+2}$.
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Bollob\'{a}s and Erd\H{o}s. Bollob\'{a}s and Shelah have confirmed this for $k=1$. Proved by Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s \cite{Gy92}, who proved the stronger result that, if $G$ is 2-connected, then $G$ is either $K_{2k+2}$ or contains a ...
