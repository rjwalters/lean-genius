  For any $g\geq 2$, if $n$ is sufficiently large and $\equiv 1,3\pmod{6}$ then there exists a 3-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices such that
  {UL}
  {LI}every pair of vertices is contained in exactly one edge (i.e. the graph is a Steiner triple system) and{/LI}
  {LI}for any $2\leq j\leq g$ any collection of $j$ edges contains at least $j+3$ vertices.{/LI}
  {/UL}
