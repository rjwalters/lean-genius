  Show that for any rational $\alpha \in [1,2)$ there exists a bipartite graph $G$ such that\[\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\asymp n^{\alpha}.\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits.
  
  Bukh and Conlon \cite{BuCo18} proved that this holds if we weaken asking for the extremal number of a single graph to asking for the extremal number of a finite family of graphs.
