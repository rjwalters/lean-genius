  Let $W(3,k)$ be the van der Waerden number defined as the minimum $n$ such that in any red/blue colouring of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ there exists either a red $3$-term arithmetic progression or a blue $k$-term arithmetic progression.
  
  Give reasonable bounds for $W(3,k)$. In particular, give any non-trivial lower bounds for $W(3,k)$ and prove that $W(3,k) < \exp(k^c)$ for some constant $c<1$.
