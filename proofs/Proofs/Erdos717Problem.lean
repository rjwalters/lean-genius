  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $\chi(G)$ and let $\sigma(G)$ be the maximal $k$ such that $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_k$. Is it true that\[\chi(G) \ll \frac{n^{1/2}}{\log n}\sigma(G)?\]
  
  
  
  Haj\'{o}s originally conjectured that $\chi(G)\leq \sigma(G)$, which was proved by Dirac \cite{Di52} when $\chi(G)=4$. Catlin \cite{Ca74} disproved Haj\'{o}s' conjecture for all...
