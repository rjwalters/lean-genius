  Statement:
  Let f(n)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n)f(n)f(n) be minimal such that there is a tournament (a complete directed graph) on f(n)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n)f(n)f(n) vertices such that every set of n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">nnn vertices is dominated by at least one other vertex. Estimate f(n)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n)f(n)f(n).
