  The independent set sequence of any tree or forest is unimodal.
  
  In other words, if $i_k(G)$ counts the number of independent sets of vertices of size $k$ in a graph $G$, and $T$ is any tree or forest, then for some $m\geq 0$
  $$i_{0}(T)\leq i_{1}(T)\leq\cdots\leq i_{m}(T)\geq i_{m+1}(T)\geq i_{m+2}(T)\geq\cdots.$$
