  Let $g(n)$ be the maximal size of $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that the products $\prod_{n\in S}n$ are distinct for all $S\subseteq A$. Is it true that\[g(n) \leq \pi(n)+\pi(n^{1/2})+o\left(\frac{x^{1/2}}{\log n}\right)?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s proved \cite{Er66}\[g(n) \leq \pi(n)+O\left(\frac{x^{1/2}}{\log n}\right).\]This upper bound would be essentially best possible, since one could take $A$ to ...
