  Status: SOLVED
  Prize: $500

  Statement:
  Let $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ be an infinite set such that the triple sums $a+b+c$ are all distinct for $a,b,c\in A$ (aside from the trivial coincidences). Is it true that\[\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/3}}=0?\] Erdős proved that if the pairwise sums $a+b$ are all distinct aside from the trivial coincidences then\[\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}=0.\]This is discussed in problem C11 of Guy's collection [Gu04], in which Guy says Erdős offered \$500 f...
