  Let $w(n)$ count the number of solutions to\[n=2^a+3^b+2^c3^d\]with $a,b,c,d\geq 0$ integers. Is it true that $w(n)$ is bounded by some absolute constant?
  
  
  
  A conjecture originally due to Newman.
  
  This is true, and was proved by Evertse, Gy\"{o}ry, Stewart, and Tijdeman \cite{EGST88}.
  
  Quantitative bounds were provided by Tijdeman and Wang \cite{TiWa88}, who proved that (if $w(n)$ only...
