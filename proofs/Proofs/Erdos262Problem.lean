  Suppose $a_1<a_2<\cdots$ is a sequence of integers such that for all integer sequences $t_n$ with $t_n\geq 1$ the sum\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{t_na_n}\]is irrational. How slowly can $a_n$ grow?
  
  
  
  One possible definition of an 'irrationality sequence' (see also [263] and [264]). An example of such a sequence is $a_n=2^{2^n}$ (proved by Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75c}), while a non-example is $a_n=n!$...
