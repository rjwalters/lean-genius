  Are the only solutions to\[n!=x^2-1\]when $n=4,5,7$?
  
  
  
  The Brocard-Ramanujan conjecture. Erd\H{o}s and Graham describe this as an old conjecture, and write it 'is almost certainly true but it is intractable at present'.
  
  Overholt \cite{Ov93} has shown that this has only finitely many solutions assuming a weak form of the ABC conjecture.
  
  There are no other solutions below $10^9$ (see t...
