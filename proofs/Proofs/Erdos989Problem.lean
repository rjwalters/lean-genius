  If $A=\{z_1,z_2,\ldots \}\in \mathbb{R}^2$ is an infinite sequence then let\[f(r)=\max_C \left\lvert \lvert A\cap C\rvert-\pi r^2\right\rvert,\]where the maximum is taken over all circles $C$ of radius $r$.
  
  Is $f(r)$ unbounded for every $A$? How fast does $f(r)$ grow?
  
  
  
  This was settled by Beck \cite{Be87}, who proved that\[f(r) \gg r^{1/2}\]for all $A$, and there exists $A$ such that\[f(...
