  "overview": "Let A ⊆ ℕ satisfy: (1) |A ∩ [1,2x]| - |A ∩ [1,x]| → ∞ and (2) Σ{θn} = ∞ for all θ ∈ (0,1), where {x} = dist(x,ℤ). Conjecture: Every sufficiently large integer is a sum of distinct elements of A. Cassels (1960) proved this under stronger conditions; original conjecture remains open.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - Cassels (1960) proved a related result under stronger hypotheses: faster growth (divided by log log x) and squared fractional sums. The gap between Erdős's conditions and Cassels's remains to be closed.",
