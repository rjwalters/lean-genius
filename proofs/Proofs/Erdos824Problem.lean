  Let $h(x)$ count the number of integers $1\leq a<b<x$ such that $(a,b)=1$ and $\sigma(a)=\sigma(b)$, where $\sigma$ is the sum of divisors function.
  
  Is it true that $h(x)>x^{2-o(1)}$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er74b} proved that $\limsup h(x)/x= \infty$, and claimed a similar proof for this problem. A complete proof that $h(x)/x\to \infty$ was provided by Pollack and Pomerance \cite{PoPo16}.
