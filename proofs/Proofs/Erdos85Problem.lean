Erdős Problem #85: Minimum Degree for 4-Cycles

Let f(n) be the smallest integer such that every graph on n vertices with
minimum degree ≥ f(n) contains a 4-cycle (C₄).

Is it true that f(n+1) ≥ f(n) for all large n?

**Status**: OPEN

**Known Results**:
- f(n) = (1 + o(1))√n asymptotically
- f(n) < √n + 1
- f(4) = 2
- Connected to Ramsey number R(C₄, K_{1,n})

## Background

A **4-cycle** (or C₄) is a cycle on 4 vertices: a-b-c-d-a with exactly
these 4 edges. It's the simplest even cycle.

The **minimum degree** of a graph is the smallest degree of any vertex.
High minimum degree forces certain substructures to appear.

This problem asks: what minimum degree guarantees a C₄?
-/

/--
The **4-cycle graph** C₄ on 4 vertices, where vertex i is adjacent to
vertices i-1 and i+1 (mod 4).

This is a cycle: 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 0.
-/
def C4 : SimpleGraph (Fin 4) where
  Adj := fun i j => (i.val + 1) % 4 = j.val ∨ (j.val + 1) % 4 = i.val
  symm := fun i j h => by cases h <;> simp_all [or_comm]
  loopless := fun i h => by fin_cases i <;> simp_all

/--
A graph G **contains a 4-cycle** if C₄ is a subgraph of G.
We use the notion of graph homomorphism embedding.
-/
def containsC4 (V : Type*) (G : SimpleGraph V) : Prop :=
  ∃ (f : Fin 4 → V), Function.Injective f ∧
    ∀ i j, C4.Adj i j → G.Adj (f i) (f j)

/--
**f(n)** is the minimum degree threshold such that every n-vertex graph
with minimum degree ≥ f(n) contains a 4-cycle.

Formally: f(n) = min{k : ∀ G on n vertices, minDeg(G) ≥ k → C₄ ⊆ G}
-/
noncomputable def minDegreeForC4 (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  sInf {k : ℕ | ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
    G.minDegree ≥ k → containsC4 (Fin n) G}

## The Main Question

Erdős asked whether f is eventually monotone: f(n+1) ≥ f(n) for large n.
-/

/--
**Erdős Problem #85 (OPEN)**

Is f(n) eventually non-decreasing? That is, for all sufficiently large n,
does f(n+1) ≥ f(n)?

We state this without asserting its truth value.
-/
def Erdos85Question : Prop :=
  ∀ᶠ n in atTop, minDegreeForC4 n ≤ minDegreeForC4 (n + 1)

/--
The negation: there exist arbitrarily large n where f(n+1) < f(n).
-/
def Erdos85Negation : Prop :=
  ∀ N : ℕ, ∃ n ≥ N, minDegreeForC4 (n + 1) < minDegreeForC4 n

/-!
## Known Bounds

The asymptotic behavior of f(n) is well-understood.
-/

/--
**Asymptotic Upper Bound**

f(n) < √n + 1 for all n ≥ 4.

This means if minimum degree exceeds √n, a 4-cycle must exist.
-/
axiom minDegreeForC4_upperBound :
  ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 4 → minDegreeForC4 n < Nat.sqrt n + 1

/--
**Asymptotic Behavior**

f(n) = (1 + o(1))√n as n → ∞.

The minimum degree threshold grows like the square root of n.
-/
axiom minDegreeForC4_asymptotic :
  Tendsto (fun n => (minDegreeForC4 n : ℝ) / Real.sqrt n) atTop (𝓝 1)

/--
**Base Case**: f(4) = 2.

In a graph on 4 vertices, minimum degree ≥ 2 guarantees a 4-cycle.
(In fact, such a graph must be the 4-cycle itself.)
-/
axiom minDegreeForC4_base : minDegreeForC4 4 = 2

/-!
## Connection to Ramsey Numbers

The function f(n) is intimately connected to the Ramsey number R(C₄, K_{1,n}).
-/

/--
The **star graph** K_{1,n} has one central vertex connected to n leaves.
-/
def starGraph (n : ℕ) : SimpleGraph (Fin (n + 1)) where
  Adj := fun i j => (i = 0 ∧ j ≠ 0) ∨ (j = 0 ∧ i ≠ 0)
  symm := fun i j h => by cases h <;> simp_all [or_comm]
  loopless := fun i h => by cases h <;> simp_all

/--
**Ramsey Connection**

The Ramsey number R(C₄, K_{1,n}) is related to f by:
  R(C₄, K_{1,n}) = min{m : f(m) ≤ m - n}

And conversely:
  f(n) = min{m : m ≥ R(C₄, K_{1,n-m})}

This reformulation connects the degree threshold problem to Ramsey theory.
-/
def ramseyConnection : Prop :=
  ∀ n m : ℕ, n ≥ 4 → m ≥ n →
    (minDegreeForC4 m ≤ m - n) ↔
    (∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin m)) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
      containsC4 (Fin m) G ∨ ∃ v, G.degree v ≥ n)

/-!
## Weaker Conjecture

A weaker version asks whether f is "almost monotone"—it can decrease,
but only by a bounded amount.
-/

/--
**Weaker Conjecture**

There exists a constant c such that for all m > n,
  f(m) > f(n) - c

This allows f to occasionally decrease, but by at most c.
-/
def WeakerConjecture : Prop :=
  ∃ c : ℕ, ∀ m n : ℕ, m > n → n ≥ 4 →
    minDegreeForC4 m + c > minDegreeForC4 n

## Historical Notes

This problem explores the extremal theory of even cycles. The 4-cycle (C₄)
is special because:
- It's the smallest even cycle
- It appears in the Kővári–Sós–Turán theorem
- It's connected to the Zarankiewicz problem

The monotonicity question is subtle because adding vertices might create
"room" for C₄-avoiding configurations with high minimum degree.
-/

/--
The Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem gives bounds on C₄-free graphs:
A C₄-free graph on n vertices has at most (1/2)n^{3/2} + n/2 edges.
-/
axiom kovariSosTuran :
  ∀ n : ℕ, ∀ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) [DecidableRel G.Adj],
    ¬containsC4 (Fin n) G →
    G.edgeFinset.card ≤ n^2 / 4 + n / 2
