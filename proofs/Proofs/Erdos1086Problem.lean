  Let $g(n)$ be minimal such that any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contains the vertices of at most $g(n)$ many triangles with the same area. Estimate $g(n)$.
  
  
  
  Equivalently, how many triangles of area $1$ can a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ determine? Erd\H{o}s and Purdy attribute this question to Oppenheim. Erd\H{o}s and Purdy \cite{ErPu71} proved\[n^2\log\log n \ll g(n) \ll n^{5/...
