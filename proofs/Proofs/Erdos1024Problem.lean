  Let $f(n)$ be such that every $3$-uniform linear hypergraph on $n$ vertices contains an independent set on $f(n)$ vertices. Estimate $f(n)$.
  
  
  
  A hypergraph is linear if $\lvert A\cap B\rvert\leq 1$ for all edges $A$ and $B$. An independent set of vertices is one which contains no edges. A $3$-uniform linear hypergraph is sometimes called a partial Steiner triple system.
