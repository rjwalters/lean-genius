  Are there infinitely many solutions to $\phi(n)=\phi(n+1)$, where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er85e} says that, presumably, for every $k\geq 1$ the equation\[\phi(n)=\phi(n+1)=\cdots=\phi(n+k)\]has infinitely many solutions.
  
  Erd\H{o}s, Pomerance, and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy \cite{EPS87} proved that the number of $n\leq x$ with $\phi(n)=\phi(n+1)$ is at most\[\frac{x}{\...
