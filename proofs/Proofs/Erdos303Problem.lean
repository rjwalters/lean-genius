  Is it true that in any finite colouring of the integers there exists a monochromatic solution to\[\frac{1}{a}=\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\]with distinct $a,b,c$?
  
  
  
  The density version of this is [302]. This colouring version is true, as proved by Brown and R\"{o}dl \cite{BrRo91}.
  
  This problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.
