  "overview": "Let N(X,δ) be the max points in a circle of radius X with pairwise distances at least δ from integers. Questions: (1) Is N(X,δ) = o(X)? (2) Is N(X,δ) < X^{1/2+o(1)}?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED - Both conjectures proved. Sárközy (1976): N(X,δ) ≪ δ⁻³ · X / log log X. Konyagin (2001): N(X,δ) ≪_δ X^{1/2} which is OPTIMAL (lower bound from Problem #466 shows N(X,δ) ≫_δ X^{1/2}).",
