  Let $A_1(N)$ be the number of maximal Sidon subsets of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$. Is it true that\[A_1(N) < 2^{o(N^{1/2})}?\]Is it true that\[A_1(N) > 2^{N^c}\]for some constant $c>0$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Cameron and Erd\H{o}s.
  
  This is resolved as a consequence of results of Saxton and Thomason \cite{SaTh15} - they prove that there number of Sidon sets in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ is at least $2^{(1.16+o(1))N^{...
