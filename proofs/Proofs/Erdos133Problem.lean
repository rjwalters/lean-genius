  Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that every triangle-free graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and diameter $2$ contains a vertex with degree $\geq f(n)$.
  
  What is the order of growth of $f(n)$? Does $f(n)/\sqrt{n}\to \infty$?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Pach. The lower bound $f(n)\geq (1-o(1))\sqrt{n}$ follows from the fact that a graph with maximum degree $d$ and diameter $2$ has at most $1+d+d(d-1)=d^2+1...
