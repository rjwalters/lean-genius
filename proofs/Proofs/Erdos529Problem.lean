  Let $d_k(n)$ be the expected distance from the origin after taking $n$ random steps from the origin in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (conditional on no self intersections) - that is, a self-avoiding walk. Is it true that\[\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{d_2(n)}{n^{1/2}}= \infty?\]Is it true that\[d_k(n)\ll n^{1/2}\]for $k\geq 3$?
  
  
  
  Slade \cite{Sl87} proved that, for $k$ sufficiently large, $d_k(n)\sim Dn^{1/2}$ for ...
