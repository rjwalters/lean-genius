  "overview": "Let n ≥ 2 and π(n) < k ≤ n. Define f(k,n) as the smallest integer r such that in any A ⊆ {1,...,n} of size |A| = k, there exist primes p₁,...,pᵣ covering at least r elements of A (as smooth numbers). Does 2π(√n) - f(π(n)+1, n) → ∞?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "NO - Erdős and Straus (1970) proved f(π(n)+1, n) = 2π(√n) + o(√n/(log n)^A) for any A > 0. The difference does not tend to infinity; it is sublinear in √n. They also showed f(cn, n) = log log n + O(√(log log n)) for constant 0 < c < 1.",
