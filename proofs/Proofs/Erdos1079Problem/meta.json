  "overview": "For r ≥ 4: If G has n vertices and ≥ ex(n; K_r) edges, must G contain a vertex with degree d ≫ n whose neighborhood has ≥ ex(d; K_{r-1}) edges?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES (unless G is the Turán graph). Bollobás-Thomason (1981) proved the statement. Bondy (1983) strengthened it by showing the max-degree vertex always works. This is a 'nice generalisation of Turán's theorem' as Erdős hoped.",
