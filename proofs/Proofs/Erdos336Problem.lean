  For $r\geq 2$ let $h(r)$ be the maximal finite $k$ such that there exists a basis $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of order $r$ (so every large integer is the sum of at most $r$ integers from $A$) and exact order $k$ (so every large integer is the sum of exactly $k$ integers from $A$).
  
  Find the value of\[\lim_r \frac{h(r)}{r^2}.\]
  
  
  
  A simple example of the order of a basis differing from the exact...
