  Let $k\geq 2$ and $G$ be a graph with $n\geq k-1$ vertices and\[(k-1)(n-k+2)+\binom{k-2}{2}+1\]edges. Does there exist some $c_k>0$ such that $G$ must contain an induced subgraph on at most $(1-c_k)n$ vertices with minimum degree at least $k$?
  
  
  
  The case $k=3$ was a problem of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal \cite{Er91}. The question for general $k$ was a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and S...
