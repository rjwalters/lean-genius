  "overview": "The cochromatic number ζ(G) is the minimum number of colors needed to color vertices such that each color class induces a clique or independent set. Let z(n) = max{ζ(G) : |V(G)| = n}. Determine z(n) for small n; in particular, is z(12) = 4?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED: z(12) = 4 (Bhavik Mehta, computational). Known values for n=1..19: {1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6,6}. Mehta identified the unique graph (up to complement) on 12 vertices where both G and Ḡ are K₄-free with χ ≥ 5. Asymptotic: z(n) ~ n/log n (Gimbel). z(20) remains unknown (6 or 7).",
