  Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest subset $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that every $n\in A+A$ is squarefree. Estimate $f(N)$. In particular, is it true that $f(N)\leq N^{o(1)}$, or even $f(N) \leq (\log N)^{O(1)}$?
  
  
  
  First studied by Erd\H{o}s and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy \cite{ErSa87}, who proved\[\log N \ll f(N) \ll N^{3/4}\log N,\]and guessed the lower bound is nearer the truth. S\'{a}rk\"{o}z...
