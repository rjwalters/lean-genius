  "overview": "Let g_k(n) be the largest |A| for A ⊆ {1,...,n} such that every m has < k solutions to m = a₁a₂ with a₁ < a₂ ∈ A. Is g₃(n) = (log log n / log n)·n + (c + o(1))·n/(log n)² for some constant c?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - First-order asymptotics known: g₃(n) ~ (log log n / log n)·n (Erdős 1964). Bounds on second-order term known: c₁·n/(log n)² ≤ E₃(n) ≤ c₂·n/(log n)². The exact constant c (if it exists) remains unknown.",
