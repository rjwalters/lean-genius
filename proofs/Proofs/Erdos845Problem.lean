  Let $C>0$. Is it true that the set of integers of the form\[n=b_1+\cdots+b_t\textrm{ with }b_1<\cdots<b_t\]where $b_i=2^{k_i}3^{l_i}$ for $1\leq i\leq t$ and $b_t\leq Cb_1$ has density $0$?
  
  
  
  In \cite{Er92b} Erd\H{o}s wrote 'last year I made the following silly conjecture': every integer $n$ can be written as the sum of distinct integers of the form $2^k3^l$, none of which divide any other. 'I...
