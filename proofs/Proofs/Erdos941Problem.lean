  Are all large integers the sum of at most three powerful numbers (i.e. if $p\mid n$ then $p^2\mid n$)?
  
  
  
  This was given in 1986 in the Oberwolfach problem book as a problem of Erd\H{o}s and Ivi\'{c}. It was proved by Heath-Brown \cite{He88}.
  
  See [1107] for the generalisation to $r$-powerful numbers with $r\geq 3$, and also [940].
