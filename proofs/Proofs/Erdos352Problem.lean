  Is there some $c>0$ such that every measurable $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of measure $\geq c$ contains the vertices of a triangle of area 1?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s (unpublished) proved that this is true if $A$ has infinite measure, or if $A$ is an unbounded set of positive measure (stating in \cite{Er78d} and \cite{Er83d} it 'follows easily from the Lebesgue density theorem').
  
  In \cite{Er78d} and \ci...
