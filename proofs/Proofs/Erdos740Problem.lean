  Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be an infinite cardinal and $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$. Let $r\geq 1$. Must $G$ contain a subgraph of chromatic number $\mathfrak{m}$ which does not contain any odd cycle of length $\leq r$?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. R\"{o}dl proved this is true if $\mathfrak{m}=\aleph_0$ and $r=3$ (see [108] for the finitary version).
  
  More generally...
