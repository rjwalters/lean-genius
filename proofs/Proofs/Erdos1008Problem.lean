  Does every graph with $m$ edges contain a subgraph with $\gg m^{2/3}$ edges which contains no $C_4$?
  
  
  
  Originally asked by Bollob\'{a}s and Erd\H{o}s in 'a colloquium on graph theory at Tihany' with $m^{2/3}$ replaced by $m^{3/4}$. Folkman showed this is false with the counterexample $K_{n,n^2}$, which has $n^3$ edges, and yet every subgraph with $>n^2+\binom{n}{2}$ edges contains a $C_4$.
