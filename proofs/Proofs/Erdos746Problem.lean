  Is it true that, almost surely, a random graph on $n$ vertices with $\geq (\tfrac{1}{2}+\epsilon)n\log n$ edges is Hamiltonian?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi \cite{ErRe66}, who proved that almost surely such a graph has a perfect matching (when $n$ is even).
  
  This is true. P\'{o}sa \cite{Po76} proved that almost surely a random graph with $\geq Cn\log n$ edges is Hamiltonian fo...
