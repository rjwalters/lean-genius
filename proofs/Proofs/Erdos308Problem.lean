  Let $N\geq 1$. What is the smallest integer not representable as the sum of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $\{1,\ldots,N\}$? Is it true that the set of integers representable as such has the shape $\{1,\ldots,m\}$ for some $m$?
  
  
  
  This was essentially solved by Croot \cite{Cr99}, who proved that if $f(N)$ is the smallest integer not representable then\[\left\lfloor\sum_{n\leq N}...
