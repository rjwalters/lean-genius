# The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture

## What This File Contains

This file formalizes the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture** (BSD), one of the seven
Millennium Prize Problems. BSD concerns the deep relationship between the arithmetic
properties of elliptic curves (rational points) and their analytic properties (L-functions).

## The Conjecture

**Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture (Weak Form)**:
For an elliptic curve E over ℚ, the rank of the Mordell-Weil group E(ℚ) equals
the order of vanishing of the L-function L(E, s) at s = 1.

Formally: rank(E(ℚ)) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)

**Full BSD Conjecture (Strong Form)**:
The leading coefficient in the Taylor expansion of L(E, s) at s = 1 is given by:

  lim_{s→1} L(E,s) / (s-1)^r = (Ω · R · |Ш| · ∏ cₚ) / |E(ℚ)_tors|²

where:
- r = rank(E(ℚ)) (algebraic rank)
- Ω = real period of E
- R = regulator of E(ℚ)
- Ш = Shafarevich-Tate group (conjectured to be finite!)
- cₚ = Tamagawa numbers at bad primes p
- E(ℚ)_tors = torsion subgroup

## Status: OPEN CONJECTURE

This file does NOT prove the BSD Conjecture. It provides:
1. Abstract definitions of the key components (elliptic curves, L-functions, ranks)
2. The formal statement of both weak and strong BSD
3. Known cases that ARE proven (rank 0 and rank 1)
4. Educational context about computational evidence and significance

    For good reduction: Lₚ(E, s) = 1 - aₚp⁻ˢ + p¹⁻²ˢ

The Modularity Theorem (Wiles et al.) is essential for BSD because it implies
the L-function has analytic continuation and functional equation.
-/

/-- A modular form of weight k for Γ₀(N) is a holomorphic function on the
    upper half-plane satisfying certain transformation properties and

    for Γ₀(N) such that L(E, s) = L(f, s).

    This is arguably the most important theorem in modern number theory.

BSD predicts this equals the algebraic rank.
-/

    For an elliptic curve E/ℚ:
      rank(E(ℚ)) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)

    In other words, the algebraic rank equals the analytic rank.

    Constructing a proof of this type would resolve one of the Millennium Prize Problems.

    2. **Sha is mysterious**: We cannot compute |Ш| in general.
       Ш can be enormous (examples with |Ш| > 10^8 are known).

    3. **No explicit points**: Even if we prove rank(E) ≥ 2, finding
       explicit generators is computationally hard.

    4. **Analytic difficulties**: Computing ord_{s=1} L(E, s) for rank ≥ 2
       requires careful analysis of higher derivatives.

PART XII: SUMMARY AND SIGNIFICANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -/

/-- Summary of what we know about the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture:

1. **Statement**: rank(E(ℚ)) = ord_{s=1} L(E, s)
   Plus a formula for the leading coefficient involving Ш, Ω, R, cₚ

2. **Proven cases**:
   - Rank 0: If L(E, 1) ≠ 0 then rank = 0 (Kolyvagin)
   - Rank 1: If L(E, 1) = 0, L'(E, 1) ≠ 0 then rank = 1 (Gross-Zagier + Kolyvagin)
   - CM curves with L(E, 1) ≠ 0 (Coates-Wiles)
   - Parity conjecture (Dokchitser-Dokchitser)

3. **Computational evidence**:
   - Verified for millions of curves
   - No counterexamples known
   - Leading coefficient matches to high precision

4. **Why it's hard**:
   - Methods fail for rank ≥ 2
   - Ш is mysterious and potentially huge
   - Finding explicit rational points is computationally difficult

5. **Why it matters**:
   - Connects arithmetic (rational points) to analysis (L-functions)
   - Central to modern number theory
   - Applications to cryptography (elliptic curve cryptography)
   - Resolves ancient problems (congruent numbers)

6. **Status**: Open since 1965, $1M Millennium Prize
