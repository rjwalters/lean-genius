  Let $r\geq 3$ and $k$ be sufficiently large in terms of $r$. Is it true that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $k$ has at least\[\binom{(r-1)(k-1)+1}{r}\]edges, with equality only for the complete graph on $(r-1)(k-1)+1$ vertices?
  
  
  
  When $r=2$ it is a classical fact that chromatic number $k$ implies at least $\binom{k}{2}$ edges. Erd\H{o}s asked for $k$ to be large in this con...
