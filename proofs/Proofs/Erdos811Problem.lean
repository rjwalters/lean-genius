  Suppose $n\equiv 1\pmod{m}$. We say that an edge-colouring of $K_n$ using $m$ colours is balanced if every vertex sees exactly $\lfloor n/m\rfloor$ many edges of each colours.
  
  For which graphs $G$ is it true that, if $m=e(G)$, for all large $n\equiv 1\pmod{m}$, every balanced edge-colouring of $K_n$ with $m$ colours contains a rainbow copy of $G$? (That is, a subgraph isomorphic to $G$ where each ...
