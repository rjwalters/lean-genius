  Let $\tau(n)$ count the divisors of $n$ and $\tau^+(n)$ count the number of $k$ such that $n$ has a divisor in $[2^k,2^{k+1})$. Is it true that, for all $\epsilon>0$,\[\tau^+(n) < \epsilon \tau(n)\]for almost all $n$?
  
  
  
  This is false, and was disproved by Erd\H{o}s and Tenenbaum \cite{ErTe81}, who showed that in fact the upper density of the set of such $n$ is $\asymp \epsilon^{1-o(1)}$ (where...
