  Let $1\leq a_1<\cdots<a_k\leq x$. How many of the partial products $a_1,a_1a_2,\ldots,a_1\cdots a_k$ can be squares? Is it true that, for any $\epsilon>0$, there can be more than $x^{1-\epsilon}$ squares?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham write it is 'trivial' that there are $o(x)$ many such squares, although this is not quite trivial, using Siegel's theorem.
  
  A positive answer follows from work of B...
