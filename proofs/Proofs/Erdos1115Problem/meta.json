  "overview": "For finite-order entire f with f(z) → ∞ along path Γ, can path length ℓ(r) in disc |z|<r satisfy ℓ(r) ≪ r? Find minimal ℓ(r) in terms of max modulus M(r).",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "DISPROVED by Gol'dberg-Eremenko (1979): For any φ(r) → ∞, there exist entire f with log M(r) ≪ φ(r)(log r)² but NO path has ℓ(r) ≪ r. Hayman (1960) showed if log M(r) ≪ (log r)² then rays work. Threshold is (log r)².",
