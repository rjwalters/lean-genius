  Let $k(n)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exists $m\leq n$ such that each of the integers\[m+1,\ldots,m+k\]are divisible by at least one prime $>k$. Estimate $k(n)$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er65} wrote it is 'not hard to prove' that\[k(n)\gg_\epsilon \exp((\log n)^{1/2-\epsilon})\]and it 'seems likely' that $k(n)=o(n^\epsilon)$, but had no non-trivial upper bound for $k(n)$.
  
  It is not clear...
