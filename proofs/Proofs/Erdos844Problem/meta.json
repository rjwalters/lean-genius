  "overview": "Let A ⊆ {1,...,N} be such that for all a,b ∈ A, the product ab is not squarefree. Is the maximum size of such an A achieved by taking A to be the set of even numbers and odd non-squarefree numbers? The answer is YES, proved independently by Weisenberg and by Alexeev-Mixon-Sawin.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - The maximum is achieved exactly by even numbers ∪ odd non-squarefree numbers. The key insight is reduction to Chvátal's result on intersecting families: among squarefree numbers, we need all pairs to share a prime, and this is maximized by taking all even squarefree numbers.",
