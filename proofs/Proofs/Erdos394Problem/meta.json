  "overview": "Let t_k(n) denote the least m such that n | m(m+1)(m+2)···(m+k-1). Is Σ_{n≤x} t₂(n) ≪ x²/(log x)^c for some c > 0? For k ≥ 2, is Σ_{n≤x} t_{k+1}(n) = o(Σ_{n≤x} t_k(n))?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "PARTIALLY SOLVED: Erdős-Hall (1978) proved Σ t₂(n) ≪ (log log log x / log log x) x². OPEN: The stronger conjecture Σ t₂(n) ≪ x²/(log x)^c for c < log 2 remains unproved. The hierarchy conjecture (Question 2) is also open. Special cases: t_{n-1}(n!) = 2, t_{n-2}(n!) ≪ n.",
