  For $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ let $G(A)$ be the graph with vertex set $A$, where two integers are joined by an edge if they are coprime.
  
  Is it true that if\[\lvert A\rvert >\lfloor\tfrac{n}{2}\rfloor+\lfloor\tfrac{n}{3}\rfloor-\lfloor\tfrac{n}{6}\rfloor\]then $G(A)$ contains all odd cycles of length $\leq \frac{n}{3}+1$?
  
  Is it true that, for every $\ell\geq 1$, if $n$ is sufficiently large ...
