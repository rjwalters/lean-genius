  Let $f(n)$ count the number of sum-free $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$, i.e. $A$ contains no solutions to $a=b+c$ with $a,b,c\in A$. Is it true that\[f(n)=2^{(1+o(1))\frac{n}{2}}?\]
  
  
  
  The Cameron-Erd\H{os conjecture}. It is trivial to see that $f(n) \geq 2^{\frac{n}{2}}$, considering all subsets of $[n/2,n]$.
  
  This is true, and in fact $f(n) \ll 2^{n/2}$, which was proved independently by Gre...
