  Let $f(n,k)$ count the number of self-avoiding walks of $n$ steps (beginning at the origin) in $\mathbb{Z}^k$ (i.e. those walks which do not intersect themselves). Determine\[C_k=\lim_{n\to\infty}f(n,k)^{1/n}.\]
  
  
  
  The constant $C_k$ is sometimes known as the connective constant. Hammersley and Morton \cite{HM54} showed that this limit exists, and it is trivial that $k\leq C_k\leq 2k-1$.
