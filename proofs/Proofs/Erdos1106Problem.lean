  Let $p(n)$ denote the partition function of $n$ and let $F(n)$ count the number of distinct prime factors of\[\prod_{1\leq k\leq n}p(k).\]Does $F(n)\to \infty$ with $n$? Is $F(n)>n$ for all sufficiently large $n$?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s at Oberwolfach in 1986. Schinzel noted in the Oberwolfach problem book that $F(n)\to \infty$ follows from the asymptotic formula for $p(n)$ and a result of Tijde...
