  Let $C>0$ be arbitrary. Is it true that, if $n$ is sufficiently large depending on $C$, then in any $2$-colouring of $\binom{\{2,\ldots,n\}}{2}$ there exists some $X\subset \{2,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\binom{X}{2}$ is monochromatic and\[\sum_{x\in X}\frac{1}{\log x}\geq C?\]
  
  
  
  The answer is yes, which was proved by R\"{o}dl \cite{Ro03}.
  
  In the same article R\"{o}dl also proved a lower boun...
