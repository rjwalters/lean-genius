  "overview": "Let t(n) be the maximal value such that n! = a₁·a₂·...·aₙ with t(n) = a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ ... ≤ aₙ. Is lim t(n)/n = 1/e? Does t(n)/n ≤ 1/e - c/log(n) for infinitely many n?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED: ACRSTUV (2025) proved t(n)/n = 1/e - c₀/log(n) + O(1/(log n)^{1+c}) where c₀ ≈ 0.3044. This answers both questions: (1) lim t(n)/n = 1/e, (2) the correction term holds for ALL large n. Explicit bounds: t(n) ≤ n/e for n ≠ 1,2,4 and t(n) ≥ n/3 for n ≥ 43632 (sharp). Historical note: Erdős-Selfridge-Straus claimed this but the proof was lost when Straus died.",
