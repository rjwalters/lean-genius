  Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$. Must there exist an edge $e$ such that, for all large $n$, $G$ contains a cycle of length $n$ containing $e$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Shelah \cite{EHS74}, who proved that $G$ must contain all sufficiently large cycles (see [594]).
  
  This is true, and was proved by Thomassen \cite{Th83}.
