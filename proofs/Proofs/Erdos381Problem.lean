  A number $n$ is highly composite if $\tau(m)<\tau(n)$ for all $m<n$, where $\tau(m)$ counts the number of divisors of $m$. Let $Q(x)$ count the number of highly composite numbers in $[1,x]$.
  
  Is it true that\[Q(x)\gg_k (\log x)^k\]for every $k\geq 1$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er44} proved $Q(x)\gg (\log x)^{1+c}$ for some constant $c>0$.
  
  The answer to this problem is no: Nicolas \cite{Ni71} ...
