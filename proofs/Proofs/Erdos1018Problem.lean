  Let $\epsilon>0$. Is there a constant $C_\epsilon$ such that, for all large $n$, every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $n^{1+\epsilon}$ edges must contain a subgraph on at most $C_\epsilon$ vertices which is non-planar?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er71} writes it is 'not difficult to see' that $C_\epsilon\to \infty$ as $\epsilon\to 0$.
