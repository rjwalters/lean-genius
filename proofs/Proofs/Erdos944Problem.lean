  A critical vertex, edge, or set of edges, is one whose deletion lowers the chromatic number.
  
  Let $k\geq 4$ and $r\geq 1$. Must there exist a graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ such that every vertex is critical, yet every critical set of edges has size $>r$?
  
  
  
  A graph $G$ with chromatic number $k$ in which every vertex is critical is called $k$-vertex-critical.
  
  This was conjectured ...
