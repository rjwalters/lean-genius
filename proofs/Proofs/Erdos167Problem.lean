  If $G$ is a graph with at most $k$ edge disjoint triangles then can $G$ be made triangle-free after removing at most $2k$ edges?
  
  
  
  A problem of Tuza. It is trivial that $G$ can be made triangle-free after removing at most $3k$ edges. The examples of $K_4$ and $K_5$ show that $2k$ would be best possible.
  
  The trivial bound of $\leq 3k$ was improved to $\leq (3-\frac{3}{23}+o(1))k$ by Haxell...
