  Let $k\geq 4$. Is it true that\[\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k) \ll_k n^{3/2},\]where $H_k$ is the graph on vertices $x,y_1,\ldots,y_k,z_1,\ldots,z_{\binom{k}{2}}$, where $x$ is adjacent to all $y_i$ and each pair of $y_i,y_j$ is adjacent to a unique $z_i$.
  
  
  
  It is trivial that $\mathrm{ex}(n;H_k)\gg n^{3/2}$ since $H_k$ contians a $C_4$ for $k\geq 3$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er71} claimed a proof for $k=3$.
