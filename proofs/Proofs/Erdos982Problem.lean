  If $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon then some vertex has at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ different distances to other vertices.
  
  
  
  The regular polygon shows that $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ is the best possible here.
  
  This would be implied if there was a vertex such that no three vertices of the polygon are equally distant to it, which was originally also conjectur...
