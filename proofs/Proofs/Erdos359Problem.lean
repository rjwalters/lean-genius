  Let $a_1<a_2<\cdots$ be an infinite sequence of integers such that $a_1=n$ and $a_{i+1}$ is the least integer which is not a sum of consecutive earlier $a_j$s. What can be said about the density of this sequence?
  
  In particular, in the case $n=1$, can one prove that $a_k/k\to \infty$ and $a_k/k^{1+c}\to 0$ for any $c>0$?
