  Describe the size of the second largest component of the random graph on $n$ vertices, where each edge is included independently with probability $1/n$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s believed that almost surely the second largest component has size $\ll \log n$. This is true, as proved by Koml\'{o}s, Sulyok, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{KSS80}.
