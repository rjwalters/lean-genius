  Statement:
  Let $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ be such that every large integer can be written as $n^2+a$ for some $a\in A$ and $n\geq 0$. What is the smallest possible value of\[\limsup \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}?\]Is\[\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}>1?\] Such a set $A$ is called an additive complement of the set of squares. Erdős observed that there exist $A$ for which the $\limsup$ is finite and $>1$. Moser [Mo65] proved that, for any such $A$,\[\liminf \frac{\lver...
