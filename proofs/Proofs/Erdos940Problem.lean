  Let $r\geq 3$. A number $n$ is $r$-powerful if for every prime $p$ which divides $n$ we have $p^r\mid n$.
  
  Are there infinitely many integers which are not the sum of at most $r$ many $r$-powerful numbers? Does the set of integers which are the sum of at most $r$ $r$-powerful numbers have density $0$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er76d} claims that the claim that the set has density $0$ is 'easy' for...
