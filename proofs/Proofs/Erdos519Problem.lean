  Let $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in \mathbb{C}$ with $z_1=1$. Must there exist an absolute constant $c>0$ such that\[\max_{1\leq k\leq n}\left\lvert \sum_{i}z_i^k\right\rvert>c?\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Tur\'{a}n, who proved that this maximum is $\gg 1/n$. This was solved by Atkinson \cite{At61b}, who showed that $c=1/6$ suffices. This has been improved by Bir\'{o}, first to $c=1/2$ \cite{Bi94}, and later to an ab...
