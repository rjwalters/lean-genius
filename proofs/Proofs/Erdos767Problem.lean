  Let $g_k(n)$ be the maximal number of edges possible on a graph with $n$ vertices which does not contain a cycle with $k$ chords incident to a vertex on the cycle. Is it true that\[g_k(n)=(k+1)n-(k+1)^2\]for $n$ sufficiently large?
  
  
  
  Czipszer proved that $g_k(n)$ exists for all $k$, and in fact $g_k(n)\leq (k+1)n$. Erd\H{o}s wrote it is 'easy to see' that\[g_k(n)\geq (k+1)n-(k+1)^2.\]P\'{o}sa ...
