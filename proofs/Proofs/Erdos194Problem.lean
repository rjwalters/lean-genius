  Let $k\geq 3$. Must any ordering of $\mathbb{R}$ contain a monotone $k$-term arithmetic progression, that is, some $x_1<\cdots<x_k$ which forms an increasing or decreasing $k$-term arithmetic progression?
  
  
  
  The answer is no, even for $k=3$, as shown by Ardal, Brown, and Jungi\'{c} \cite{ABJ11}.
  
  See also [195] and [196].
