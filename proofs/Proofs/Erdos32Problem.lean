  Statement:
  Is there a set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that\[\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert = o((\log N)^2)\]and such that every large integer can be written as $p+a$ for some prime $p$ and $a\in A$? Can the bound $O(\log N)$ be achieved? Must such an $A$ satisfy\[\liminf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{\log N}> 1?\]
