  Let $m=m(n,k)$ be minimal such that in any collection of sets $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ there must exist a sunflower of size $k$ - that is, some collection of $k$ of the $A_i$ which pairwise have the same intersection.
  
  Estimate $m(n,k)$, or even better, give an asymptotic formula.
  
  
  
  Related to [536] and [856]. In \cite{Er70} Erd\H{o}s asks this in the equivalent formulation...
