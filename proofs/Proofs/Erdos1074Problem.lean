  Let $S$ be the set of all $m\geq 1$ such that there exists a prime $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such that $m!+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$. Does\[\lim \frac{\lvert S\cap [1,x]\rvert}{x}\]exist? What is it?
  
  Similarly, if $P$ is the set of all primes $p$ such that there exists an $m$ with $p\not\equiv 1\pmod{m}$ such that $m!+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$, then does\[\lim \frac{\lvert P\cap [1,x]\rvert}{\pi(x)}\]exist? What ...
