  Let $g(k)>k+1$ be the smallest $n$ such that all prime factors of $\binom{n}{k}$ are $>k$. Estimate $g(k)$.
  
  
  
  A question of Ecklund, Erd\H{o}s, and Selfridge \cite{EES74}, who proved\[k^{1+c}<g(k)\leq \exp((1+o(1))k)\]for some constant $c>0$, and conjectured $g(k)<L_k=[1,\ldots,k]$, the least common multiple of all integers $\leq k$, for all large $k$. In \cite{EES74} they further conjecture t...
