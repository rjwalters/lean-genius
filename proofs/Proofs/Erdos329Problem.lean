  Suppose $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is a Sidon set. How large can\[\limsup_{N\to \infty}\frac{\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}\]be?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s proved that $1/2$ is possible and Kr\"{u}ckeberg \cite{Kr61} proved $1/\sqrt{2}$ is possible. Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n \cite{ErTu41} have proved this $\limsup$ is always $\leq 1$.
  
  The fact that $1$ is possible would follow if any finite Sido...
