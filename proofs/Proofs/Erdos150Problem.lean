  A minimal cut of a graph is a minimal set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. Let $c(n)$ be the maximum number of minimal cuts a graph on $n$ vertices can have.
  
  Does $c(n)^{1/n}\to \alpha$ for some $\alpha <2$?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, who also ask whether $c(3m+2)=3^m$. Seymour observed that $c(3m+2)\geq 3^m$, as seen by the graph of $m$ independent paths o...
