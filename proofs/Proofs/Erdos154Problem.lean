  Let $A\subset \{1,\ldots,N\}$ be a Sidon set with $\lvert A\rvert\sim N^{1/2}$. Must $A+A$ be well-distributed over all small moduli? In particular, must about half the elements of $A+A$ be even and half odd?
  
  
  
  Lindstr\"{o}m \cite{Li98} has shown this is true for $A$ itself, subsequently strengthened by Kolountzakis \cite{Ko99}. It follows immediately using the Sidon property that $A+A$ is sim...
