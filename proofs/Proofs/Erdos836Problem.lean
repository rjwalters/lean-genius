  Let $r\geq 2$ and $G$ be a $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $3$ (that is, there is a $3$-colouring of the vertices of $G$ such that no edge is monochromatic).
  
  Suppose any two edges of $G$ have a non-empty intersection. Must $G$ contain $O(r^2)$ many vertices? Must there be two edges which meet in $\gg r$ many vertices?
