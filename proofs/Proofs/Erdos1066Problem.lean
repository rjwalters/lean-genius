  Let $G$ be a graph given by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where any two distinct points are at least distance $1$ apart, and we draw an edge between two points if they are distance $1$ apart.
  
  Let $g(n)$ be maximal such that any such graph always has an independent set on at least $g(n)$ vertices. Estimate $g(n)$, or perhaps $\lim \frac{g(n)}{n}$.
  
  
  
  Such graphs are always planar. Erd\H{o}s...
