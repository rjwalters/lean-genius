  Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $\delta n^{2}$ edges. Are there subgraphs $H_1,H_2\subseteq G$ such that
  {UL}
  {LI}$H_1$ has $\gg \delta^3n^2$ edges and every two edges in $H_1$ are contained in a cycle of length at most $6$, and furthermore if two edges share a vertex they are on a cycle of length $4$, and
  {LI}$H_2$ has $\gg \delta^2n^2$ edges and every two edges in $H_2$ are contained i...
