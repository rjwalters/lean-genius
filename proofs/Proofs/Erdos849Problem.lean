  Is it true that, for every integer $t\geq 1$, there is some integer $a$ such that\[\binom{n}{k}=a\](with $1\leq k\leq n/2$) has exactly $t$ solutions?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er96b} credits this to himself and Gordon 'many years ago', but it is more commonly known as Singmaster's conjecture. For $t=3$ one could take $a=120$, and for $t=4$ one could take $a=3003$. There are no known examples for $t\g...
