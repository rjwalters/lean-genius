  Find, for all large $n$, a non-trivial pairwise balanced block design $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that, for all $t$, there are $O(n^{1/2})$ many $i$ such that $\lvert A_i\rvert=t$.
  
  
  
  $A_1,\ldots,A_m$ is a pairwise balanced block design if every pair in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one of the $A_i$.
