  Let $(S_n)_{n\geq 1}$ be a sequence of sets of complex numbers, none of which have a finite limit point. Does there exist an entire transcendental function $f(z)$ such that, for all $n\geq 1$, there exists some $k_n\geq 0$ such that\[f^{(k_n)}(z) = 0\textrm{ for all }z\in S_n?\]
  
  
  
  This is Problem 2.30 in \cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s.
