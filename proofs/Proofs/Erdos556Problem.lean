  Let $R(G;3)$ denote the minimal $m$ such that if the edges of $K_m$ are $3$-coloured then there must be a monochromatic copy of $G$. Show that\[R(C_n;3) \leq 4n-3.\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Bondy and Erd\H{o}s. This inequality is best possible for odd $n$.
  
  Luczak \cite{Lu99} has shown that $R(C_n;3)\leq (4+o(1))n$ for all $n$, and in fact $R(C_n;3)\leq 3n+o(n)$ for even $n$.
