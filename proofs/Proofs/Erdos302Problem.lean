  Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that there are no solutions to\[\frac{1}{a}= \frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\]with distinct $a,b,c\in A$?
  
  Estimate $f(N)$. In particular, is $f(N)=(\tfrac{1}{2}+o(1))N$?
  
  
  
  
  The colouring version of this is [303], which was solved by Brown and R\"{o}dl \cite{BrRo91}. One can take either $A$ to be all odd integers in $[1,N]$ o...
