  Show that, for any $n\geq 5$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{2n}{n}$ is not squarefree.
  
  
  
  It is easy to see that $4\mid \binom{2n}{n}$ except when $n=2^k$, and hence it suffices to prove this when $n$ is a power of $2$.
  
  Proved by S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy \cite{Sa85} for all sufficiently large $n$, and by Granville and Ramar\'{e} \cite{GrRa96} for all $n\geq 5$.
  
  More generally, if $f(n)$ is ...
