  For which functions $g(n)$ with $n>g(n)\geq (\log n)^2$ is there a graph on $n$ vertices in which every induced subgraph on $g(n)$ vertices contains a clique of size $\geq \log n$ and an independent set of size $\geq \log n$?
  
  In particular, is there such a graph for $g(n)=(\log n)^3$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal, who thought that there is no such graph for $g(n)=(\log n)^3$. Alon ...
