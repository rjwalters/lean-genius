  Let $k\geq 3$. Are there $k$ consecutive primes in arithmetic progression?
  
  
  
  Green and Tao \cite{GrTa08} have proved that there must always exist some $k$ primes in arithmetic progression, but these need not be consecutive. Erd\H{o}s called this conjecture 'completely hopeless at present'.
  
  The existence of such progressions for small $k$ has been verified for $k\leq 10$, see the Wikipedia...
