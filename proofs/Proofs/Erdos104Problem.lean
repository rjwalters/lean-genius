  Given $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ the number of distinct unit circles containing at least three points is $o(n^2)$.
  
  
  
  In \cite{Er81d} Erd\H{o}s proved that $\gg n$ many circles is possible, and that there cannot be more than $O(n^2)$ many circles. The argument is very simple: every pair of points determines at most $2$ unit circles, and the claimed bound follows from double counting. Erd\H{o}...
