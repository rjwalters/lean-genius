# Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

## What This Proves
We prove both parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
- Part 1: d/dx ∫ₐˣ f(t)dt = f(x) (differentiation undoes integration)
- Part 2: ∫ₐᵇ f'(x)dx = f(b) - f(a) (integration undoes differentiation)

## Approach
- **Foundation (from Mathlib):** We use Mathlib's measure theory and calculus
  libraries. The core theorems `integral_hasDerivAt_right` and
  `integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt` are from Mathlib.
- **Original Contributions:** This file provides pedagogical organization,
  wrapper theorems with cleaner hypotheses (like `ftc_part1_continuous`),
  and extensive commentary explaining the theorem's significance.
- **Proof Techniques Demonstrated:** Working with Mathlib's measure theory API,
  continuity and integrability conditions, interval integrals.

## Status
- [x] Complete proof
- [ ] Uses Mathlib for main result
- [ ] Proves extensions/corollaries
- [ ] Pedagogical example
- [ ] Incomplete (has sorries)

## Mathlib Dependencies
- `integral_hasDerivAt_right` : FTC Part 1 (derivative of integral)
- `integral_eq_sub_of_hasDerivAt` : FTC Part 2 (integral of derivative)
- `IntervalIntegrable` : Integrability on intervals
- `HasDerivAt` : Derivative at a point
- `ContinuousAt`, `Continuous` : Continuity definitions

Historical Note: Newton and Leibniz discovered calculus independently in the
late 17th century, but rigorous formulation required Cauchy (1820s) and
Weierstrass (1860s).

  Part 1: The Derivative of an Integral

  If f is continuous on [a, b], and we define F(x) = ∫ₐˣ f(t) dt,
  then F is differentiable and F'(x) = f(x).

  This says: integration is the "inverse" of differentiation.

  Part 2: The Integral of a Derivative

  If F is differentiable on [a, b] with continuous derivative f = F',
  then ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a).

  This is the evaluation theorem: to compute a definite integral,
  find an antiderivative and evaluate at the endpoints.

  The Unity of Calculus

  Together, FTC Parts 1 and 2 establish that differentiation and integration
  are inverse operations (up to constants):

  - If you integrate then differentiate, you get back the original: d/dx ∫ₐˣ f = f
  - If you differentiate then integrate, you get back (up to constant): ∫ₐˣ F' = F - F(a)

  This is why we call F an "antiderivative" of f when F' = f.
