  Let $C>1$. Does the set of integers of the form $p+\lfloor C^k\rfloor$, for some prime $p$ and $k\geq 0$, have density $>0$?
  
  
  
  Originally asked to Erd\H{o}s by Kalm\'{a}r. Erd\H{o}s believed the answer is yes. Romanoff \cite{Ro34} proved that the answer is yes if $C$ is an integer.
  
  Ding \cite{Di25} has proved that this is true for almost all $C>1$.
