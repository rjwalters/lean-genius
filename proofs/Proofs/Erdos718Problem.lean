  Is there some constant $C>0$ such that any graph on $n$ vertices with $\geq Cr^2n$ edges contains a subdivision of $K_r$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Mader. Dirac \cite{Di60} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices with at least $2n-2$ edges contains a subdivision of $K_4$, and conjectured that $3n-5$ edges forces a subdivision of $K_5$.
  
  Mader \cite{Ma67} proved that $\geq 2^...
