  If there is a finite projective plane of order $n$ then must $n$ be a prime power?
  
  A finite projective plane of order $n$ is a collection of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n^2+n+1\}$ of size $n+1$ such that every pair of elements is contained in exactly one set.
  
  
  
  These always exist if $n$ is a prime power. This conjecture has been proved for $n\leq 11$, but it is open whether there exists a proj...
