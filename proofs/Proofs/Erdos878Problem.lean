  If $n=\prod_{1\leq i\leq t} p_i^{k_i}$ is the factorisation of $n$ into distinct primes then let\[f(n)=\sum p_i^{\ell_i},\]where $\ell_i$ is chosen such that $n\in [p_i^{\ell_i},p_i^{\ell_i+1})$. Furthermore, let\[F(n)=\max \sum_{i=1}^t a_i\]where the maximum is taken over all $a_1,\ldots,a_t\leq n$ such that $(a_i,a_j)=1$ for $i\neq j$ and all prime factors of each $a_i$ are prime factors of $n$.
