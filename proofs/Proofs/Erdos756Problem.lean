  Let $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points. Can there be $\gg n$ many distinct distances each of which occurs for more than $n$ many pairs from $A$?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Pach in the stronger form of whether all distances (aside from the largest) can occur with multiplicity $>n$. Hopf and Pannowitz \cite{HoPa34} proved that the largest distance between points of $A$ can occur at mos...
