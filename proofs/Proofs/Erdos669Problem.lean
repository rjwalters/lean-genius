  Let $F_k(n)$ be minimal such that for any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ there exist at most $F_k(n)$ many distinct lines passing through at least $k$ of the points, and $f_k(n)$ similarly but with lines passing through exactly $k$ points.
  
  Estimate $f_k(n)$ and $F_k(n)$ - in particular, determine $\lim F_k(n)/n^2$ and $\lim f_k(n)/n^2$.
  
  
  
  Trivially $f_k(n)\leq F_k(n)$ and $f_2(n)=F_2(n)=\bi...
