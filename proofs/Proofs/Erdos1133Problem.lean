  Let $C>0$. There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large the following holds.
  
  For any $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in [-1,1]$ there exist $y_1,\ldots,y_n\in [-1,1]$ such that, if $P$ is a polynomial of degree $m<(1+\epsilon)n$ with $P(x_i)=y_i$ for at least $(1-\epsilon)n$ many $1\leq i\leq n$, then\[\max_{x\in [-1,1]}\lvert P(x)\rvert >C.\]
