  For any $n$, let $A(n)=\{0<n<\cdots\}$ be the infinite sequence with $a_0=0$ and $a_1=n$, and for $k\geq 1$ we define $a_{k+1}$ as the least integer such that there is no three-term arithmetic progression in $\{a_0,\ldots,a_{k+1}\}$.
  
  Can the $a_k$ be explicitly determined? How fast do they grow?
  
  
  
  It is easy to see that $A(1)$ is the set of integers which have no 2 in their base 3 expansi...
