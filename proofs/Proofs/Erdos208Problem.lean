  Let $s_1<s_2<\cdots$ be the sequence of squarefree numbers. Is it true that, for any $\epsilon>0$ and large $n$,\[s_{n+1}-s_n \ll_\epsilon s_n^{\epsilon}?\]Is it true that\[s_{n+1}-s_n \leq (1+o(1))\frac{\pi^2}{6}\frac{\log s_n}{\log\log s_n}?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er51} showed that there are infinitely many $n$ such that\[s_{n+1}-s_n > (1+o(1))\frac{\pi^2}{6}\frac{\log s_n}{\log\log s_n},\]so t...
