  Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest Sidon subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ and $A(N)$ be the number of Sidon subsets of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$. Is it true that\[A(N)/2^{f(N)}\to \infty?\]Is it true that\[A(N) = 2^{(1+o(1))f(N)}?\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Cameron and Erd\H{o}s. It is known that $f(N)\sim N^{1/2}$ and conjectured (see [30]) that $f(N)=N^{1/2}+O(N^{\epsilon})$.
  
  While $A(N)$ has not been comple...
