  Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$. Is there, for every cardinal number $m$, some graph $G_m$ of chromatic number $m$ such that every finite subgraph of $G_m$ is a subgraph of $G$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Walter Taylor. The more general problem replaces $\aleph_1$ with any uncountable cardinal $\kappa$.
  
  More generally, Erd\H{o}s asks to characterise families $\mathcal{F}_\alpha...
