  Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contains at most $f(n)$ many sets of four points which are 'degenerate' in the sense that some pair are the same distance apart. Estimate $f(n)$ - in particular, is it true that $f(n)\leq n^{3+o(1)}$?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and Purdy \cite{ErPu71}, who proved\[n^3\log n \ll f(n) \ll n^{7/2}.\]
