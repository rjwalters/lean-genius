  Let $p:\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{Z}$ be a polynomial whose leading coefficient is positive and such that there exists no $d\geq 2$ with $d\mid p(n)$ for all $n\geq 1$. Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $m$, there exist integers $1\leq n_1<\cdots <n_k$ such that\[1=\frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k}\]and\[m=p(n_1)+\cdots+p(n_k)?\]
  
  
  
  Graham \cite{Gr63} has proved this when $p(x)=x$. Graham...
