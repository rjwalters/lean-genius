  Let $V(x)$ count the number of $n\leq x$ such that $\phi(m)=n$ is solvable. Does $V(2x)/V(x)\to 2$? Is there an asymptotic formula for $V(x)$?
  
  
  
  Pillai \cite{Pi29} proved $V(x)=o(x)$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er35b} proved $V(x)=x(\log x)^{-1+o(1)}$.
  
  The behaviour of $V(x)$ is now almost completely understood. Maier and Pomerance \cite{MaPo88} proved\[V(x)=\frac{x}{\log x}e^{(C+o(1))(\log\log\log ...
