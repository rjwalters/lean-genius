  Erdős Problem #416: Counting Totient Values

  Let V(x) count the number of n ≤ x such that φ(m) = n is solvable
  (i.e., n is in the range of Euler's totient function).

  **Questions**:
  (i)  Does V(2x)/V(x) → 2 as x → ∞?
  (ii) Is there an asymptotic formula for V(x)?

  **Status**: OPEN (main questions), but asymptotic bounds are well-understood

  **History**:
  - Pillai (1929): V(x) = o(x)
  - Erdős (1935): V(x) = x(log x)^(-1+o(1))
  - Maier-Pomerance (1988): V(x) = (x/log x) · e^((C+o(1))(log log log x)²)
  - Ford (1998): V(x) ≍ (x/log x) · e^(C₁(log log log x - log log log log x)² + ...)

  The problem asks whether these bounds can be refined to an actual asymptotic
  formula, and whether the doubling ratio V(2x)/V(x) tends to 2.

/- ## The Counting Function V(x) -/

/--
**V(x)** counts the number of positive integers n ≤ x that are **totient values**,
meaning there exists some m with φ(m) = n.

Not every positive integer is a totient value:
- φ(1) = 1, φ(2) = 1, so 1 is a totient value
- φ(3) = 2, so 2 is a totient value
- No m has φ(m) = 3 (since φ(m) is even for m > 2), so 3 is NOT a totient value

The function V(x) counts how many n ≤ x ARE totient values.

/- ## Partial Results (Solved) -/

/--
**Pillai (1929)**: V(x) = o(x)

The density of totient values is 0. Most integers are NOT totient values.
This was the first quantitative result about the sparsity of totient values.
-/
/--
**Erdős (1935)**: V(x) = x · (log x)^(-1+o(1))

This refines Pillai's result: V(x) behaves like x/log x up to sub-polynomial
factors in the exponent. The density decays like 1/log x.
-/
/--
**Maier-Pomerance (1988)**: V(x) = (x/log x) · e^((C+o(1))(log log log x)²)

A more precise asymptotic: the correction factor is exponential in (log log log x)².
The constant C is explicitly computable.
-/
/--
**Ford (1998)**: The most precise bound known

V(x) ≍ (x/log x) · exp(C₁(log log log x - log log log log x)² + C₂ log log log x - C₃ log log log log x)

This determines V(x) up to constant factors but still falls short of an asymptotic formula.
-/
/- ## Main Open Questions -/

/--
**Erdős Problem #416, Part (i)**: Does V(2x)/V(x) → 2?

This asks whether doubling the range roughly doubles the count of totient values.
If V(x) ~ c · x / log x for some constant c, this would follow.
But the complicated structure of Ford's bound makes this uncertain.

/--
**Erdős Problem #416, Part (ii)**: Is there an asymptotic formula for V(x)?

This asks for V(x) ~ f(x) for some explicit function f, not just V(x) ≍ f(x).
Ford's result gives tight bounds but not an asymptotic.

/- ## The Main Conjecture -/

/--
**Erdős Problem #416**: Both questions remain OPEN.

Despite Ford's remarkable work determining V(x) up to constant factors,
neither the doubling ratio nor an asymptotic formula has been established.

/-- 3 is NOT a totient value (no m has φ(m) = 3).
    Proof: φ(m) is even for m > 2, and φ(1) = φ(2) = 1. -/
