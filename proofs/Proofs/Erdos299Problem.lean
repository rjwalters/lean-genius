  Is there an infinite sequence $a_1<a_2<\cdots $ such that $a_{i+1}-a_i=O(1)$ and no finite sum of $\frac{1}{a_i}$ is equal to $1$?
  
  
  
  There does not exist such a sequence, which follows from the positive solution to [298] by Bloom \cite{Bl21}.
  
  This problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.
