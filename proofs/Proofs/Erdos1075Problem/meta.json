  "overview": "For r ≥ 3, does there exist c_r > r^{-r} such that any r-uniform hypergraph on n vertices with at least (1+ε)(n/r)^r edges contains a subgraph on m vertices with at least c_r·m^r edges, where m → ∞ as n → ∞? Erdős proved this holds with c_r = r^{-r}.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - The question is whether the density constant c_r can be improved beyond r^{-r}. The weaker edge threshold (1+ε)(n/r)^r vs ε·n^r may allow stronger conclusions. No improvement is currently known.",
