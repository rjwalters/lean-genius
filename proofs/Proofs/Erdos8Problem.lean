  Statement:
  For any finite colouring of the integers is there a covering system all of whose moduli are monochromatic? Conjectured by Erdős and Graham, who also ask about a density-type version: for example, is\[\sum_{\substack{a\in A\\ a>N}}\frac{1}{a}\gg \log N\]a sufficient condition for $A$ to contain the moduli of a covering system? The answer (to both colouring and density versions) is no, due to the result of Hough [Ho15] on the minimum size of a modulus in a covering system - in particular one co...
