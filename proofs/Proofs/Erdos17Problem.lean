  Erdős Problem #17

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/17
  Status: SOLVED
  Prize: $97

  Statement:
  Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that every even number $n\leq p-3$ can be written as a difference of primes $n=q_1-q_2$ where $q_1,q_2\leq p$? The first prime without this property is $97$. The sequence of such primes is A038133 in the OEIS. These are called cluster primes. Blecksmith, Erdős, and Selfridge [BES99] proved that the number of such primes is\[\ll_A \frac{x}{(\log x)^A}\]for every $A>0$, and Elsholtz [El03] improved this to\[\ll x\exp(-c(\log\log x)^2)\]for every $c View...
