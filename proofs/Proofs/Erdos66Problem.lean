  Is there $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that\[\lim_{n\to \infty}\frac{1_A\ast 1_A(n)}{\log n}\]exists and is $\neq 0$?
  
  
  
  A suitably constructed random set has this property if we are allowed to ignore an exceptional set of density zero. The challenge is obtaining this with no exceptional set. Erd\H{o}s believed the answer should be no. Erd\H{o}s and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy proved that\[\frac{\lvert 1_A\...
