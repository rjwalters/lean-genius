  Let $Q(x)$ count the number of squarefree integers in $[1,x]$. Determine the order of magnitude in the error term in the asymptotic\[Q(x)=\frac{6}{\pi^2}x+E(x).\]
  
  
  
  It is elementary to prove $E(x)\ll x^{1/2}$, and the prime number theorem implies $o(x^{1/2})$. The best known unconditional upper bound is of the shape $x^{1/2-o(1)}$, due to Walfisz \cite{Wa63}. Evelyn and Linfoot \cite{EvLi31} p...
