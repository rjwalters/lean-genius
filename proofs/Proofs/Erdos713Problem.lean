  Is it true that, for every bipartite graph $G$, there exists some $\alpha\in [1,2)$ and $c>0$ such that\[\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\sim cn^\alpha?\]Must $\alpha$ be rational?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits. Erd\H{o}s sometimes asked this in the weaker version with just\[\mathrm{ex}(n;G)\asymp n^{\alpha}.\]Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er67d} had initially conjectured that, for any bipartite graph $G$, $\math...
