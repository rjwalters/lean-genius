  Let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$. Is it true that\[f(n) \gg n^{1/2}?\]
  
  
  
  Euler conjectured that $f(n)=1$ when $n\equiv 2\pmod{4}$, but this was disproved by Bose, Parker, and Shrikhande \cite{BPS60} who proved $f(n)\geq 2$ for $n\geq 7$.
  
  Chowla, Erd\H{o}s, and Straus \cite{CES60} proved $f(n) \gg n^{1/91}$. Wilson \cite{Wi74} proved $f(n) ...
