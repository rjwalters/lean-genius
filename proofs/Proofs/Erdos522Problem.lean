  Let $f(z)=\sum_{0\leq k\leq n} \epsilon_k z^k$ be a random polynomial, where $\epsilon_k\in \{-1,1\}$ independently uniformly at random for $0\leq k\leq n$.
  
  Is it true that, if $R_n$ is the number of roots of $f(z)$ in $\{ z\in \mathbb{C} : \lvert z\rvert \leq 1\}$, then\[\frac{R_n}{n/2}\to 1\]almost surely?
  
  
  
  Random polynomials with independently identically distributed coefficients are ...
