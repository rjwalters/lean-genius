  Let $g(n)$ be minimal such that there exists $A\subseteq \{0,\ldots,n\}$ of size $g(n)$ with $\{0,\ldots,n\}\subseteq A+A$. Estimate $g(n)$. In particular is it true that $g(n)\sim 2n^{1/2}$?
  
  
  
  Such a set is often called a finite additive $2$-basis. A problem of Rohrbach, who proved in \cite{Ro37}\[(2+c)n \leq g(n)^2 \leq 4n\]for some small constant $c>0$. The current best-known bounds are\[(2...
