  Let $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ be a set with positive upper density. Must there exist an infinite set $B$ and integer $t$ such that\[B+B+t\subseteq A?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75b} posed this as a candidate for a density version of Hindman's theorem (see [172]).
  
  This is true, and was proved by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson \cite{KMRR24}.
  
  See also [109].
