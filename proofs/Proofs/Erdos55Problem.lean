  A set of integers $A$ is Ramsey $r$-complete if, whenever $A$ is $r$-coloured, all sufficiently large integers can be written as a monochromatic sum of elements of $A$. Prove any non-trivial bounds about the growth rate of such an $A$ for $r>2$.
  
  
  
  A paper of Burr and Erd\H{o}s \cite{BuEr85} proves both upper and lower bounds for $r=2$, showing that there exists some $c>0$ such that it cannot b...
