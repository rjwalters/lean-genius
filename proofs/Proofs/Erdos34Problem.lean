  Statement:
  For any permutation $\pi\in S_n$ of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ let $S(\pi)$ count the number of distinct consecutive sums, that is, sums of the shape $\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}\pi(i)$. Is it true that\[S(\pi) = o(n^2)\]for all $\pi\in S_n$? It is easy to see that $S(\iota)=o(n^2)$ if $\iota$ denotes the identity permutation. Motivated by this, Erdős asked if this remains true for all permutations. The first counterexample was provided by Hegyvári [He86], who constructed a permutation with $S(\pi) \geq (1/18...
