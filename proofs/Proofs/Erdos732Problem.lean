  Call a sequence $1< X_1\leq \cdots \leq X_m\leq n$ block-compatible if there is a pairwise balanced block design $A_1,\ldots,A_m\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\lvert A_i\rvert=X_i$ for $1\leq i\leq m$. (A pairwise block design means that every pair in $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one of the $A_i$.)
  
  Are there necessary and sufficient conditions for $(X_i)$ to be block-compatible?
