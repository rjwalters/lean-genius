  Does there exist a $3$-critical $3$-uniform hypergraph in which every vertex has degree $\geq 7$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'{a}sz.
  
  They do not specify what is meant by $3$-critical. One definition in the literature is: a hypergraph is $3$-critical if there is a set of $3$ vertices which intersects every edge, but no such set of size $2$, and yet for any edge $e$ there is a pair of...
