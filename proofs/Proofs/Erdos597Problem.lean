  Let $G$ be a graph on at most $\aleph_1$ vertices which contains no $K_4$ and no $K_{\aleph_0,\aleph_0}$ (the complete bipartite graph with $\aleph_0$ vertices in each class). Is it true that\[\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1\omega, G)^2?\]What about finite $G$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal proved that $\omega_1^2 \to (\omega_1\omega,3)^2$. Erd\H{o}s originally asked this with just the assumption that $G$ i...
