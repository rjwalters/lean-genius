  Let $G_n$ be the unit distance graph in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if the distance between them is $1$.
  
  Estimate the chromatic number $\chi(G_n)$. Does it grow exponentially in $n$? Does\[\lim_{n\to \infty}\chi(G_n)^{1/n}\]exist?
  
  
  
  A generalisation of the Hadwiger-Nelson problem (which addresses $n=2$). Frankl and Wilson \cite{FrWi81} proved exponentia...
