  Statement:
  Is every odd $n$ the sum of a squarefree number and a power of 2? Odlyzko has checked this up to $10^7$. Hercher [He24b] has verified this is true for all odd integers up to $2^{50}\approx 1.12\times 10^{15}$. Granville and Soundararajan [GrSo98] have proved that this is very related to the problem of finding Wieferich primes, which are $p$ for which $2^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod{p^2}$ - for example, if every odd integer is the sum of a squarefree number and a power of $2$ then a positive proportion ...
