  Let $R^*(G)$ be the induced Ramsey number: the minimal $m$ such that there is a graph $H$ on $m$ vertices such that any $2$-colouring of the edges of $H$ contains an induced monochromatic copy of $G$.
  
  Is it true that\[R^*(G) \leq 2^{O(n)}\]for any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and R\"{o}dl. Even the existence of $R^*(G)$ is not obvious, but was proved independently b...
