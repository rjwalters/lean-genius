  Suppose $A=\{w_1,\ldots,w_n\}\subset S^2$ maximises\[\prod_{i<j}\lvert w_i-w_j\rvert\]over all possible sets of size $n$.
  
  Is it true that\[\max_C\lvert \lvert A\cap C\rvert - \alpha_C n\rvert =o(n),\]where the maximum is taken over all spherical caps $C$ and $\alpha_C$ is the area of $C$ (normalised so that the entire sphere has area $1$)?
  
  
  
  This is certainly solved, although it is unclea...
