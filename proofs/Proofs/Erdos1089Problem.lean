  Let $g_d(n)$ be minimal such that every collection of $g_d(n)$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ determines at least $n$ many distinct distances. Estimate $g_d(n)$. In particular, does\[\lim_{d\to \infty}\frac{g_d(n)}{d^{n-1}}\]exist?
  
  
  
  A question of Kelly. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75f} writes it is 'easy' to see that $g_d(n)\gg d^{n-1}$. Erd\H{o}s and Straus proved (in unpublished work mentioned in \cite{Er7...
