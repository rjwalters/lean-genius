  "overview": "Let a₁,...,aᵣ,b₁,...,bᵣ ∈ ℕ with Σ(1/aᵢ) > 1. For sequence A, define T(A) = (aᵢxⱼ + bᵢ). Starting with A₁=(1) and iterating, prove some Aₖ has repeated elements. Klarner (1982) proved this by showing the density condition Σ(1/aᵢ) > 1 implies the affine semigroup is non-free, causing collisions.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "The conjecture is TRUE: when Σ(1/aᵢ) > 1, repeated elements must eventually appear. The key insight connects to semigroup theory: the affine semigroup is free iff Σ(1/aᵢ) ≤ 1. Non-freeness implies relations, which manifest as collisions in the sequence. Extended by Kolpakov-Talambutsa to more general settings.",
