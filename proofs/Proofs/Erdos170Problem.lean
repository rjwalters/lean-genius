  Let $F(N)$ be the smallest possible size of $A\subset \{0,1,\ldots,N\}$ such that $\{0,1,\ldots,N\}\subset A-A$. Find the value of\[\lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{F(N)}{N^{1/2}}.\]
  
  
  
  The Sparse Ruler problem. R\'{e}dei asked whether this limit exists, which was proved by Erd\H{o}s and G\'{a}l \cite{ErGa48}. Bounds on the limit were improved by Leech \cite{Le56}. The limit is known to be in the interv...
