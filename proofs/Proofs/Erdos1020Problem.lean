  Let $f(n;r,k)$ be the maximal number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph which contains no set of $k$ many independent edges.
  
  For all $r\geq 3$,\[f(n;r,k)=\max\left(\binom{rk-1}{r}, \binom{n}{r}-\binom{n-k+1}{r}\right).\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Gallai \cite{ErGa59} proved this is true when $r=2$ (when $r=2$ this also follows from the Erd\H{os-Ko-Rado theorem}).
