  Let $C>0$. Does there exist a $c>0$ (depending on $C$) such that, for all sufficiently large $x$, if $A\subseteq [1,x]$ has $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}\leq C$ then\[\#\{ m\leq x : a\nmid m\textrm{ for all }a\in A\}\gg\frac{x}{(\log x)^c}?\]
  
  
  
  An example of Schinzel and Szekeres \cite{ScSz59} shows that this would be best possible (up to the value of $c$).
  
  See also [542].
