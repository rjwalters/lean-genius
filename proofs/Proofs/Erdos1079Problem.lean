  Let $r\geq 4$. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\mathrm{ex}(n;K_r)$ edges then must $G$ contain a vertex with degree $d\gg_r n$ whose neighbourhood contains at least $\mathrm{ex}(d;K_{r-1})$ edges?
  
  
  
  As Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75} says 'if true this would be a nice generalisation of Tur\'{a}n's theorem'.
  
  This is true (unless $G$ it itself the Tur\'{a}n graph), and was proved by ...
