  "overview": "Let f(z) = ∏(z - zᵢ) ∈ ℂ[z] where |zᵢ| ≤ 1 for all i. Define Λ(f) as the maximum of the lengths of the boundaries of the connected components of {z : |f(z)| < 1}. The problem asks to determine the infimum of Λ(f) over all such polynomials.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "The infimum is 2. Tang proved this result and conjectured that for fixed degree n, the infimum is achieved by f_n(z) = z^n - 1 (roots of unity polynomial). This conjecture is verified for n = 1, 2.",
