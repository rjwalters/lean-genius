  Let $g(n)$ count the number of $m$ such that $\phi(m)=n$. Is it true that, for every $\epsilon>0$, there exist infinitely many $n$ such that\[g(n) > n^{1-\epsilon}?\]
  
  
  
  Pillai proved that $\limsup g(n)=\infty$ and Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er35b} proved that there exists some constant $c>0$ such that $g(n) >n^c$ for infinitely many $n$.
  
  This conjecture would follow if we knew that, for every $\epsi...
