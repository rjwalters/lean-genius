  Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis (of any finite order) such that $\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert=o(N)$. Is it true that\[\lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{\lvert (A+A)\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}=\infty?\]
  
  
  
  The answer is no, and a counterexample was provided by Turj\'{a}nyi \cite{Tu84}. This was generalised (to the replacement of $A+A$ by the $h$-fold...
