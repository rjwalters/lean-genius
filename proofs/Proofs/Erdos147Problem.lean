  If $H$ is bipartite with minimum degree $r$ then there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(H)>0$ such that\[\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \gg n^{2-\frac{1}{r-1}+\epsilon}.\]
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ErSi84}. A probabilistic argument shows that there exists some $\epsilon=\epsilon(H)>0$ such that\[\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \gg n^{2-\frac{2}{r}+\epsilon}.\]This conjecture was disproved by Janzer \cite{Ja...
