  What is the size of the largest $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that, for all $\emptyset\neq S\subseteq A$, $\sum_{n\in S}n$ is not a square?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s observed that $\lvert A\rvert \gg N^{1/3}$ is possible, taking the first $\approx N^{1/3}$ multiples of some prime $p\approx N^{2/3}$.
  
  Essentially solved by Nguyen and Vu \cite{NgVu10}, who proved that $\lvert A\rvert\ll N^{1/3}(\log N)...
