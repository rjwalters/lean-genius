  Let $s_1<s_2<\cdots$ be the sequence of squarefree numbers. Is it true that, for any $\alpha \geq 0$,\[\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{1}{x}\sum_{s_n\leq x}(s_{n+1}-s_n)^\alpha\]exists?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er51} proved this for all $0\leq \alpha \leq 2$, and Hooley \cite{Ho73} extended this to all $\alpha \leq 3$.
