  Let $f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\in \mathbb{C}[z]$ with $\lvert z_i\rvert \leq 1$ for all $i$. Let $\rho(f)$ be the radius of the largest disc which is contained in $\{z: \lvert f(z)\rvert< 1\}$.
  
  Determine the behaviour of $\rho(f)$. In particular, is it always true that $\rho(f)\gg 1/n$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian, who note that $f(z)=z^n-1$ has $\rho(f) \leq \frac{\pi/...
