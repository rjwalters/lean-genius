  Let $k\leq n$. What choice of $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ (with $\mathrm{gcd}(A)=1$) of size $\lvert A\rvert=k$ maximises the number of integers not representable as the sum of finitely many elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed)? Is it $\{n,n-1,\ldots,n-k+1\}$?
  
  
  
  Associated with problems of Frobenius (see also [433]).
  
  The maximal choice is indeed $\{n,\ldots,n-k+1\}$, as proved by ...
