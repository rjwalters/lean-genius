  Let $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. There are infinitely many $n$ such that $P(n)>P(n+1)>P(n+2)$.
  
  
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Pomerance \cite{ErPo78}, who proved the analogous result for $P(n)<P(n+1)<P(n+2)$. Solved by Balog \cite{Ba01}, who proved that this is true for $\gg \sqrt{x}$ many $n\leq x$ (for all large $x$). Balog suggests the natural conjecture that the den...
