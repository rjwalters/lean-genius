  Let $z_1,z_2,\ldots \in [0,1]$ be an infinite sequence, and define the discrepancy\[D_N(I) = \#\{ n\leq N : z_n\in I\} - N\lvert I\rvert.\]Must there exist some interval $I\subseteq [0,1]$ such that\[\limsup_{N\to \infty}\lvert D_N(I)\rvert =\infty?\]
  
  
  
  The answer is yes, as proved by Schmidt \cite{Sc68}, who later showed \cite{Sc72} that in fact this is true for all but countably many interva...
