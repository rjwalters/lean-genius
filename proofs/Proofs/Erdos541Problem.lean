  Let $a_1,\ldots,a_p$ be (not necessarily distinct) residues modulo $p$, such that there exists some $r$ so that if $S\subseteq [p]$ is non-empty and\[\sum_{i\in S}a_i\equiv 0\pmod{p}\]then $\lvert S\rvert=r$. Must there be at most two distinct residues amongst the $a_i$?
  
  
  
  A question of Graham. This was proved by Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ErSz76} for $p$ sufficiently large and by Gao, ...
