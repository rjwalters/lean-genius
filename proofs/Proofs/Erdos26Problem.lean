  Erdős Problem #26

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/26
  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Let $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ be infinite. Must there exist some $k\geq 1$ such that almost all integers have a divisor of the form $a+k$ for some $a\in A$? Asked by Erdős and Tenenbaum. Ruzsa gave the following simple counterexample: let $A=\{n_10$ there is some $k=k(\epsilon)$ such that at least $1-\epsilon$ density of all integers have a divisor of the form $a+k$ for some $a\in A$.
