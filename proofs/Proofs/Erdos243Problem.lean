Erdős Problem #243: Sylvester's Sequence Characterization

Let a₁ < a₂ < ⋯ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that:
  (1) lim_{n→∞} aₙ / aₙ₋₁² = 1
  (2) Σ (1/aₙ) ∈ ℚ (the sum of reciprocals is rational)

**Conjecture**: For all sufficiently large n, aₙ = aₙ₋₁² - aₙ₋₁ + 1.

This says that any sequence with these properties must eventually follow the
Sylvester recurrence. Sylvester's sequence (OEIS A000058) begins 2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, ...
and has Σ(1/aₙ) = 1.

**Status**: OPEN

**Historical Context**:
- Sylvester (1880) introduced the sequence and observed its unique properties
- Erdős-Straus (1964) proved partial results about the growth rate
- Badea (1993) proved related results for sequences summing to rationals
- The conjecture asks if the growth condition alone (with rational sum) forces Sylvester

/-! ## The Erdős Conjecture

A sequence satisfies the hypotheses if:
1. It is strictly monotone increasing
2. aₙ/aₙ₋₁² → 1 as n → ∞
3. The sum of reciprocals is rational
-/

/-- A sequence is eventually Sylvester if it satisfies the recurrence for large n. -/

  ∀ᶠ n in atTop, a (n + 1) = a n ^ 2 - a n + 1

/-! ## Main Conjecture

Erdős Problem #243: If a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers has
Sylvester-type growth and rational reciprocal sum, it must eventually be Sylvester.

This is stated as an axiom since it remains an open problem.
-/

/-- **Erdős Problem #243** (Open Conjecture)

If a strictly monotone sequence of positive integers satisfies:
- lim aₙ₊₁/aₙ² = 1
- Σ(1/aₙ) converges to a rational number

Then eventually aₙ₊₁ = aₙ² - aₙ + 1 (the Sylvester recurrence).

This conjecture remains open. Erdős-Straus (1964) proved partial results,
and Badea (1993) proved related characterizations, but the full conjecture
in this generality is unresolved.

/-! ## Verification: Sylvester's Sequence Satisfies the Hypotheses

We verify that the canonical Sylvester sequence does satisfy all the hypotheses
(though proving convergence to 1 requires more machinery).
-/

/-- Sylvester's sequence consists of positive integers. -/

  induction n with
  | zero => decide
  | succ n ih =>

/-- The sum of reciprocals of Sylvester's sequence equals 1.

This is a classical result: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/43 + ... = 1.
More precisely, for each n: Σᵢ₌₀ⁿ (1/sᵢ) = 1 - 1/(sₙ₊₁ - 1).
