  Let $f(z)$ be a non-constant entire function such that, for some $c$, the set $E(c)=\{ z: \lvert f(z)\rvert >c\}$ has finite measure.
  
  What is the minimum growth rate of $f(z)$?
  
  If $E(c)$ has finite measure then must there exist $c'<c$ such that $E(c')$ has finite measure?
  
  
  
  This is Problem 2.40 in \cite{Ha74} where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s. Hayman conjectured that\[\int_0^\infty...
