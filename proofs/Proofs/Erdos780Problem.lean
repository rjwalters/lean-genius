  Suppose $n\geq kr+(t-1)(k-1)$ and the edges of the complete $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices are $t$-coloured. Prove that some colour class must contain $k$ pairwise disjoint edges.
  
  
  
  In other words, this problem asks to determine the chromatic number of the Kneser graph. This would be best possible: if $n=kr-1+(t-1)(k-1)$ then decomposing $[n]$ as one set $X_1$ of size $kr-1$ and $t-1$ ...
