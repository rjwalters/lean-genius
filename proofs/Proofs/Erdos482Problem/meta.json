  "overview": "Define a sequence by a₁ = 1 and a_{n+1} = ⌊√2(aₙ + 1/2)⌋. The difference a_{2n+1} - 2·a_{2n-1} gives the n-th binary digit of √2. The problem asks to generalize this to √m and other algebraic numbers.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED - Graham-Pollak (1970) proved the √2 result. Stoll (2005-2006) provided wide-ranging generalizations to quadratic irrationals and beyond. The recurrence elegantly captures the arithmetic structure of algebraic numbers.",
