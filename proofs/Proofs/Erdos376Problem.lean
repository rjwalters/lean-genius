  Are there infinitely many $n$ such that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is coprime to $105$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus \cite{EGRS75} have shown that, for any two odd primes $p$ and $q$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $\binom{2n}{n}$ is coprime to $pq$.
  
  This is equivalent (via Kummer's theorem) to whether there are infinitely many $n$ which have only digits $0,1$ in base $3$, digits ...
