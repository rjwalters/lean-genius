  "overview": "Let f_k(n) be the smallest integer such that any f_k(n) points in general position in ℝ^k contain n points determining a convex polyhedron. Is f_k(n) > (1 + c_k)^n for some c_k > 0?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "NO - DISPROVED by Pohoata-Zakharov (2022) who showed f_3(n) ≤ 2^{o(n)}, which is subexponential. This means no constant c_3 > 0 can give a uniform exponential lower bound. The conjecture fails for all k ≥ 3.",
