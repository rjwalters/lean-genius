  Let $f(n,k)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices and $k$ edges can be partitioned into at most $f(n,k)$ edge-disjoint complete graphs. Estimate $f(n,k)$ for $k>n^2/4$.
  
  
  
  The function $f(n,k)$ is sometimes called the clique partition number.
  
  Erd\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\'{o}sa \cite{EGP66} proved that $f(n,k)\leq n^2/4$ for all $k$ (and in fact the complete graphs can be taken to be edge...
