  "overview": "If n distinct points in ℝ² form a convex polygon, they determine at least ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances. Altman (1963) proved this bound, which is achieved by regular n-gons. The stronger variant asking if some vertex sees ⌊n/2⌋ distances remains open (Problem #982).",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "TRUE - A convex n-gon has at least ⌊n/2⌋ distinct distances. The bound is tight: regular polygons achieve exactly this. Convexity constrains how distances can repeat, forcing this minimum. Related open problems ask about single-vertex distance counts.",
