  Let $f(k)$ be the minimal $n$ such that every set of $n$ consecutive integers $>k$ contains an integer divisible by a prime $>k$. Estimate $f(k)$.
  
  
  
  In other words, how large can a consecutive set of $k$-smooth integers be? Sylvester and Schur (see \cite{Er34}) proved $f(k)\leq k$ and Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er55d} proved\[f(k)<3\frac{k}{\log k}.\]Jutila \cite{Ju74} and Ramachandra, and Shorey \cite{R...
