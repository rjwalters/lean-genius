  Let $G$ be a bipartite graph on $n$ vertices such that one part has $\lfloor n^{2/3}\rfloor$ vertices. Is there a constant $c>0$ such that if $G$ has at least $cn$ edges then $G$ must contain a $C_6$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75} says 'it is easy to see that it contains a $C_8$'.
  
  The answer is no, as shown by De Caen and Sz\'{e}kely \cite{DeSz92}, who in fact show a stronger result. Let $f(n,m...
