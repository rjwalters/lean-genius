  Let $f:\mathbb{N}\to \{-1,1\}$ be a multiplicative function. Is it true that\[ \lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n\leq N}f(n)\]always exists?
  
  
  
  Wintner observed that if $f$ can take complex values on the unit circle then the limit need not exist. A simple example of this is $f(n)=n^i$, as noted by R\'{e}nyi.
  
  The answer is yes, as proved by Wirsing \cite{Wi67}, and generalised by Hal\'{a}...
