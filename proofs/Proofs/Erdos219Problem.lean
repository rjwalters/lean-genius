  Are there arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes?
  
  
  
  The answer is yes, proved by Green and Tao \cite{GrTa08}. The stronger claim that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of consecutive primes is still open.
  
  See also [3] and [141].
  
  This is discussed in problem A5 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}.
