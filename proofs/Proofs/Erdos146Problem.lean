  If $H$ is bipartite and is $r$-degenerate, that is, every induced subgraph of $H$ has minimum degree $\leq r$, then\[\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \ll n^{2-1/r}.\]
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits \cite{ErSi84}. Open even for $r=2$. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov \cite{AKS03} have proved\[\mathrm{ex}(n;H) \ll n^{2-1/4r}.\]They also prove the full Erd\H{o}s-Simonovits conjectured bound if $H$ is bi...
