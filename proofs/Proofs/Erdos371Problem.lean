  Let $P(n)$ denote the largest prime factor of $n$. Show that the set of $n$ with $P(n)<P(n+1)$ has density $1/2$.
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Pomerance \cite{ErPo78}, who proved that this set and its complement both have positive upper density. The best unconditional lower bound available is due to L\"{u} and Wang \cite{LuWa25}, who prove that\[\#\{ n<x :P(n)<P(n+1)\} > (0.2017-o(1))x,\]and...
