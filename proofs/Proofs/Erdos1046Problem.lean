  Let $f\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ be a monic polynomial and\[E=\{ z: \lvert f(z)\rvert <1\}.\]If $E$ is connected then is $E$ contained in a disc of radius $2$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian \cite{EHP58}, who also ask, if $\{ z: \lvert f(z)\rvert\leq 1\}$ is connected, then what are the least possible diameter and greatest possible width of this set, and conjecture the answer is $2$ in...
