# Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis (Wiedijk #24 / Hilbert #1)

## What This Proves
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms with Choice (ZFC).
This means: CH can neither be proven nor disproven from ZFC.

- **Gödel (1940)**: Showed CH is consistent with ZFC (constructible universe L)
- **Cohen (1963)**: Showed ¬CH is consistent with ZFC (forcing)

## Approach
- **Foundation (from Mathlib):** Cardinals, aleph hierarchy, continuum definition
- **Original Contributions:** This file provides an illustrative proof sketch
  showing the conceptual structure: CH statement, two models (L and forcing extensions),
  and how they disagree on CH.
- **Proof Techniques Demonstrated:** Model theory, relative consistency, metamathematics.

## Status
- [ ] Complete proof
- [ ] Uses Mathlib for main result
- [ ] Proves extensions/corollaries
- [x] Pedagogical example
- [x] Incomplete (has sorries)

## Mathlib Dependencies
- `Mathlib.SetTheory.Cardinal.Basic` : Cardinal arithmetic
- `Mathlib.SetTheory.Cardinal.Ordinal` : Ordinals and aleph hierarchy

**Formalization Notes:**
- 2 sorries, 5 axioms capturing key metamathematical facts
- Full formalization of forcing would require thousands of lines
- The abstract structures capture the essence of Gödel-Cohen independence
- See each definition's docstring for implementation rationale

Historical Note: Cantor posed the Continuum Hypothesis in 1878. Hilbert listed
it as his first problem in 1900. The combined work of Gödel (1940) and Cohen (1963)
established that CH is independent of ZFC, earning Cohen the Fields Medal in 1966.

If 𝔠 = ℵ₁ and ℵ₀ < κ < 𝔠, then ℵ₀ < κ < ℵ₁.
But ℵ₁ = Order.succ ℵ₀, and Order.succ_le_of_lt gives Order.succ ℵ₀ ≤ κ,

**Proved: No intermediate cardinal implies CH.**

If no κ exists strictly between ℵ₀ and 𝔠, and 𝔠 > ℵ₀ (Cantor), then 𝔠 = ℵ₁.
Proof: ℵ₁ ≤ 𝔠 (from Cantor + succ_le_of_lt), and ¬(ℵ₁ < 𝔠) (else ℵ₁ is intermediate).

    An inner model of ZFC where every set is "definable" from below.

    Construction:
    - L₀ = ∅
    - L_{α+1} = Def(L_α) (all first-order definable subsets of L_α)
    - L_λ = ⋃_{α<λ} L_α for limit λ

  -- L satisfies the axiom of constructibility
  V_eq_L : True
  -- In L, CH holds
  L_satisfies_CH : True

/-- **Axiom:** The constructible universe L exists and is a model of ZFC.

    **Why an axiom?** Constructing L formally requires:
    1. Transfinite recursion over all ordinals
    2. Definition of "definable subset" (Gödel operations)
    3. Proof that L satisfies each ZFC axiom
    4. This spans ~1000+ lines in formal developments -/

/-- **Axiom:** In L, the Continuum Hypothesis holds.

    **Why an axiom?** Gödel proved:
    1. L satisfies V = L (every set is constructible)
    2. In L, every subset of ω is constructible at a countable stage
    3. This implies |P(ω)^L| = |ω₁^L| = ℵ₁^L

    Key ideas:

    2. Choose a partially ordered set (poset) P in M
    3. Add a "generic filter" G over P to get M[G]
    4. M[G] is a larger model of ZFC

  poset : True  -- Placeholder for forcing poset
  -- The generic filter added

/-- **Axiom:** A forcing extension exists where ¬CH holds.

    **Why an axiom?** Cohen's construction:
    1. Start with a countable transitive model M of ZFC + GCH
    2. Use forcing with P = Fn(ℵ₂ × ω, 2) (finite partial functions)
    3. Each generic filter G adds ℵ₂ new reals
    4. In M[G], |P(ω)| ≥ ℵ₂ > ℵ₁, so CH fails

    Formalizing forcing requires ~2000+ lines of machinery. -/
axiom forcing_extension_exists : ForcingExtension

/-- **Axiom:** In Cohen's forcing extension, CH fails.

    This is the core of Cohen's 1963 result. The generic filter G
    adds ℵ₂ Cohen reals, making the continuum at least ℵ₂. -/

    L is a model of ZFC (proven by verifying each axiom in L).

    M[G] is a model of ZFC where CH fails.

/-- **The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis (Wiedijk #24 / Hilbert #1)**

    The Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZFC:
    - CH cannot be proven from ZFC (because ¬CH is consistent with ZFC)
    - CH cannot be disproven from ZFC (because CH is consistent with ZFC)

    This answers Hilbert's first problem: CH is undecidable in ZFC.

    **Historical significance:**
    - Cantor posed CH in 1878
    - Hilbert listed it as Problem #1 in 1900
    - Gödel showed CH consistent with ZFC in 1940
    - Cohen showed ¬CH consistent with ZFC in 1963

### The Resolution of Hilbert's First Problem

Hilbert asked in 1900: Is the Continuum Hypothesis true?

The answer (Gödel-Cohen, 1940-1963): **The question has no answer in ZFC.**

This was not the kind of answer Hilbert expected, but it reveals something
profound about the nature of mathematical truth and formal systems.

### What Independence Means

1. **Not "unknown"**: Independence is not ignorance. We proved definitively
   that ZFC cannot decide CH either way.

2. **Foundational choice**: Like choosing Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry,
   we can work in ZFC + CH or ZFC + ¬CH. Both are consistent.

3. **New axioms**: Some mathematicians seek new axioms that would decide CH.
   Large cardinal axioms (like projective determinacy) have implications for CH.

### Philosophical Implications

1. **Platonism challenged**: If CH is "really" true or false, why can't ZFC tell us?

2. **Formalism vindicated?**: Perhaps mathematics is just symbol manipulation,
   and some questions have no "correct" answer.

3. **Multiverse view**: Hamkins argues there are many equally valid set-theoretic
   universes—some with CH, some without.

4. **Pragmatism**: Use whichever axiom system serves your purposes.

### The Constructible Universe L

Gödel's L is the "minimal" model of ZFC:
- Every set is definable from earlier sets
- CH holds (in fact, GCH holds)
- No measurable cardinals exist
- Many "large" sets don't exist in L

### Cohen Forcing

Forcing revolutionized set theory:
- Shows how to construct new models from old
- Allows precise control over which statements hold
- Underlies most independence results since 1963
- Forcing axioms (MA, PFA, MM) are now major research areas

### Current Research

The independence of CH didn't end the story:
- **Inner model theory**: Studying L and its generalizations
- **Forcing axioms**: Axioms like Martin's Axiom that have CH consequences
- **Large cardinals**: Supercompact, Woodin cardinals and their effects on CH
- **Multiverse**: Hamkins' philosophical framework for set-theoretic pluralism
