  Let $f(z)$ be an entire function of finite order, and let $\Gamma$ be a rectifiable path on which $f(z)\to \infty$. Let $\ell(r)$ be the length of $\Gamma$ in the disc $\lvert z\rvert<r$.
  
  Find a path for which $\ell(r)$ grows as slowly as possible, and estimate $\ell(r)$ in terms of $M(r)=\max_{\lvert z\rvert=r}\lvert f(z)\rvert$.
  
  In particular, can such a path $\Gamma$ be found for which $\e...
