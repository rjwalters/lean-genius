  "overview": "Let e(n,r) be the minimal number of edges such that every graph on n vertices with ≥ e(n,r) edges, where each edge is in at least one triangle, must have some edge in at least r triangles. Questions: (1) Does e(n,r+1) - e(n,r) → ∞? (2) Does e(n,r+1) / e(n,r) → 1?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - Ruzsa-Szemerédi (1978) proved e(n,r) = o(n²) for fixed r, but both questions about the behavior of consecutive thresholds remain unsolved.",
