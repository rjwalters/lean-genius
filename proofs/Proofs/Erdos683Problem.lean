  Is it true that for every $1\leq k\leq n$ the largest prime divisor of $\binom{n}{k}$, say $P(\binom{n}{k})$, satisfies\[P\left(\binom{n}{k}\right)\geq \min(n-k+1, k^{1+c})\]for some constant $c>0$?
  
  
  
  A theorem of Sylvester and Schur (see \cite{Er34}) states that $P(\binom{n}{k})>k$ if $k\leq n/2$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er55d} proved that there exists some $c>0$ such that, whenever $k\leq n/2$,\[P\l...
