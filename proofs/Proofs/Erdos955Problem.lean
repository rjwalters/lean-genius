  Let\[s(n)=\sigma(n)-n=\sum_{\substack{d\mid n\\ d<n}}d\]be the sum of proper divisors function.
  
  If $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ has density $0$ then $s^{-1}(A)$ must also have density $0$.
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Granville, Pomerance, and Spiro \cite{EGPS90}. It is possible for $s(A)$ to have positive density even if $A$ has zero density (for example taking $A$ to be the product of two dist...
