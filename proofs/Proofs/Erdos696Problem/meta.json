  "overview": "Let h(n) be the largest ℓ such that there is a sequence of primes p₁ < p₂ < ... < pₗ all dividing n with p_{i+1} ≡ 1 (mod p_i). Let H(n) be the analogous function for general divisors. Questions: (1) Estimate h(n) and H(n). (2) Is H(n)/h(n) → ∞ for almost all n?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "PARTIALLY SOLVED - van Doorn proved h(n) → ∞ for almost all n. Erdős conjectured the normal order of h(n) is log*(n) (iterated logarithm). The ratio question H(n)/h(n) → ∞ remains OPEN.",
