  Let $n=p^2+p+1$ for some prime power $p$, and let $A_1,\ldots,A_t\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a block design (so that every pair $x,y\in \{1,\ldots,n\}$ is contained in exactly one $A_i$).
  
  Is it true that if $t>n$ then $t\geq n+p$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and S\'{o}s. The classic finite geometry construction shows that $t=n$ is possible. A theorem of Erd\H{o}s and de Bruijn \cite{dBEr...
