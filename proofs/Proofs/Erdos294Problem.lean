  Let $N\geq 1$ and let $t(N)$ be the least integer $t$ such that there is no solution to\[1=\frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k}\]with $t=n_1<\cdots <n_k\leq N$. Estimate $t(N)$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham \cite{ErGr80} could show\[t(N)\ll\frac{N}{\log N},\]but had no idea of the true value of $t(N)$.
  
  Solved by Liu and Sawhney \cite{LiSa24} (up to $(\log\log N)^{O(1)}$), who proved that\[\frac{N...
