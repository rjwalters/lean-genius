  Statement:
  Let f(n)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n)f(n)f(n) be the maximal number of edges in a graph on n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">nnn vertices such that all cycles have more vertices than diagonals. Is it true that f(n)&#x226A;n" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">f(n)≪nf(n)≪nf(n)\ll n?
