  Find the smallest $h(d)$ such that the following holds. There exists a function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\{-1,1\}$ such that, for every $d\geq 1$,\[\max_{P_d}\left\lvert \sum_{n\in P_d}f(n)\right\rvert\leq h(d),\]where $P_d$ ranges over all finite arithmetic progressions with common difference $d$.
  
  
  
  Cantor, Erd\H{o}s, Schreiber, and Straus \cite{Er66} proved that $h(d)\ll d!$ is possible. Van der Waer...
