  Is it true that, for every $r$, there is a $k$ such that if $I_1,\ldots,I_r$ are disjoint intervals of consecutive integers, all of length at least $k$, then\[\prod_{1\leq i\leq r}\prod_{m\in I_i}m\]is not a perfect power?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge \cite{ErSe75} proved that the product of consecutive integers is never a power (establishing the case $r=1$). The condition that the intervals be l...
