  Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that, given any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, there exist $f(n)$ points such that no two are distance $1$ apart. Estimate $f(n)$. In particular, is it true that $f(n)\geq n/4$?
  
  
  
  In other words, estimate the minimal independence number of a unit distance graph with $n$ vertices. If $\omega$ is the independence number and $\chi$ is the chromatic number then $\omega \c...
