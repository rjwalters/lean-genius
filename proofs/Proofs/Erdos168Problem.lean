  Let $F(N)$ be the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which does not contain any set of the form $\{n,2n,3n\}$. What is\[ \lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{F(N)}{N}?\]Is this limit irrational?
  
  
  
  This limit was proved to exist by Graham, Spencer, and Witsenhausen \cite{GSW77}, who showed it is equal to\[\frac{1}{3}\sum_{k\in K}\frac{1}{d_k},\]where $d_1<d_2<\cdots $are the $3$-smooth numbers a...
