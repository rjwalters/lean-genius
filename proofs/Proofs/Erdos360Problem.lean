  Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that $\{1,\ldots,n-1\}$ can be partitioned into $f(n)$ classes so that $n$ cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct elements from the same class. How fast does $f(n)$ grow?
  
  
  
  Alon and Erd\H{o}s \cite{AlEr96} proved that $f(n) = n^{1/3+o(1)}$, and more precisely\[\frac{n^{1/3}}{(\log n)^{4/3}}\ll f(n) \ll \frac{n^{1/3}}{(\log n)^{1/3}}(\log\log n)^{1/3}.\]Vu \cite{Vu0...
