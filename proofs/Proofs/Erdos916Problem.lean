  Does every graph with $n$ vertices and $2n-2$ edges contain a cycle and another vertex adjacent to three vertices on the cycle?
  
  
  
  This would be a stronger form of the result of Dirac \cite{Di60} that every such graph contains a subgraph homeomorphic to $K_4$.
  
  The answer is yes, as proved by Thomassen \cite{Th74}.
