  We say $H$ is a unique subgraph of $G$ if there is exactly one way to find $H$ as a subgraph (not necessarily induced) of $G$. Is there a graph on $n$ vertices with\[\gg \frac{2^{\binom{n}{2}}}{n!}\]many distinct unique subgraphs?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Entringer \cite{EnEr72}, who constructed a graph with\[\gg 2^{\binom{n}{2}-O(n^{3/2+o(1)})}\]many unique subgraphs. This was improved by...
