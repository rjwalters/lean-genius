  Any graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into $O(n)$ many edge-disjoint cycles and edges.
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, who proved that $O(n\log n)$ many cycles and edges suffices. The graph $K_{3,n-3}$ shows that at least $(1+c)n$ many cycles and edges are required, for some constant $c>0$. In \cite{Er71} Erd\H{o}s suggests that only $n-1$ many cycles and edges are required if we ...
