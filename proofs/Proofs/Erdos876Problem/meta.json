  "overview": "For an infinite sum-free set A = {a₁ < a₂ < ⋯} (no element is a sum of distinct smaller elements), how small can gaps aₙ₊₁ - aₙ be? Is aₙ₊₁ - aₙ < n possible?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "PARTIALLY SOLVED: Graham showed gaps < n^{1+o(1)} achievable. Whether gaps < n is possible remains OPEN. Additional results: sum-free sets have density zero (Erdős), |A ∩ [1,N]| = Θ((N log N)^{1/2}) (Łuczak-Schoen), reciprocal sum < 4 (Sullivan).",
