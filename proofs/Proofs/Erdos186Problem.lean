  Let $F(N)$ be the maximal size of $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ which is 'non-averaging', so that no $n\in A$ is the arithmetic mean of at least two elements in $A$. What is the order of growth of $F(N)$?
  
  
  
  Originally due to Straus. It is known that\[N^{1/4}\ll F(N) \ll N^{1/4+o(1)}.\]The lower bound is due to Bosznay \cite{Bo89} and the upper bound to Pham and Zakharov \cite{PhZa24}, improving ...
