  Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^4$ in which every $x\in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.
  
  Is it true that $f(n)\leq \frac{n}{2}+O(1)$?
  
  
  
  Avis, Erd\H{o}s, and Pach \cite{AEP88} proved that\[\frac{n}{2}+2 \leq f(n) \leq (1+o(1))\frac{n}{2}.\]This was proved by Swanepoel \cite{Sw13}, who in fact proved more generall...
