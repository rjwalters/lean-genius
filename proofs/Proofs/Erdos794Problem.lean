  Is it true that every $3$-uniform hypergraph on $3n$ vertices with at least $n^3+1$ edges must contain either a subgraph on $4$ vertices with $3$ edges or a subgraph on $5$ vertices with $7$ edges?
  
  
  
  Balogh has observed that this problem is probably misstated by Erd\H{o}s - indeed, every graph with $5$ vertices spanning $7$ edges contains a graph on $4$ vertices spanning $3$ edges, so the seco...
