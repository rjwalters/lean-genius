  Let $A=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots\}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be an infinite sequence such that $a_{i+1}-a_i$ is a positive unit vector (i.e. is of the form $(0,0,\ldots,1,0,\ldots,0)$). For which $d$ must $A$ contain a three-term arithmetic progression?
  
  
  
  This is true for $d\leq 3$ and false for $d\geq 4$.
  
  This problem is equivalent to one on 'abelian squares' (see [231]). In particular $A$ can be inte...
