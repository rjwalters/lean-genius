  Let $n> 1$ and $p_1<\cdots<p_n$ denote the first $n$ primes. Let $P=\prod_{1\leq i\leq n}p_i$. Does there always exist some prime $p$ with $p_n<p<P$ such that $P+p$ is prime?
  
  
  
  A problem of Deaconescu. Erd\H{o}s expects that the least such prime is much smaller than $P$, and in fact satisfies $p\leq n^{O(1)}$. Deaconescu has verified this conjecture for $n\leq 1000$.
