  If $\tau(n)$ counts the number of divisors of $n$, then what is the set of limit points of\[\frac{\tau((n+1)!)}{\tau(n!)}?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham noted that any number of the shape $1+1/k$ for $k\geq 1$ is a limit point (and thus so too is $1$), but knew of no others.
  
  Mehtaab Sawhney has shared the following simple argument that proves that the above limit points are in fact the only on...
