  Is\[\sum_{n\geq 2}\frac{\omega(n)}{2^n}\]irrational? (Here $\omega(n)$ counts the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$.)
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er48} proved that $\sum_n \frac{d(n)}{2^n}$ is irrational, where $d(n)$ is the divisor function.
  
  Pratt \cite{Pr24} has proved this is irrational, conditional on a uniform version of the prime $k$-tuples conjecture.
  
  Tao has observed that this i...
