  What is the size of the largest Sidon subset $A\subseteq\{1,2^2,\ldots,N^2\}$? Is it $N^{1-o(1)}$?
  
  
  
  A question of Alon and Erd\H{o}s \cite{AlEr85}, who proved $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{2/3-o(1)}$ is possible (via a random subset), and observed that\[\lvert A\rvert \ll \frac{N}{(\log N)^{1/4}},\]since (as shown by Landau) the density of the sums of two squares decays like $(\log N)^{-1/2}$. The ...
