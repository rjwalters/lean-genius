  "overview": "If G is a graph on n vertices with no clique or independent set on ≫ log n vertices (a 'Ramsey graph'), then G contains an induced subgraph on ≫ n vertices with ≫ √n distinct degrees.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED - Bukh-Sudakov (2007) proved the original conjecture. Jenssen-Keevash-Long-Yepremyan (2020) strengthened this to ≫ n^{2/3} distinct degrees with no vertex count restriction. The exponent 2/3 is believed to be optimal.",
