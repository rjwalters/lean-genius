  Let $r\geq 3$. There exists $c_r>r^{-r}$ such that, for any $\epsilon>0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, the following holds.
  
  Any $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with at least $(1+\epsilon)(n/r)^r$ many edges contains a subgraph on $m$ vertices with at least $c_rm^r$ edges, where $m=m(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er64f} proved that this is true with $c_r=r^{-r}$...
