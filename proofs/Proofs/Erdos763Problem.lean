  Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Can there exist some constant $c>0$ such that\[\sum_{n\leq N} 1_A\ast 1_A(n) = cN+O(1)?\]
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n. Erd\H{o}s and Fuchs \cite{ErFu56} proved that the answer is no in a strong form: in fact even\[\sum_{n\leq N} 1_A\ast 1_A(n) = cN+o\left(\frac{N^{1/4}}{(\log N)^{1/2}}\right)\]is impossible. The error term here was improved to $o(N^{1...
