  What is the size of the largest $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that if $a\leq b\leq c\leq d\in A$ are such that $abcd$ is a square then $ad=bc$?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy, and S\'{o}s. Erd\H{o}s claims that S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy proved that $\lvert A\rvert =o(n)$. The primes show that $\lvert A\rvert \gg n/\log n$ is possible.
