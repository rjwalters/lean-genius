  Let $f(N)$ be the size of the largest quasi-Sidon subset $A\subset\{1,\ldots,N\}$, where we say that $A$ is quasi-Sidon if\[\lvert A+A\rvert=(1+o(1))\binom{\lvert A\rvert}{2}.\]How does $f(N)$ grow?
  
  
  
  Considered by Erd\H{o}s and Freud \cite{ErFr91}, who proved\[\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}+o(1)\right)N^{1/2} \leq f(N) \leq \left(2+o(1)\right)N^{1/2}.\](Although both bounds were already given by Er...
