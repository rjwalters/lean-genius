  Let $\delta_1(n,m)$ be the density of the set of integers with exactly one divisor in $(n,m)$. Is $\delta_1(n,m)$ unimodular for $m>n+1$ (i.e. increases until some $m$ then decreases thereafter)? For fixed $n$, where does $\delta_1(n,m)$ achieve its maximum?
  
  
  
  This was asked by Erd\H{o}s in 1986 at Oberwolfach.
  
  Erd\H{o}s proved that\[\delta_1(n,m) \ll \frac{1}{(\log n)^c}\]for all $m$, fo...
