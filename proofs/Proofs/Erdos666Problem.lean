  Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph (so that $Q_n$ has $2^n$ vertices and $n2^{n-1}$ edges). Is it true that, for every $\epsilon>0$, if $n$ is sufficiently large, every subgraph of $Q_n$ with\[\geq \epsilon n2^{n-1}\]many edges contains a $C_6$?
  
  
  
  In \cite{Er91} Erd\H{o}s further suggests that perhaps, for every $k\geq 3$, there are constants $c$ and $a_k<1$ such that every subgr...
