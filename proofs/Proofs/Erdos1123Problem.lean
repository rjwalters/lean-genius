  Let $B_1$ be the Boolean algebra of sets of integers modulo sets of density $0$ (that is, in which two sets are equivalent if and only if they differ by a set of density $0$) and let $B_2$ be the Boolean algebra of sets modulo sets of logarithmic density $0$.
  
  Prove that $B_1$ and $B_2$ are not isomorphic.
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and Ulam, who noted that the Boolean algebra modulo finite...
