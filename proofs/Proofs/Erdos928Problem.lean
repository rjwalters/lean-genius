  Let $\alpha,\beta\in (0,1)$ and let $P(n)$ denote the largest prime divisor of $n$. Does the density of integers $n$ such that $P(n)<n^{\alpha}$ and $P(n+1)<(n+1)^\beta$ exist?
  
  
  
  
  Dickman \cite{Di30} showed the density of smooth $n$, with largest prime factor $<n^\alpha$, is $\rho(1/\alpha)$ where $\rho$ is the Dickman function.
  
  Erd\H{o}s also asked whether infinitely many such $n$ even...
