  Let $f(m)$ be the maximal $k$ such that a triangle-free graph on $m$ edges must contain a bipartite graph with $k$ edges. Determine $f(m)$.
  
  
  
  Resolved by Alon \cite{Al96}, who showed that there exist constants $c_1,c_2>0$ such that\[\frac{m}{2}+c_1m^{4/5}\leq f(m)\leq \frac{m}{2}+c_2m^{4/5}.\]See also the entry in the graphs problem collection.
