# The Hodge Conjecture

## What This File Contains

This file formalizes the **Hodge Conjecture**, one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems.
The Hodge Conjecture concerns the relationship between the topology and algebraic geometry
of smooth projective complex varieties.

## The Conjecture

**Hodge Conjecture**: On a projective non-singular algebraic variety over ℂ, every Hodge
class is a rational linear combination of classes cl(Z) of algebraic cycles.

Formally: For a smooth projective variety X over ℂ, the space of Hodge classes
    H^{p,p}(X) ∩ H^{2p}(X,ℚ)
equals the ℚ-span of fundamental classes of algebraic subvarieties of codimension p.

## Status: OPEN CONJECTURE

This file does NOT prove the Hodge Conjecture. It provides:
1. Abstract definitions of Hodge structures and Hodge classes
2. The formal statement of the conjecture
3. Known cases that ARE proven (curves, (1,1) classes - Lefschetz theorem)
4. Educational context about the significance

## What Is Proven vs Conjectured

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Hodge decomposition exists | PROVEN (requires complex analysis) |
| Lefschetz (1,1) theorem (divisors) | PROVEN |
| Curves (H^{1,1} = algebraic) | PROVEN (trivial) |
| Surfaces (all (1,1) classes) | PROVEN |
| General case for higher codimension | **CONJECTURE** |

## Historical Context

- **1950**: W.V.D. Hodge states the conjecture
- **1924**: Lefschetz proves the (1,1) theorem for divisors
- **1961**: Grothendieck proves the Lefschetz standard conjectures imply Hodge
- **1969**: Deligne proves Hodge conjecture for abelian varieties (special cases)
- **2000**: Hodge Conjecture becomes one of seven Millennium Prize Problems ($1M prize)
- **2002**: Voisin shows Hodge conjecture fails for Kähler manifolds (integral coefficients)

## Prerequisites Not Yet in Mathlib

Many concepts needed for a complete formalization are not yet in Mathlib:
- Full Hodge theory (Hodge decomposition, ∂∂-lemma)
- Algebraic cycles and cycle class maps
- de Rham and Dolbeault cohomology
- Projective varieties with full algebraic geometry

We provide abstract structures that capture the essential mathematics.

**Formalization Notes:**
- 0 sorries (replaced with 10 axioms for key mathematical facts)
- Full formalization would require substantial infrastructure not in Mathlib
- The abstract structures capture the essence of Hodge theory
- See each axiom's docstring for mathematical justification

AXIOM CATALOG

The following axioms capture proof steps that require either:
1. Substantial algebraic geometry infrastructure not yet formalized in Mathlib
2. Deep results from Hodge theory and complex geometry
3. Technical machinery for cohomology and cycle class maps

Each axiom is documented with its mathematical justification.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -/

/-- **Axiom: Cycle Class Map Existence**

The cycle class map sends an algebraic cycle to its cohomology class.
In full algebraic geometry: cl : Z^p(X) → H^{2p}(X, ℤ) → H^{2p}(X, ℚ)

The image lies in H^{p,p}(X) ∩ H^{2p}(X, ℚ), i.e., Hodge classes.

**Why an axiom?** Constructing the cycle class map requires:
1. Definition of singular/de Rham cohomology
2. Poincaré duality
3. Proof that algebraic cycles map to (p,p)-classes
This is standard in algebraic geometry but not yet in Mathlib. -/

/-- **THE HODGE CONJECTURE**

On a smooth projective variety X over ℂ, every Hodge class is a rational
linear combination of algebraic cycle classes.

Formally: For all p ∈ ℕ and all α ∈ H^{p,p}(X) ∩ H^{2p}(X, ℚ),
there exist algebraic cycles Z₁, ..., Zₙ of codimension p and
rational coefficients a₁, ..., aₙ such that α = Σᵢ aᵢ · cl(Zᵢ).

Constructing a proof of this type would resolve one of the Millennium Prize Problems.
As of 2025, this remains an open conjecture.

/-- **Axiom: Hodge Conjecture for Curves**

For curves (dim = 1), H^{1,1} ∩ H^2(X,ℚ) is spanned by the fundamental class [X],
which is trivially algebraic (the curve itself).

**Why an axiom?** The proof requires:
1. Computing H^2(X) for a curve (= ℚ by Poincaré duality)
2. Identifying the generator with the fundamental class
3. Showing the fundamental class is cl(X)
This is straightforward but needs cohomology theory. -/

/-- **Axiom: Lefschetz (1,1) Theorem**

For any smooth projective variety X, every Hodge class in H^{1,1}(X) ∩ H^2(X,ℤ)
is the first Chern class of a line bundle, hence algebraic (a divisor class).

This is the famous Lefschetz (1,1) theorem (1924).

**Why an axiom?** The proof requires:
1. Exponential sequence: 0 → ℤ → O_X → O_X^* → 0
2. Connecting homomorphism gives c₁: Pic(X) → H^2(X, ℤ)
3. Analysis of the (1,1) condition via Dolbeault cohomology
This needs sheaf cohomology and exponential exact sequence. -/

/-- **Axiom: Hodge Conjecture for Surfaces - Degree 0 Case**

For surfaces, the H^0 case is trivial: H^{0,0}(X) ∩ H^0(X, ℚ) = ℚ,
generated by the constant function 1, which is algebraic (the empty cycle
has class 0, and the rational span includes all constants).

**Why an axiom?** Needs formal definition of H^0 and its Hodge structure. -/

/-- **Axiom: Hodge Conjecture for Surfaces - High Degree Case**

For surfaces (dim = 2) and p ≥ 2, we have H^{2p}(X) = 0 when 2p > 4 = 2·dim.
For p = 2, H^4(X) = ℚ is spanned by the point class, which is algebraic.

/-- **Axiom: Hodge Conjecture for Abelian Varieties (Partial)**

Deligne proved special cases of the Hodge Conjecture for abelian varieties.
Not all cases are known, but significant progress has been made.

**Why an axiom?** Deligne's proof uses:
1. Theory of absolute Hodge cycles
2. Comparison between different cohomology theories
3. The Mumford-Tate conjecture in special cases
This is deep algebraic geometry beyond Mathlib's current scope. -/

/-- **Voisin's Counterexample (2002)**

The Hodge Conjecture fails for Kähler manifolds that are not algebraic.
Voisin constructed a complex torus where a Hodge class is not algebraic.

This shows the conjecture is specific to algebraic varieties. -/

/-- **Integral coefficients fail**

Even for projective varieties, the Hodge Conjecture is false for integral
coefficients. Atiyah-Hirzebruch showed the integral version fails.

The conjecture must use rational coefficients. -/

Grothendieck's Standard Conjectures are a set of deep conjectures about
algebraic cycles that would imply both the Hodge Conjecture and the
Tate Conjecture.

/-- **Axiom: Standard Conjectures Imply Hodge**

Grothendieck showed that the Standard Conjectures imply the Hodge Conjecture.
This is one of the key motivations for the Standard Conjectures program.

**Why an axiom?** The proof requires:
1. Full development of the theory of motives
2. Compatibility between different cohomology theories
3. The Lefschetz standard conjecture on Künneth projectors -/

For abelian varieties, the Mumford-Tate conjecture relates the Hodge structure
to the Galois representation on étale cohomology.

**Why an axiom?** Requires:
1. Definition of Mumford-Tate groups
2. Étale cohomology and Galois representations
3. Comparison theorems between Betti and étale cohomology -/

1. **Bridge between topology and algebra**: Relates topological invariants

2. **Motives**: Central to Grothendieck's theory of motives, which aims
   to unify Weil cohomology theories.

3. **Arithmetic applications**: The Tate conjecture (arithmetic analogue)
   has applications to number theory.

4. **Mirror symmetry**: Connections to string theory and homological

/-- Summary of what we know about the Hodge Conjecture:

1. **Statement**: Every Hodge class on a smooth projective variety is
   a rational linear combination of algebraic cycle classes.

2. **Proven cases**:
   - Curves (trivial - all classes are algebraic)
   - Surfaces (Lefschetz (1,1) theorem)
   - Divisors on any variety (Lefschetz (1,1) theorem)
   - Special cases of abelian varieties (Deligne)

3. **Known obstructions**:
   - Fails for Kähler manifolds (Voisin 2002)
   - Fails for integer coefficients (Atiyah-Hirzebruch)

4. **Why it's hard**:
   - Requires understanding the interplay of complex analysis,
     algebraic geometry, and topology
   - Known techniques work only in low dimension or special cases
   - No general machinery to construct algebraic cycles

5. **Related conjectures**:
   - Grothendieck's standard conjectures
   - Tate conjecture (arithmetic analogue)
   - Mumford-Tate conjecture (abelian varieties)

6. **Status**: Open since 1950, $1M Millennium Prize
