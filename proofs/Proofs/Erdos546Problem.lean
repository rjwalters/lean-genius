  Erdős Problem #546

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/546
  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Let $G$ be a graph with no isolated vertices and $m$ edges. Is it true that\[R(G) \leq 2^{O(m^{1/2})}?\] This is true, and was proved by Sudakov [Su11]. The analogous question for $\geq 3$ colours is still open. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov [AKS03] had earlier given a short proof of this when $G$ is bipartite. A more precise question is [545]. This problem is #11 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 18 November 2025.
