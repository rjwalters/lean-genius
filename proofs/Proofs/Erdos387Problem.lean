  Is there an absolute constant $c>0$ such that, for all $1\leq k< n$, the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ has a divisor in $(cn,n]$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s once conjectured that $\binom{n}{k}$ must always have a divisor in $(n-k,n]$, but this was disproved by Schinzel and Erd\H{o}s \cite{Sc58}. A counterexample is given by $n=99215$ and $k=15$. Schinzel conjectured (see problem B34 of \cite{Gu04}) tha...
