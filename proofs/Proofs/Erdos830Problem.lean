  We say that $a,b\in \mathbb{N}$ are an amicable pair if $\sigma(a)=\sigma(b)=a+b$. Are there infinitely many amicable pairs? If $A(x)$ counts the number of amicable $1\leq a\leq b\leq x$ then is it true that\[A(x)>x^{1-o(1)}?\]
  
  
  
  For example $220$ and $284$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er55b} proved that $A(x)=o(x)$, and Pomerance \cite{Po81} improved this to\[A(x) \leq x \exp(-(\log x)^{1/3})\]and later ...
