  Let $h_t(d)$ be minimal such that every graph $G$ with $h_t(d)$ edges and maximal degree $\leq d$ contains two edges whose shortest path between them has length $\geq t$.
  
  Estimate $h_t(d)$.
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er88} wrote 'This problem seems to be interesting only if there is a nice expression for $h_t(d)$.'
  
  It is easy to see that $h_t(d)\le...
