  Let $N\geq 1$. What is the largest $t$ such that there are $A_1,\ldots,A_t\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ with $A_i\cap A_j$ a non-empty arithmetic progression for all $i\neq j$?
  
  
  
  Simonovits and S\'{o}s \cite{SiSo81} have shown that $t\ll N^2$.
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham asked whether the maximal $t$ is achieved when we take the $A_i$ to be all arithmetic progressions in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ containing ...
