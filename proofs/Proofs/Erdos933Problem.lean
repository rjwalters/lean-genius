  If $n(n+1)=2^k3^lm$, where $(m,6)=1$, then is it true that\[\limsup_{n\to \infty} \frac{2^k3^l}{n\log n}=\infty?\]
  
  
  
  Mahler proved (a more general result that implies in particular) that\[2^k3^l<n^{1+o(1)}.\]Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er76d} wrote 'it is easy to see' that for infinitely many $n$\[2^k3^l>n\log n.\]Steinerberger has noted a simple proof of this fact follows from taking $n=2^{3^r}$ for any ...
