  Does every set of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ determine $\gg n/\sqrt{\log n}$ many distinct distances?
  
  
  
  A $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ integer grid shows that this would be the best possible. Nearly solved by Guth and Katz \cite{GuKa15} who proved that there are always $\gg n/\log n$ many distinct distances.
  
  A stronger form (see [604]) may be true: is there a single point which det...
