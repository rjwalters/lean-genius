  Show that the equation\[n! = a_1!a_2!\cdots a_k!,\]with $n-1>a_1\geq a_2\geq \cdots \geq a_k\geq 2$, has only finitely many solutions.
  
  
  
  This would follow if $P(n(n+1))/\log n\to \infty$, where $P(m)$ denotes the largest prime factor of $m$ (see Problem [368]). Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er76d} proved that this problem would also follow from showing that $P(n(n-1))>4\log n$.
  
  The condition $a_1<n-1$ ...
