  Let $k\geq 3$. Can the product of any $k$ consecutive integers $N$ ever be powerful? That is, must there always exist a prime $p\mid N$ such that $p^2\nmid N$?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge. There are infinitely many $n$ such that $n(n+1)$ is powerful (see [364]). Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge \cite{ErSe75} proved that $N$ can never be a perfect power. Erd\H{o}s remarked that this 'seems ...
