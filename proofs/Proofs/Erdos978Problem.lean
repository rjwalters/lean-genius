  Let $f\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be an irreducible polynomial of degree $k>2$ (and suppose that $k\neq 2^l$ for any $l\geq 1$).
  
  Does the set of integers $n$ for which $f(n)$ is $(k-1)$-power-free have positive density?
  
  Are there infinitely many $n$ for which $f(n)$ is $(k-2)$-power-free?
  
  In particular, does\[n^4+2\]represent infinitely many squarefree numbers?
