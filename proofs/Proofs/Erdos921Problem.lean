  Let $k\geq 4$ and let $f_k(n)$ be the largest $m$ such that there is a graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $k$ in which every odd cycle has length $> m$. Is it true that\[f_k(n) \asymp n^{\frac{1}{k-2}}?\]
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai. Gallai \cite{Ga63} proved that\[f_4(n) \gg n^{1/2}\]and Erd\H{o}s (unpublished) proved $f_4(n) \ll n^{1/2}$.
  
  This was proved for all $k\geq...
