Erdős Problem #701: Chvátal's Conjecture on Intersecting Families

Source: https://erdosproblems.com/701
Status: OPEN

Statement:
Let F be a family of sets closed under taking subsets (hereditary family).
There exists an element x such that for any intersecting subfamily F' ⊆ F:
  |F'| ≤ |{A ∈ F : x ∈ A}|

The conjecture asserts that the maximum size of an intersecting subfamily
is achieved by a "star" (all sets containing some fixed element x).

Background:
This is known as Chvátal's Conjecture, proposed in 1974. It concerns the
structure of hereditary families (also called downsets or ideals) and
generalizes the classical Erdős-Ko-Rado theorem.

Known Partial Results:
- Chvátal (1974): Proved under a stronger injection-based ordering
- Sterboul (1974): Proved when maximal sets have equal size, pairwise
  intersections have size ≤1, and ≥2 maximal sets intersect
- Borg (2011): Proposed weighted generalization
- Frankl-Kupavskii (2023): Proved for families with covering number 2

and there exists an injection f : F → F such that f(A) ⊂ A for all non-minimal A,
then the maximum intersecting subfamily is a star.

## Part VI: Connection to Erdős-Ko-Rado
-/

/--
**Erdős-Ko-Rado Context:**
The EKR theorem bounds intersecting families in uniform hypergraphs.
Chvátal's conjecture generalizes this to hereditary families.

For uniform families (all sets have size k), EKR says the maximum
intersecting family has size C(n-1, k-1), achieved by a star.
-/

/--
**Uniform Families:**
If F consists of all k-subsets of [n], then F is NOT hereditary
(unless k = 0 or 1). The hereditary closure would add all smaller sets.

## Part VII: Examples and Special Cases

/--
**Example: Boolean lattice**
F = 2^[n] is hereditary. The star at x has size 2^(n-1).
Any intersecting family has size ≤ 2^(n-1) (classical result).

**Example: Fano plane**
The Fano plane matroid's independent sets form a hereditary family
where Chvátal's conjecture holds.

/--
**Erdős Problem #701: Status**

**Conjecture (Chvátal, 1974):**
For any hereditary family F, there exists an element x such that
every intersecting subfamily F' has |F'| ≤ |Star(F, x)|.

**Status:** OPEN

**Known Results:**
- Holds under injection-based ordering (Chvátal 1974)
- Holds under Sterboul conditions (1974)
- Holds for covering number 2 (Frankl-Kupavskii 2023)
- Weighted version partially resolved (Borg 2011)

**Why It's Hard:**
The conjecture requires finding a SINGLE element x that works
for ALL intersecting subfamilies simultaneously. Local arguments
don't suffice; global structure is needed.
