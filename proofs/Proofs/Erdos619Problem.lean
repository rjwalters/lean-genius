  For a triangle-free graph $G$ let $h_r(G)$ be the smallest number of edges that need to be added to $G$ so that it has diameter $r$ (while preserving the property of being triangle-free).
  
  Is it true that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that if $G$ is a connected graph on $n$ vertices then $h_4(G)<(1-c)n$?
