  Let $f(z)$ be an entire function, not a polynomial. Does there exist a locally rectifiable path $C$ tending to infinity such that, for every $\lambda>0$, the integral\[\int_C \lvert f(z)\rvert^{-\lambda} \mathrm{d}z\]is finite?
  
  
  
  Huber \cite{Hu57} proved that for every $\lambda>0$ there is such a path $C_\lambda$ such that this integral is finite.
  
  This is true. The case when $f$ has finit...
