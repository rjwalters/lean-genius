  Let $f_r(n)$ be minimal such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\geq f_r(n)$ edges and chromatic number $\geq r$ contains a triangle. Determine $f_r(n)$.
  
  
  
  Tur\'{a}n's theorem implies $f_2(n)=\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+1$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai \cite{Er62d} proved $f_3(n)=\lfloor \frac{1}{4}(n-1)^2\rfloor+2$.
