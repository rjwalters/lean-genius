  The cycle set of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is a set $A\subseteq \{3,\ldots,n\}$ such that there is a cycle in $G$ of length $\ell$ if and only if $\ell \in A$. Let $f(n)$ count the number of possible such $A$.
  
  Prove that $f(n)=o(2^n)$.
  
  Prove that $f(n)/2^{n/2}\to \infty$.
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Faudree, who showed that $2^{n/2}<f(n) \leq 2^{n-2}$. The first problem was solv...
