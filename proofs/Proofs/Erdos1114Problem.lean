  Let $f(x)\in \mathbb{R}[x]$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ whose roots $\{a_0<\cdots<a_n\}$ are all real and form an arithmetic progression.
  
  The differences between consecutive zeros of $f'(x)$, beginning from the midpoint of $(a_0,a_m)$ towards the endpoints, are monotonically increasing.
  
  
  
  All the zeros of $f'(x)$ are all distinct real numbers in $(a_0,a_m)$ by Rolle's theorem.
