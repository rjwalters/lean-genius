  Does every convex polygon have a vertex with no other $4$ vertices equidistant from it?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s originally conjectured this (in \cite{Er46b}) with no $3$ vertices equidistant, but Danzer found a {IMAGE=97-Danzer,convex polygon} on 9 points such that every vertex has three vertices equidistant from it (but this distance depends on the vertex). Danzer's construction is explained in \cite{Er8...
