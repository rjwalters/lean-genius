  Let $g(n)$ be maximal such that in any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with no four points on a line there exists a subset on $g(n)$ points with no three points on a line. Estimate $g(n)$.
  
  
  
  The trivial greedy algorithm gives $g(n)\gg n^{1/2}$. A similar question can be asked for a set with no $k$ points on a line, searching for a subset with no $l$ points on a line, for any $3\leq l<k$.
