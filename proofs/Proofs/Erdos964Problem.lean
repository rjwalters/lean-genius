  Let $\tau(n)$ count the number of divisors of $n$. Is the sequence\[\frac{\tau(n+1)}{\tau(n)}\]everywhere dense in $(0,\infty)$?
  
  
  
  This follows easily from the generalised prime $k$-tuple conjecture. Eberhard \cite{Eb25} has proved this unconditionally, and in fact proved that all positive rationals can be written as such a ratio.
  
  See also [946].
