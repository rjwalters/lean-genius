  If $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ is a finite set of integers which is dissociated (that is, all of the subset sums are distinct) then\[\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}<2.\]
  
  
  
  This was proved by Ryavec, who did not appear to ever publish the proof. Ryavec's proof is reproduced in \cite{BeEr74}. More generally, Ryavec's proof delivers that\[\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}\leq 2-2^{1-\lvert A\rvert},\]with equality if a...
