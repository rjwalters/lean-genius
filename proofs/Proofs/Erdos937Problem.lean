  Are there infinitely many four-term arithmetic progressions of coprime powerful numbers (i.e. if $p\mid n$ then $p^2\mid n$)?
  
  
  
  A classic theorem of Fermat states that there are no four squares in arithmetic progression.
  
  Without the coprimality condition this is easy, since if $a,a+d,\ldots,a+(k-1)d$ is an arithmetic progression of powerful numbers then so too is\[a(a+kd)^2,\ldots,(a+(k-1...
