  A planar graph on $n$ vertices with $3n-6$ edges (the maximum possible) is called saturated. Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2}\rfloor$ edges contain a saturated planar graph with $>3$ vertices?
  
  
  
  A saturated planar graph on $3$ vertices is a triangle, which by Tur\'{a}n's theorem is contained in every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfl...
