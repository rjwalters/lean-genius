  Let $f(u)$ be the largest $v$ such that no $m\in (u,v)$ is composed entirely of primes dividing $uv$. Estimate $f(u)$.
  
  
  
  An equivalent definition is that $v$ is the smallest number $>u$ such that all prime factors of $v$ are factors of $u$. In particular, we trivially have\[u+2\leq f(u)\leq u^2.\]Cambie has noted that when $u=p$ is a prime, $f(p)=p^2$, and if $u$ is even then $f(u)\leq 2^k$, w...
