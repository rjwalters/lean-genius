  Is it true that there are only finitely many collections of disjoint intervals $I_1,\ldots,I_n$ of size $\lvert I_i\rvert \geq 4$ for $1\leq i\leq n$ such that\[\prod_{1\leq i\leq n}\prod_{m\in I_i}m\]is a square?
  
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Selfridge have proved that the product of consecutive integers is never a power. The condition $\lvert I_i\rvert \geq 4$ is necessary here, since Pomerance has obs...
