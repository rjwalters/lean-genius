  Let $F(x)$ be the maximal $k$ such that there exist $n+1,\ldots,n+k\leq x$ with $\tau(n+1),\ldots,\tau(n+k)$ all distinct (where $\tau(m)$ counts the divisors of $m$). Estimate $F(x)$. In particular, is it true that\[F(x) \leq (\log x)^{O(1)}?\]In other words, is there a constant $C>0$ such that, for all large $x$, every interval $[x,x+(\log x)^C]$ contains two integers with the same number of divisors...
