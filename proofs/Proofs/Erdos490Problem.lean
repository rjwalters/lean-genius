  Let $A,B\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ be such that all the products $ab$ with $a\in A$ and $b\in B$ are distinct. Is it true that\[\lvert A\rvert \lvert B\rvert \ll \frac{N^2}{\log N}?\]
  
  
  
  This would be best possible, for example letting $A=[1,N/2]\cap \mathbb{N}$ and $B=\{ N/2<p\leq N: p\textrm{ prime}\}$.
  
  This is true, and was proved by Szemer\'{e}di \cite{Sz76}.
