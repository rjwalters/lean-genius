  Erdős Problem #157: Infinite Sidon Set as Asymptotic Basis

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/157
  Status: SOLVED (Pilatte 2023)

  Statement:
  Does there exist an infinite Sidon set which is an asymptotic basis of order 3?

  Answer: YES.

  Definition Recap:
  - A Sidon set (B₂ sequence) has all pairwise sums distinct: a+b = c+d implies {a,b} = {c,d}
  - An asymptotic basis of order k: every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most k elements

  Key Results:

/-! ## Sidon Sets -/

/-- A set A is a **Sidon set** (B₂ sequence) if all pairwise sums are distinct.
    Equivalently: a + b = c + d with a ≤ b, c ≤ d implies (a,b) = (c,d). -/
def IsSidon (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ a b c d : ℕ, a ∈ A → b ∈ A → c ∈ A → d ∈ A →
    a ≤ b → c ≤ d → a + b = c + d → (a = c ∧ b = d)

/-- Alternative characterization: the sumset A + A has no repeated elements. -/
def IsSidonAlt (A : Set ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ s : ℕ, (Set.ncard { (a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a ∈ A ∧ b ∈ A ∧ a ≤ b ∧ a + b = s }) ≤ 1

/-- The two definitions are equivalent. -/

/-! ## Asymptotic Bases -/

/-- The k-fold sumset: sums of at most k elements from A. -/
def SumsetK (A : Set ℕ) (k : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  { n | ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card ≤ k ∧ ↑S ⊆ A ∧ n = S.sum id }

/-- A set A is an **asymptotic basis of order k** if every sufficiently large
    integer can be represented as a sum of at most k elements of A. -/
def IsAsymptoticBasis (A : Set ℕ) (k : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ N₀ : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N₀, n ∈ SumsetK A k

/-- A set is an **exact basis of order k** if every positive integer is
    representable (no asymptotic qualification). -/
def IsExactBasis (A : Set ℕ) (k : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, n > 0 → n ∈ SumsetK A k

/-- No Sidon set can be an asymptotic basis of order 2.

This is because Sidon sets are too sparse: |A ∩ [1,N]| ≤ √N + O(1),
but an asymptotic basis of order 2 needs |A ∩ [1,N]| ≫ √N. -/

/-- Sidon sets have counting function at most √N + O(N^{1/4}). -/
axiom sidon_counting_bound (A : Set ℕ) (hSidon : IsSidon A) :
    ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ N : ℕ, (Set.ncard (A ∩ Set.Icc 1 N) : ℝ) ≤ Real.sqrt N + C * N^(1/4 : ℝ)

/-- Asymptotic bases of order k have counting function at least N^{1/k}. -/
axiom basis_counting_lower (A : Set ℕ) (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 1) (hBasis : IsAsymptoticBasis A k) :
    ∃ c : ℝ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ᶠ N in Filter.atTop,
      c * (N : ℝ)^(1/k : ℝ) ≤ Set.ncard (A ∩ Set.Icc 1 N)

/-! ## Construction Outline

Pilatte's construction uses a probabilistic method combined with careful
analysis of the Sidon condition and sumset structure.

The key insight is that while Sidon sets are sparse (∼ √N elements up to N),
they are dense enough to form an asymptotic basis of order 3 because
3√N > N^{1/3} for large N.
