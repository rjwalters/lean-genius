  Let $N\geq 1$. What is the size of the largest $A\subset \{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that $[a,b]\leq N$ for all $a,b\in A$, where $[a,b]$ is the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$?
  
  Is it attained by choosing all integers in $[1,(N/2)^{1/2}]$ together with all even integers in $[(N/2)^{1/2},(2N)^{1/2}]$?
  
  
  
  Let $g(N)$ denote the size of the largest such $A$. The construction mentioned proves tha...
