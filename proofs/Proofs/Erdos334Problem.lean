  Find the best function $f(n)$ such that every $n$ can be written as $n=a+b$ where both $a,b$ are $f(n)$-smooth (that is, are not divisible by any prime $p>f(n)$.)
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s originally asked if even $f(n)\leq n^{1/3}$ is true. This is known, and the best bound is due to Balog \cite{Ba89} who proved that\[f(n) \ll_\epsilon n^{\frac{4}{9\sqrt{e}}+\epsilon}\]for all $\epsilon>0$. (Note $\frac{4}...
