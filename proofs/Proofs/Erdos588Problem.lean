  Let $f_k(n)$ be minimal such that if $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have no $k+1$ points on a line then there must be at most $f_k(n)$ many lines containing at least $k$ points. Is it true that\[f_k(n)=o(n^2)\]for $k\geq 4$?
  
  
  
  A generalisation of [101] (which asks about $k=4$).
  
  The restriction to $k\geq 4$ is necessary since Sylvester has shown that $f_3(n)= n^2/6+O(n)$. (See also Burr, Gr\...
