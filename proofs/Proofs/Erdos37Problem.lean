  Statement:
  We say that $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ is an essential component if $d_s(A+B)>d_s(B)$ for every $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $00$ such that $\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \geq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$. Furthermore, Ruzsa proves that this is best possible, in that for any $c>0$ there exists an essential component $A$ for which $\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \leq (\log N)^{1+c}$ for all large $N$. In [Ru99] Ruzsa states "The simplest set with a chance to be an essential component is t...
