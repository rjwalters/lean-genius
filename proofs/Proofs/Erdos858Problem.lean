  Let $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ be such that there is no solution to $at=b$ with $a,b\in A$ and the smallest prime factor of $t$ is $>a$. Estimate the maximum of\[\frac{1}{\log N}\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}.\]
  
  
  
  Alexander \cite{Al66} and Erd\H{o}s, S\'{a}rk\"{o}zi, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{ESS68} proved that this maximum is $o(1)$ (as $N\to \infty$). This condition on $A$ is a weaker form of the u...
