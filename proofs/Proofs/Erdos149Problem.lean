  Let $G$ be a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$. Is $G$ the union of at most $\tfrac{5}{4}\Delta^2$ sets of strongly independent edges (sets such that the induced subgraph is the union of vertex-disjoint edges)?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il in 1985 (see \cite{FGST89}). This is equivalent to asking whether the chromatic number of the square of the line graph $L(G)^2$ is at most $\f...
