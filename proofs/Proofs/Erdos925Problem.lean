  Is there a constant $\delta>0$ such that, for all large $n$, if $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices which is not Ramsey for $K_3$ (i.e. there exists a 2-colouring of the edges of $G$ with no monochromatic triangle) then $G$ contains an independent set of size $\gg n^{1/3+\delta}$?
  
  
  
  It is easy to show that there exists an independent set of size $\gg n^{1/3}$.
  
  In other words, this question ask...
