  Is there an infinite graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$ and is not the union of countably many triangle-free graphs?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. Folkman \cite{Fo70} and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"{o}dl \cite{NeRo75} have proved that for every $n\geq 1$ there is a graph $G$ which contains no $K_4$ and is not the union of $n$ triangle-free graphs.
  
  See also [582] and [596].
