  Erdős Problem #996: Strong Law of Large Numbers for Lacunary Sequences

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/996
  Status: PARTIALLY SOLVED (Matsuyama 1966 improved earlier bounds)

  Statement:
  Let n₁ < n₂ < ... be a lacunary sequence of integers, and let f ∈ L²([0,1]).
  Let fₙ be the nth partial sum of the Fourier series of f. Is there an
  absolute constant C > 0 such that, if

      ‖f - fₙ‖₂ ≪ 1/(log log log n)^C

  then for almost every α:

      lim_{N→∞} (1/N) Σₖ≤N f({α·nₖ}) = ∫₀¹ f(x)dx

  Historical Context:
  This problem connects harmonic analysis (Fourier series) with probability
  theory (strong law of large numbers) and ergodic theory.

  Key Results:
  - Raikov: Proved for nₖ = aᵏ (geometric sequences)
  - Kac-Salem-Zygmund (1948): Works if ‖f - fₙ‖₂ = O(1/(log n)^c) for c > 1
  - Erdős (1949): Works if ‖f - fₙ‖₂ = O(1/(log log n)^c) for c > 1
  - Matsuyama (1966): Improved to c > 1/2 for log log

  The question asks if log log log suffices with some power C.

/- ## Part V: Known Results -/

/-- **Raikov's Theorem**: For geometric sequences nₖ = aᵏ, the strong law
    holds for all f ∈ L² without any decay condition on Fourier error.

    This is the cleanest case: geometric sequences have enough
    "independence" for the strong law to hold unconditionally. -/
/-- **Kac-Salem-Zygmund (1948)**: If the Fourier error decays like
    1/(log n)^c for c > 1, the strong law holds for any lacunary sequence.

    This was the first general result for lacunary sequences. -/
/-- **Erdős (1949)**: Improved to 1/(log log n)^c for c > 1.

    This was a significant improvement, replacing log with log log. -/
/-- **Matsuyama (1966)**: Further improved to c > 1/2 for log log decay.

    This is currently the best known result for log log decay. -/

/- ## Part VI: The Open Question -/

/-- **Erdős Problem #996**: Is there a constant C such that if the Fourier
    error decays like 1/(log log log n)^C, the strong law holds?

    This asks whether we can go one step further from log log to log log log. -/

/-- The hierarchy of decay conditions, from strongest to weakest:
    1. No decay needed (Raikov, for geometric sequences)
    2. 1/(log n)^c for c > 1 (Kac-Salem-Zygmund)
    3. 1/(log log n)^c for c > 1 (Erdős 1949)
    4. 1/(log log n)^c for c > 1/2 (Matsuyama 1966)
    5. 1/(log log log n)^C for some C? (Problem #996) -/

  , sufficient := false }  -- Unknown!

/- ## Part IX: Why Lacunary Sequences? -/

/-- Lacunary sequences have a "quasi-independence" property.
    The sequence {α·nₖ} mod 1 behaves almost like independent random variables.

    This is why the strong law (a probabilistic statement) applies. -/
theorem lacunary_quasi_independent {n : ℕ → ℕ} (hn : IsLacunary n) :
    True := by  -- Placeholder for the quasi-independence property
  trivial

/-- Non-lacunary sequences can fail the strong law.
    For example, consecutive integers n(k) = k+1 don't satisfy it because
    the ratio (k+2)/(k+1) → 1 as k → ∞, so no ratio > 1 can be a lower bound. -/

  intro ⟨ratio, hratio, hseq⟩
  have hpos : ratio - 1 > 0 := by linarith
  obtain ⟨m, hm⟩ := exists_nat_gt (1 / (ratio - 1))

## Summary

This file formalizes Erdős Problem #996 on the strong law of large numbers
for lacunary sequences.

**Status**: PARTIALLY SOLVED (log log decay) / OPEN (log log log decay)

**The Problem**: For lacunary sequences and L² functions, if the Fourier
error decays like 1/(log log log n)^C, does the strong law hold?

**What we formalize**:
1. Lacunary sequences (exponentially growing gaps)
2. Fourier partial sums and error
3. Ergodic averages along lacunary sequences
4. The strong law of large numbers
5. Known results: Raikov, Kac-Salem-Zygmund, Erdős, Matsuyama
6. The open question about log log log decay
7. Related questions about floor powers and bounded functions

**Key insight**: Lacunary sequences have quasi-independence, allowing
probabilistic tools (law of large numbers) to apply. The question is
how much Fourier regularity is needed.

**Historical Note**: This problem sits at the intersection of harmonic
analysis, probability, and ergodic theory. The progression from log
to log log (Erdős 1949) to log log with c > 1/2 (Matsuyama 1966)
suggests that log log log might also work.
