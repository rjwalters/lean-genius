  Let $t_n$ be minimal such that $\{n+1,\ldots,n+t_n\}$ contains a subset whose product with $n$ is a square number (and let $t_n=0$ if $n$ is itself square). Estimate $t_n$.
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Graham, and Selfridge. For example, $t_6=6$ since $6\cdot 8\cdot 12=24^2$. It is trivial that $t_n\geq P(n)$, where $P(n)$ is the largest prime divisor of $n$.
