  If $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ form a convex polygon then they determine at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ distinct distances.
  
  
  
  Solved by Altman \cite{Al63}. The stronger variant that says there is one point which determines at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ distinct distances (see [982]) is still open. Fishburn in fact conjectures that if $R(x)$ counts the number of distinc...
