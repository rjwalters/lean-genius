  Let $f(n)$ denote the minimal $m\geq 1$ such that\[n! = a_1\cdots a_t\]with $a_1<\cdots <a_t=a_1+m$. What is the behaviour of $f(n)$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham write that they do not even know whether $f(n)=1$ infinitely often (i.e. whether a factorial is the product of two consecutive integers infinitely often).
  
  Let $F_m(N)$ count the number of $n\leq N$ such that $f(n)=m$. Berend and Osgoo...
