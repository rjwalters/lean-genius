  If $\mathcal{F}$ is a family of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ then we write $G_{\mathcal{F}}$ for the graph on $\mathcal{F}$ where $A\sim B$ if $A$ and $B$ are comparable - that is, $A\subseteq B$ or vice versa.
  
  Is it true that, if $\epsilon>0$ and $n$ is sufficiently large, whenever $m\leq (2-\epsilon)2^{n/2}$ the graph $G_\mathcal{F}$ has $<2^{n}$ many edges?
  
  Is it true that if $G_{\mathcal{F...
