  Give an asymptotic formula for $R(3,k)$.
  
  
  
  It is known that there exists some constant $c>0$ such that for large $k$\[(c+o(1))\frac{k^2}{\log k}\leq R(3,k) \leq (1+o(1))\frac{k^2}{\log k}.\]The lower bound is due to Kim \cite{Ki95}, the upper bound is due to Shearer \cite{Sh83}, improving an earlier bound of Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{AKS80}.
  
  The value of $c$ in the lower ...
