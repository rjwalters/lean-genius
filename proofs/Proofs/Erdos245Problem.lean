  Erdős Problem #245: Sumset Growth Ratio

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/245
  Status: SOLVED (Freiman 1973)

  Statement:
  Let A ⊆ ℕ be an infinite set with |A ∩ {1,...,N}| = o(N) (zero density).
  Is it true that
    lim sup_{N→∞} |((A+A) ∩ {1,...,N})| / |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≥ 3?

  Answer: YES, proved by G.A. Freiman (1973).

  History:
  - Erdős noted it is "easy to see" that the limsup is ≥ 2
  - He conjectured the bound 3 is optimal (achieved by certain sparse sets)
  - Freiman proved the ≥ 3 bound in his foundational work on additive combinatorics
  - The result is part of Freiman's structural theory of set addition

  Key Insight:
  For a set A of zero density, the sumset A + A = {a + b : a, b ∈ A} grows
  at least 3 times as fast as A itself (asymptotically). This is because
  zero-density sets have "room to spread" when forming sums.

  The constant 3 is best possible: consider A = {2^k : k ∈ ℕ}. Then
  A + A contains roughly 3n/2 elements up to 2^n, while A has n elements.

/- ## Part III: The Lower Bound of 2

Erdős stated it is "easy to see" that the limsup is at least 2.
This follows from Mann's theorem (1960) on sumset densities.
-/

/-- **Mann's Theorem (1960) - Weak Form**

    For any infinite set A ⊆ ℕ with zero density, the asymptotic
    growth ratio of A + A over A is at least 2.

    Reference: Mann, H. B., "A refinement of the fundamental theorem
    on the density of the sum of two sets of integers." Pacific J. Math. (1960).

    This is stated as an axiom because the proof requires advanced
    density arguments beyond basic Mathlib. -/

/-- **Freiman's Theorem (1973) - Erdős Problem #245**

    For any infinite set A ⊆ ℕ with zero density, the asymptotic
    growth ratio of A + A over A is at least 3.

    More precisely:
    lim sup_{N→∞} |((A+A) ∩ {1,...,N})| / |A ∩ {1,...,N}| ≥ 3

    Reference: Freiman, G. A., "Foundations of a structural theory
    of set addition." (1973).

    This bound is sharp, as shown by geometric progressions. -/

/- ## Part V: Optimality and Examples

The bound 3 is best possible. The key example is geometric progressions.
-/

/-- Powers of 2 form an infinite set. -/
theorem powers_of_two_infinite : {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 2^k}.Infinite := by
  apply Set.infinite_of_injective_forall_mem (f := fun k => 2^k)
  · intro k₁ k₂ h
    exact Nat.pow_right_injective (by norm_num : 1 < 2) h
  · intro k
    exact ⟨k, rfl⟩

/-- Powers of 2 have zero density (exponential growth vs linear). -/
axiom powers_of_two_zero_density :
    HasZeroDensity {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 2^k}

/-- For powers of 2, the sumset 2^a + 2^b has roughly 3/2 times as many
    elements as the original set in each "level".

    Specifically: up to 2^n, the set {2^k : k ≤ n} has n elements,
    and {2^a + 2^b : a, b ≤ n} has about 3n/2 elements (pairs with a < b
    plus pairs with a = b, minus overlaps).

    This shows the constant 3 is asymptotically optimal. -/
def powersOfTwo : Set ℕ := {n : ℕ | ∃ k, n = 2^k}

/-- The sumset of powers of 2 includes:
    - All 2^k (when a = b)
    - All 2^a + 2^b for a ≠ b (these are distinct binary expansions)

    Up to N = 2^n: A has n elements, A+A has approximately n + n(n-1)/2 = n(n+1)/2 elements.
    The ratio approaches infinity, but the relevant comparison is at matching scales. -/
