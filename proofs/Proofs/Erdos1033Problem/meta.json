  "overview": "Let h(n) be such that every graph on n vertices with > n²/4 edges contains a triangle whose vertices have degrees summing to at least h(n). Estimate h(n). Is h(n) ≥ (2(√3−1)−o(1))n?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - Upper bound h(n) ≤ 2(√3−1)n ≈ 1.464n (Erdős-Laskar 1985). Lower bound h(n) ≥ (21/16)n = 1.3125n (Fan 1988). Gap of ~0.15n between bounds remains unsolved.",
