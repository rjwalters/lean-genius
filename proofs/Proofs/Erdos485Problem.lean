  Let $f(k)$ be the minimum number of terms in $P(x)^2$, where $P\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ ranges over all polynomials with exactly $k$ non-zero terms. Is it true that $f(k)\to\infty$ as $k\to \infty$?
  
  
  
  This is Problem 4.4 in \cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s.
  
  First investigated by R\'{e}nyi and R\'{e}dei \cite{Re47}. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er49b} proved that $f(k)<k^{1-c}$ for some $c>0$...
