  Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ be such that\[2f(x) \leq f(x+h)+f(x+2h)\]for every $x\in \mathbb{R}$ and $h>0$. Must $f$ be monotonic?
  
  
  
  A problem of Kemperman \cite{Ke69}, who proved it is true if $f$ is measurable. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er81b} wrote 'if it were my problem I would offer \$500 for it'.
  
  This was solved by Laczkovich \cite{La84}.
