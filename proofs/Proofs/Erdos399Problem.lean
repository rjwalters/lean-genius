  Is it true that there are no solutions to\[n! = x^k\pm y^k\]with $x,y,n\in \mathbb{N}$, with $xy>1$ and $k>2$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Obl\'{a}th \cite{ErOb37} proved this is true when $(x,y)=1$ and $k\neq 4$. Pollack and Shapiro \cite{PoSh73} proved there are no solutions to $n!=x^4-1$. The known methods break down without the condition $(x,y)=1$.
  
  Jonas Barfield has found the solution\[10! = 48^...
