  Call a sequence $1<X_1\leq\cdots X_m\leq n$ line-compatible if there is a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that there are $m$ lines $\ell_1,\ldots,\ell_m$ containing at least two points, and the number of points on $\ell_i$ is exactly $X_i$.
  
  Prove that there are at most\[\exp(O(n^{1/2}))\]many line-compatible sequences.
  
  
  
  This problem is essentially the same as [607], but with mul...
