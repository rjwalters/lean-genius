  Every connected graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into at most $\lceil n/2\rceil$ edge-disjoint paths.
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Gallai. Lov\'{a}sz \cite{Lo68} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices can be partitioned into at most $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ edge-disjoint paths and cycles, which implies that every graph can be partitioned into at most $n-1$ paths.
