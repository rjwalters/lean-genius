  Let $F(N)$ be the maximal size of $A\subseteq\{1,\ldots,N\}$ such that no $a\in A$ divides the sum of any distinct elements of $A\backslash\{a\}$. Estimate $F(N)$. In particular, is it true that\[F(N) > N^{1/2-o(1)}?\]
  
  
  
  This was studied by Erd\H{o}s, Lev, Rauzy, S\'{a}ndor, and S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy \cite{ELRSS99}, where they call such a property 'non-dividing', and prove the explicit bound\[F(N)<3...
