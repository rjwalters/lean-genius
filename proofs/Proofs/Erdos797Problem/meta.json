  "overview": "Let f(d) be the maximal acyclic chromatic number of any graph with maximum degree d. An acyclic coloring requires no edge between same-colored vertices and no bichromatic cycles. The question asks: Is f(d) = o(d²)?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - f(d) = Θ(d^{4/3}). Alon-McDiarmid-Reed (1991) proved f(d) ≤ O(d^{4/3}). The lower bound is Ω(d^{4/3}/(log d)^{1/3}). The exponent 4/3 arises from balancing constraints on bichromatic 4-cycles.",
