  Statement:
  Let $B\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ be an additive basis of order $k$ with $0\in B$. Is it true that for every $A\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ we have\[d_s(A+B)\geq \alpha+\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{k},\]where $\alpha=d_s(A)$ and\[d_s(A) = \inf \frac{\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N}\]is the Schnirelmann density? Erdős [Er36c] proved this is true with $k$ replaced by $2k$ in the denominator (in a stronger form that only considers $A\cup (A+b)$ for some $b\in B$, see [38]). Ruzsa has observed that this follows ...
