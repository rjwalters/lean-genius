  Is there some function $f(r)$ such that $f(r)\to \infty$ as $r\to\infty$, such that, for infinitely many $n$, there exist $a_1,a_2$ with\[a_1+a_2> n+f(r)\log n\]such that $a_1!a_2! \mid n!2^n3^n\cdots p_r^n$?
  
  
  
  It is ambiguous in \cite{ErGr80} what the intended quantifiers are on the variables (they write 'is it true that we can find $a_1+a_2>n+f(r)\log n$...'). Comparing to previous problems ...
