  For any $n$ let $F(n)$ be the largest $k$ such that any of the $k!$ possible ordering patterns appears in some sequence of $\phi(m+1),\ldots,\phi(m+k)$ with $m+k\leq n$. Is it true that\[F(n)=(c+o(1))\log\log\log n\]for some constant $c$? Is the first pattern which fails to appear always\[\phi(m+1)>\phi(m+2)>\cdots \phi(m+k)?\]Is it true that 'natural' ordering which mimics what happens to $\phi(1),\ld...
