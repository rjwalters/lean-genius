  If $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ is a finite set then let $G(A)$ denote the greatest integer which is not expressible as a finite sum of elements from $A$ (with repetitions allowed). Let\[g(k,n)=\max G(A)\]where the maximum is taken over all $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ of size $\lvert A\rvert=k$ which has no common divisor. Is it true that\[g(k,n)\sim \frac{n^2}{k-1}?\]
