  Let $a_n$ be a sequence of integers such that for every bounded sequence of integers $b_n$ (with $a_n+b_n\neq 0$ and $b_n\neq 0$ for all $n$) the sum\[\sum \frac{1}{a_n+b_n}\]is irrational. Are $a_n=2^n$ or $a_n=n!$ examples of such a sequence?
  
  
  
  A possible definition of an 'irrationality sequence' (see also [262] and [263]). One example is $a_n=2^{2^n}$. In \cite{ErGr80} they also ask whether...
