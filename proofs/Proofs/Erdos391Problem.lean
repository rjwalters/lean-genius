  Let $t(n)$ be maximal such that there is a representation\[n!=a_1\cdots a_n\]with $t(n)=a_1\leq \cdots \leq a_n$. Obtain good bounds for $t(n)/n$. In particular, is it true that\[\lim \frac{t(n)}{n}=\frac{1}{e}?\]Furthermore, does there exist some constant $c>0$ such that\[\frac{t(n)}{n} \leq \frac{1}{e}-\frac{c}{\log n}\]for infinitely many $n$?
  
  
  
  It is easy to see that\[\lim \frac{t(n)}{n}\l...
