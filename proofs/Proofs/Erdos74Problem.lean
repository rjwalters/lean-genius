  Let $f(n)\to \infty$ (possibly very slowly). Is there a graph of infinite chromatic number such that every finite subgraph on $n$ vertices can be made bipartite by deleting at most $f(n)$ edges?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{EHS82}.
  
  R\"{o}dl \cite{Ro82} has proved this for hypergraphs, and also proved there is such a graph (with chromatic number $\aleph_0$) i...
