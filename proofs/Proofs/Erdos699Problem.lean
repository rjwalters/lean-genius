  Is it true that for every $1\leq i<j\leq n/2$ there exists some prime $p\geq i$ such that\[p\mid \textrm{gcd}\left(\binom{n}{i}, \binom{n}{j}\right)?\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres. A theorem of Sylvester and Schur says that for any $1\leq i\leq n/2$ there exists some prime $p>i$ which divides $\binom{n}{i}$.
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres further conjectured that $p\geq i$ can be improv...
