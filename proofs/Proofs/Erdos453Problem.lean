  Is it true that, for all sufficiently large $n$, there exists some $i<n$ such that\[p_n^2 < p_{n+i}p_{n-i},\]where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Straus. Selfridge conjectured the answer is no, contrary to Erd\H{o}s and Straus. The answer is no, as shown by Pomerance \cite{Po79}, who proved there are infinitely many $n$ such that\[p_n^2 > p_{n+i}p_{n-i}\]for all $i<n$. Pome...
