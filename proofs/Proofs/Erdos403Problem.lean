  Does the equation\[2^m=a_1!+\cdots+a_k!\]with $a_1<a_2<\cdots <a_k$ have only finitely many solutions?
  
  
  
  Asked by Burr and Erd\H{o}s. Frankl and Lin \cite{Li76} independently showed that the answer is yes, and the largest solution is\[2^7=2!+3!+5!.\]In fact Lin showed that the largest power of $2$ which can divide a sum of distinct factorials containing $2$ is $2^{254}$, and that there are onl...
