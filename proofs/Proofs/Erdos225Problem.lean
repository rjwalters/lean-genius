  Let\[ f(\theta) = \sum_{0\leq k\leq n}c_k e^{ik\theta}\]be a trigonometric polynomial all of whose roots are real, such that $\max_{\theta\in [0,2\pi]}\lvert f(\theta)\rvert=1$. Then\[\int_0^{2\pi}\lvert f(\theta)\rvert \mathrm{d}\theta \leq 4.\]
  
  
  
  This is Problem 4.20 in \cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s.
  
  This was solved independently by Kristiansen \cite{Kr74} (only in th...
