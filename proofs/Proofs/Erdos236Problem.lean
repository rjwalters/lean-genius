  Let $f(n)$ count the number of solutions to $n=p+2^k$ for prime $p$ and $k\geq 0$. Is it true that $f(n)=o(\log n)$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er50} proved that there are infinitely many $n$ such that $f(n)\gg \log\log n$.
  
  Erd\H{o}s could not even prove that there do not exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that for all $1< 2^k<n$ the number $n-2^k$ is prime - he conjectured (see problem A19 o...
