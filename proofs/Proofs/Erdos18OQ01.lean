  Erdős Problem #18 — OQ-01: representability algebra and verified practical numbers

  Erdős Problem #18 (OPEN, $250) studies *practical numbers*: `m` is practical if
  every `1 ≤ k < m` is a sum of distinct divisors of `m`.  The gallery parent
  `Erdos18Problem` sets up `IsRepresentable`, `IsPractical`, and the function
  `h(m)`, and verifies that `1` and `2` are practical.  The open questions concern
  the asymptotic size of `h(m)` (Mertens/Vose-type bounds), out of elementary
  reach.  This file fills in the elementary groundwork the parent omits:

  * the **representability algebra** — `0`, every divisor, `1`, and `m` itself are
    representable (`zero_representable`, `mem_divisors_representable`,
    `one_representable`, `self_representable`);
  * a **decidable bridge** `practical_of_check` turning `IsPractical m` into a
    finite check over `(divisors m).powerset`, and the verified practical numbers
    `4`, `6`, `8` (extending the parent's `1`, `2` along OEIS A005153).

  All results are fully machine-checked (0 axioms, 0 sorries).
