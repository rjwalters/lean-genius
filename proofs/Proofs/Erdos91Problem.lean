  Suppose $A\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ has $\lvert A\rvert=n$ and minimises the number of distinct distances between points in $A$. Prove that for large $n$ there are at least two (and probably many) such $A$ which are non-similar.
  
  
  
  For $n=3$ the equilateral triangle is the only such set. For $n=4$ the square or two equilateral triangles sharing an edge give two non-similar examples.
  
  For $n=5$ ...
