  Let $k\geq 2$. Is it true that, for any distinct integers $1<n_1<\cdots <n_k$ such that\[1=\frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k}\]we must have $\max(n_{i+1}-n_i)\geq 3$?
  
  
  
  The example $1=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}$ shows that $3$ would be best possible here. The lower bound of $\geq 2$ is equivalent to saying that $1$ is not the sum of reciprocals of consecutive integers, proved by Erd\H...
