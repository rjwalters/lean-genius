  Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that there exists a set $A$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ in which every $x\in A$ has at least $f(n)$ points in $A$ equidistant from $x$.
  
  Is it true that $f(n)\leq n^{o(1)}$? Or even $f(n) < n^{O(1/\log\log n)}$?
  
  
  
  This is a stronger form of the unit distance conjecture (see [90]).
  
  The set of lattice points imply $f(n) > n^{c/\log\log n}$ for some constan...
