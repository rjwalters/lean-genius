  Let $f(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Is it true that\[\sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{1}{(n+1)\cdots (n+f(n))}\]is irrational?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham write 'the answer is almost surely in the affirmative if $f(n)$ is assumed to be nondecreasing'. Even the case $f(n)=n$ is unknown, although Hansen \cite{Ha75} has shown that\[\sum_n \frac{1}{\binom{2n}{n}}=\sum_n \frac{n!}{(n+1)\cdots (n+n)}=\frac{1}{3}+...
