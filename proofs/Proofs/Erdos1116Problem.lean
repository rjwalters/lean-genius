  For a meromorphic function $f$ let $n(r,a)$ count the number of roots of $f(z)=a$ in the disc $\lvert z\rvert <r$. Does there exist a meromorphic (or entire) $f$ such that for every $a\neq b$\[\limsup_{r\to \infty}\frac{n(r,a)}{n(r,b)}=\infty?\]
  
  
  
  This is Problem 1.25 in \cite{Ha74}, where it is attributed to Erd\H{o}s.
