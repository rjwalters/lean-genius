  Does there exist an absolute constant $c>0$ such that, for all $r\geq 2$, in any $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $3$ there is a vertex contained in at least $(1+c)^r$ many edges?
  
  
  
  In general, determine the largest integer $f(r)$ such that every $r$-uniform hypergraph with chromatic number $3$ has a vertex contained in at least $f(r)$ many edges. It is easy to see that $f(2)=2$ an...
