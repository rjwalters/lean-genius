  What is the largest possible subset $A\subseteq\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which contains $N$ such that $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b)>1$ for all $a\neq b\in A$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Graham (in \cite{Er73} it was stated with $(a,b)=1$ instead but this is clearly a typo). They conjecture that this maximum is either $N/p$ (where $p$ is the smallest prime factor of $N$) or it is the number of integers $\{2t: t\l...
