  Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain a trivial (empty or complete) graph on more than $c\log n$ vertices. Must $G$ contain at least $2^{\Omega_c(n)}$ many induced subgraphs which are not pairwise isomorphic?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi. Alon and Hajnal \cite{AlHa91} proved that $G$ must contain at least\[\exp\left(n(\log n)^{-O(\log\log n)}\right)\]many non-iso...
