  How large is the largest prime factor of $n(n+1)$?
  
  
  
  Let $F(n)$ be the prime in question. P\'{o}lya \cite{Po18} proved that $F(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$. Mahler \cite{Ma35} showed that $F(n)\gg \log\log n$. Schinzel \cite{Sc67b} observed that for infinitely many $n$ we have $F(n)\leq n^{O(1/\log\log\log n)}$.
  
  The truth is probably $F(n)\gg (\log n)^2$ for all $n$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er76...
