  Is there some $c>0$ such that, for all sufficiently large $n$, there exist integers $a_1<\cdots<a_k\leq n$ such that there are at least $cn^2$ distinct integers of the form $\sum_{u\leq i\leq v}a_i$?
  
  
  
  This fails for $a_i=i$ for example. Erd\H{o}s and Graham also ask what happens if we drop the monotonicity restriction and just ask that the $a_i$ are distinct. They speculated that perhaps some...
