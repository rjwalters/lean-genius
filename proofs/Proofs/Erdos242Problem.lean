  For every $n>2$ there exist distinct integers $1\leq x<y<z$ such that\[\frac{4}{n} = \frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{z}.\]
  
  
  
  The Erd\H{os-Straus conjecture}. The existence of a representation of $4/n$ as the sum of at most four distinct unit fractions follows trivially from a greedy algorithm.
  
  Schinzel conjectured the generalisation that, for any fixed $a$, if $n$ is sufficiently large i...
