  Let $\epsilon,\delta>0$ and $n$ be sufficiently large in terms of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. Let $G$ be a triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $<n^{1/2-\epsilon}$.
  
  Can $G$ be made into a triangle-free graph with diameter $2$ by adding at most $\delta n^2$ edges?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, who proved that this is the case when $G$ has maximum degree $\ll \lo...
