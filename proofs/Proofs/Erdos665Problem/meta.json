  "overview": "A pairwise balanced design for {1,...,n} is a collection of blocks where every pair of elements appears in exactly one block. The question asks: Does there exist a constant C such that for all large n, a design exists with all block sizes > √n - C?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - The function h(n) measuring the minimum gap from √n satisfies h(n) ≪ n^{1/2-c} unconditionally, and h(n) ≪ (log n)² under Cramér's conjecture. The answer is 'no' if projective planes exist only for prime power orders. Deep connections to projective plane existence and prime gaps.",
