  A set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ is primitive if no member of $A$ divides another. Is the sum\[\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n\log n}\]maximised over all primitive sets when $A$ is the set of primes?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er35} proved that this sum always converges for a primitive set. Lichtman \cite{Li23} proved that the answer is yes.
