  The number of equilateral triangles of size $1$ formed by any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^6$ is at most $(\frac{1}{27}+o(1))n^3$.
  
  
  
  Let $T_6^u(n)$ count the maximal number of equilateral triangles of size $1$ formed by $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^6$. The following construction (which \cite{Er94b} attributes to Lenz, but appears in an earlier paper of Erd\H{o}s and Purdy \cite{ErPu75}) shows...
