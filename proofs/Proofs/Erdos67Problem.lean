  If $f:\mathbb{N}\to \{-1,+1\}$ then is it true that for every $C>0$ there exist $d,m\geq 1$ such that\[\left\lvert \sum_{1\leq k\leq m}f(kd)\right\rvert > C?\]
  
  
  
  The Erd\H{o}s discrepancy problem. This is true, and was proved by Tao \cite{Ta16}, who also proved the more general case when $f$ takes values on the unit sphere.
  
  In several places (e.g. \cite{Er64b}, \cite{Er65b}, and \cite{Er8...
