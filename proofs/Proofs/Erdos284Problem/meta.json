  "overview": "Let f(k) = max{n₁ : 1 = 1/n₁ + ... + 1/nₖ with distinct denominators}. Is f(k) = (1+o(1))·k/(e-1)?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - Croot (2001) proved f(k) ~ k/(e-1). Upper bound is trivial from harmonic series. Lower bound: for any N > 1, there exist distinct n₁ < ... < nₖ in (N, eN] with Σ1/nᵢ = 1.",
