  Let $d\geq 3$, and let $f_d(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that every set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ determines at least $m$ distinct distances. Estimate $f_d(n)$ - in particular, is it true that\[f_d(n)=n^{\frac{2}{d}-o(1)}?\]
  
  
  
  A generalisation of the distinct distance problem [89] to higher dimensions. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er46b} proved\[n^{1/d}\ll_d f_d(n)\ll_d n^{2/d},\]the upper bound const...
