  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Let $A$ be the set of all odd integers not of the form $p+2^{k}+2^l$ (where $k,l\geq 0$ and $p$ is prime). Is the upper density of $A$ positive? In [Er77c] Erdős credits Schinzel with proving that there are infinitely many odd integers not of this form, but gives no reference. Crocker [Cr71] has proved there are $\gg\log\log N$ such integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$. Pan [Pa11] improved this to $\gg_\epsilon N^{1-\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon>0$. Erdős believed this cannot be proved by covering sys...
