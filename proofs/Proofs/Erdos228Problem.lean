  Does there exist, for all large $n$, a polynomial $P$ of degree $n$, with coefficients $\pm 1$, such that\[\sqrt{n} \ll \lvert P(z) \rvert \ll \sqrt{n}\]for all $\lvert z\rvert =1$, with the implied constants independent of $z$ and $n$?
  
  
  
  Originally a conjecture of Littlewood. The answer is yes (for all $n\geq 2$), proved by Balister, Bollob\'{a}s, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba \cite{BBMST20}...
