  Let $Q_n$ be the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph (so that $Q_n$ has $2^n$ vertices and $n2^{n-1}$ edges). Is it true that every subgraph of $Q_n$ with\[\geq \left(\frac{1}{2}+o(1)\right)n2^{n-1}\]many edges contains a $C_4$?
  
  
  
  Let $f(n)$ be the maximum number of edges in a subgraph of $Q_n$ without a $C_4$, so that this conjecture is that $f(n)\leq (\frac{1}{2}+o(1))n2^{n-1}$.
