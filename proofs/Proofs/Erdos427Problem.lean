  Is it true that, for every $n$ and $d$, there exists $k$ such that\[d \mid p_{n+1}+\cdots+p_{n+k},\]where $p_r$ denotes the $r$th prime?
  
  
  
  Cedric Pilatte has observed that a positive solution to this follows from a result of Shiu \cite{Sh00}: for any $k\geq 1$ and $(a,q)=1$ there exist infinitely many $k$-tuples of consecutive primes $p_m,\ldots,p_{m+{k-1}}$ all of which are congruent to $a$ m...
