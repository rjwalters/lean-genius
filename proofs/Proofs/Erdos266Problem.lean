  Let $a_n$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $\sum \frac{1}{a_n}$ converges. There exists some integer $t\geq 1$ such that\[\sum \frac{1}{a_n+t}\]is irrational.
  
  
  
  This conjecture is due to Stolarsky.
  
  A negative answer was proved by Kova\v{c} and Tao \cite{KoTa24}, who proved even more: there exists a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers $a_n$ such that\[\s...
