  "overview": "Let A ⊂ {1,...,N} be a Sidon set (all pairwise sums distinct) with |A| ~ √N. Must A+A be well-distributed over small moduli? In particular, must about half of A+A be even and half odd? Lindström (1998) showed A itself is well-distributed, Kolountzakis (1999) strengthened this, and the result for A+A follows from the Sidon property.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - A+A is well-distributed over small moduli for maximal Sidon sets. The unique representation property of Sidon sets (each sum a+b has a unique representation) propagates distribution properties from A to A+A. About half the sums are even, half odd.",
