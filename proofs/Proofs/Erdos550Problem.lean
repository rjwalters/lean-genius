  Erdős Problem #550

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/550
  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Let $m_1\leq\cdots\leq m_k$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. If $T$ is a tree on $n$ vertices and $G$ is the complete multipartite graph with vertex class sizes $m_1,\ldots,m_k$ then prove that\[R(T,G)\leq (\chi(G)-1)(R(T,K_{m_1,m_2})-1)+m_1.\] Chvátal [Ch77] proved that $R(T,K_m)=(m-1)(n-1)+1$. This problem is #16 in Ramsey Theory in the graphs problem collection. View the LaTeX source
