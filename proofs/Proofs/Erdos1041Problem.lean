  Let $f(z)=\prod_{i=1}^n(z-z_i)\in \mathbb{C}[z]$ with $\lvert z_i\rvert < 1$ for all $i$.
  
  Must there always exist a path of length less than $2$ in\[\{z: \lvert f(z)\rvert < 1\}\]which connects two of the roots of $f$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Herzog, and Piranian \cite{EHP58}, who proved that this set always has a connected component containing at least two of the roots.
