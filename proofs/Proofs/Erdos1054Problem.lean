  Let $f(n)$ be the minimal integer $m$ such that $n$ is the sum of the $k$ smallest divisors of $m$ for some $k\geq 1$.
  
  Is it true that $f(n)=o(n)$? Or is this true only for almost all $n$, and $\limsup f(n)/n=\infty$?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s reported in problem B2 of Guy's collection \cite{Gu04}. The function $f(n)$ is undefined for $n=2$ and $n=5$, but is likely well-defined for all $n...
