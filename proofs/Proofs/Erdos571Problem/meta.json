  "overview": "Show that for any rational α ∈ [1,2) there exists a bipartite graph G such that ex(n;G) ≍ n^α. A rational with this property is called a 'Turán exponent'.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "OPEN - Many specific Turán exponents are known: 3/2-1/(2s), 4/3-1/(3s), 5/4-1/(4s), 2-a/b with various conditions (Conlon-Janzer-Lee, Jiang-Qiu, etc.). Bukh-Conlon (2018) proved the weaker version for finite families. The single graph case remains open, especially for exponents near 1.",
