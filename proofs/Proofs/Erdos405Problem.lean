  Let $p$ be an odd prime. Is it true that the equation\[(p-1)!+a^{p-1}=p^k\]has only finitely many solutions?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham remark that it is probably true that in general $(p-1)!+a^{p-1}$ is rarely a power at all (although this can happen, for example $6!+2^6=28^2$).
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham ask this allowing the case $p=2$, but this is presumably an oversight, since clearly there ar...
