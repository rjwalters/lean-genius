  Let $t(n)$ be the minimum number of points in $\{1,\ldots,n\}^2$ such that the $\binom{t}{2}$ lines determined by these points cover all points in $\{1,\ldots,n\}^2$.
  
  Estimate $t(n)$. In particular, is it true that $t(n)=o(n)$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Purdy, who proved $t(n) \gg n^{2/3}$.
  
  Resolved by Alon \cite{Al91} who proved $t(n) \ll n^{2/3}\log n$.
