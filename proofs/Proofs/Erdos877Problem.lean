  Let $f_m(n)$ count the number of maximal sum-free subsets $A\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}$ - that is, there are no solutions to $a=b+c$ in $A$ and $A$ is maximal with this property. Estimate $f(n)$ - is it true that $f_m(n)=o(2^{n/2})$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Cameron and Erd\H{o}s, who proved that $f_m(n)>2^{n/4}$, and also asked whether\[f_m(n)=o(f(n)),\]where $f(n)$ counts the number of all (not necessari...
