  Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n\in \mathbb{R}^3$ be the vertices of a convex polyhedron. Are there at least\[(1-o(1))\frac{n}{2}\]many distinct distances between the $x_i$?
  
  
  
  For the similar problem in $\mathbb{R}^2$ there are always at least $n/2$ distances, as proved by Altman \cite{Al63} (see [93]). In \cite{Er75f} Erd\H{o}s claims that Altman proved that the vertices determine $\gg n$ many distinct di...
