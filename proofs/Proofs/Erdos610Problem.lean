  Statement:
  For a graph G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG let &#x03C4;(G)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">τ(G)τ(G)\tau(G) denote the minimal number of vertices that include at least one from each maximal clique of G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG (sometimes called the clique transversal number). Estimate &#x03C4;(G)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">τ(G)τ(G)\tau(G). In particular, is it true that if G" role="presentation" style="p...
