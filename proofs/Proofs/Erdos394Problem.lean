  Let $t_k(n)$ denote the least $m$ such that\[n\mid m(m+1)(m+2)\cdots (m+k-1).\]Is it true that\[\sum_{n\leq x}t_2(n)\ll \frac{x^2}{(\log x)^c}\]for some $c>0$?
  
  Is it true that, for $k\geq 2$,\[\sum_{n\leq x}t_{k+1}(n) =o\left(\sum_{n\leq x}t_k(n)\right)?\]
  
  
  
  In \cite{ErGr80} they mention a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s that the sum is $o(x^2)$. This was proved by Erd\H{o}s and Hall \cite{ErHa78...
