  Let $f(n)$ be maximal such that any $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, with no three on a line, determine at least $f(n)$ different convex subsets. Estimate $f(n)$ - in particular, does there exist a constant $c$ such that\[\lim \frac{\log f(n)}{(\log n)^2}=c?\]
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s and Hammer. Erd\H{o}s proved in \cite{Er78c} that there exist constants $c_1,c_2>0$ such that\[n^{c_1\log n}<f(n...
