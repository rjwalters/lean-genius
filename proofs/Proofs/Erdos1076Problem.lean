  Let $k\geq 5$ and let $\mathcal{F}_k$ be the family of all $3$-uniform hypergraphs with $k$ vertices and $k-2$ edges. Is it true that\[\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\mathcal{F}_k)\sim \frac{n^2}{6}?\]
  
  
  
  A question of Brown, Erd\H{o}s, and S\'{o}s \cite{BES73} who proved this is true for $k=4$, and that for all $k\geq 4$\[\mathrm{ex}_3(n,\mathcal{F}_k)\asymp_k n^2.\]In \cite{Er74c} Erd\H{o}s writes 'the only...
