  If $\mathbb{N}$ is 2-coloured then is there some infinite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that all finite subset sums\[ \sum_{n\in S}n\](as $S$ ranges over all non-empty finite subsets of $A$) are monochromatic?
  
  
  
  In other words, must some colour class be an IP set. Asked by Graham and Rothschild. See also [531].
  
  Proved by Hindman \cite{Hi74} (for any number of colours).
