  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that for all large $N$\[\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \gg N^{1/2}\]and\[\lvert B\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \gg N^{1/2}.\]Is it true that there are infinitely many solutions to $a_1-a_2=b_1-b_2\neq 0$ with $a_1,a_2\in A$ and $b_1,b_2\in B$?
  
  
  
  Ruzsa has observed that there is a simple counterexample: take $A$ to be the set of numbers whose binary representat...
