  Let $n_1<n_2<\cdots$ be the sequence of integers which are the sum of two squares. Explore the behaviour of (i.e. find good upper and lower bounds for) the consecutive differences $n_{k+1}-n_k$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er51} proved that, for infinitely many $k$,\[ n_{k+1}-n_k \gg \frac{\log n_k}{\sqrt{\log\log n_k}}.\]Richards \cite{Ri82} improved this to\[\limsup_{k\to \infty} \frac{n_{k+1}-n_k}{\l...
