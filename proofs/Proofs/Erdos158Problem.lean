  Let $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ be an infinite set such that, for any $n$, there are most $2$ solutions to $a+b=n$ with $a\leq b$. Must\[\liminf_{N\to\infty}\frac{\lvert A\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert}{N^{1/2}}=0?\]
  
  
  
  If we replace $2$ by $1$ then $A$ is a Sidon set, for which Erd\H{o}s proved this is true.
