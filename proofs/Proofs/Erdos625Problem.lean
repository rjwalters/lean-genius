  Statement:
  The cochromatic number of G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG, denoted by &#x03B6;(G)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">ζ(G)ζ(G)\zeta(G), is the minimum number of colours needed to colour the vertices of G" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">GGG such that each colour class induces either a complete graph or empty graph. Let &#x03C7;(G)" role="presentation" style="position: relative;">χ(G)χ(G)\chi(G) denote the chromatic number. If G" role="presen...
