  Is it true that, for every $k\geq 3$, there is a constant $c_k>0$ such that\[\mathrm{ex}(n,G_k) \ll n^{3/2-c_k},\]where $G_k$ is the bipartite graph between $\{y_1,\ldots,y_k\}$ and $\{z_1,\ldots,z_{\binom{k}{2}}\}$, with each $z_j$ joined to a unique pair of $y_i$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits, who proved (in unpublished work) that in such a result one must have $c_k\to 0$ as $k...
