  Let $1\leq k<\ell$ be integers and define $F_k(N,\ell)$ to be minimal such that every set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ of size $N$ which contains at least $F_k(N,\ell)$ many $k$-term arithmetic progressions must contain an $\ell$-term arithmetic progression. Find good upper bounds for $F_k(N,\ell)$. Is it true that\[F_3(N,4)=o(N^2)?\]Is it true that for every $\ell>3$\[\lim_{N\to \infty}\frac{\log F_3(N,\ell)...
