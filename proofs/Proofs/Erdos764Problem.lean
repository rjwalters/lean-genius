  Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$. Can there exist some constant $c>0$ such that\[\sum_{n\leq N} 1_A\ast 1_A\ast 1_A(n) = cN+O(1)?\]
  
  
  
  The case of $1_A\ast 1_A(n)$ is the subject of [763].
  
  The answer is no, proved in a strong form by Vaughan \cite{Va72}, who showed that in fact\[\sum_{n\leq N} 1_A\ast 1_A\ast 1_A(n) = cN+o\left(\frac{N^{1/4}}{(\log N)^{1/2}}\right)\]is impossible. Vaughan prove...
