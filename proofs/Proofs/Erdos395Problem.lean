  If $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert z_i\rvert=1$ then is it true that the probability that\[\lvert \epsilon_1z_1+\cdots+\epsilon_nz_n\rvert \leq \sqrt{2},\]where $\epsilon_i\in \{-1,1\}$ uniformly at random, is $\gg 1/n$?
  
  
  
  A reverse Littlewood-Offord problem. Erd\H{o}s originally asked this with $\sqrt{2}$ replaced by $1$, but Carnielli and Carolino \cite{CaCa11} observed that this...
