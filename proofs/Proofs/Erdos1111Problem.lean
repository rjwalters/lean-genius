  If $G$ is a finite graph and $A,B$ are disjoint sets of vertices then we call $A,B$ anticomplete if there are no edges between $A$ and $B$.
  
  If $t,c\geq 1$ then there exists $d\geq 1$ such that if $\chi(G)\geq d$ and $\omega(G)<t$ then there are anticomplete sets $A,B$ with $\chi(A)\geq \chi(B)\geq c$.
