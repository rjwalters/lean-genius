  Let $\delta(n)$ denote the density of integers which are divisible by some integer in $(n,2n)$. What is the growth rate of $\delta(n)$?
  
  If $\delta_1(n)$ is the density of integers which have exactly one divisor in $(n,2n)$ then is it true that $\delta_1(n)=o(\delta(n))$?
  
  
  
  Besicovitch \cite{Be34} proved that $\liminf \delta(n)=0$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er35} proved that $\delta(n)=o(1)$. Erd\H{...
