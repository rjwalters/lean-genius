  Erdős Problem #859: Density of Divisor Sum Representations

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/859
  Status: PARTIALLY SOLVED (bounds known, asymptotics open)

  Statement:
  Let t ≥ 1 and let dₜ be the density of the set of integers n ∈ ℕ for which
  t can be represented as the sum of distinct divisors of n.

  Do there exist constants c₁, c₂ > 0 such that
      dₜ ~ c₁ / (log t)^c₂
  as t → ∞?

  Known Results (Erdős 1970):
  - The density dₜ always exists
  - There exist constants c₃, c₄ > 0 such that
      1/(log t)^c₃ < dₜ < 1/(log t)^c₄

  The open question asks whether dₜ has a precise asymptotic form.

  Examples:
  - t = 0: Every n works (empty sum), so d₀ = 1
  - t = 1: Need 1 | n, which is all n, so d₁ = 1
  - t = 2: Need 2 | n, so d₂ = 1/2
  - t = 3: Need 1 + 2 | n or 3 | n, which is n ≡ 0 (mod 3) or n ≡ 0 (mod 2)

/- ## Part IV: Erdős's Bounds (1970) -/

/-- **Erdős (1970)**: The density dₜ exists for all t.

    This is nontrivial: not all sets have natural density.
    The proof uses multiplicative structure of divisor sums. -/
axiom erdos_density_exists (t : ℕ) :
    ∃ d : ℝ, HasNaturalDensity (DivisorSumSet t) d

/-- **Erdős (1970)**: The density is always positive.

    Intuition: For any t, there are infinitely many n with t | σ(n)
    where σ(n) is the sum of all divisors. Finding n where t is a
    subset sum is related but requires more care. -/

/-- **Erdős (1970)**: Upper and lower bounds of the same form.

    There exist c₃, c₄ > 0 such that for large t:
        1/(log t)^c₃ < dₜ < 1/(log t)^c₄

    This shows dₜ decays polynomially in log t. -/

    Do there exist constants c₁, c₂ > 0 such that
        dₜ ~ c₁ / (log t)^c₂
    as t → ∞?

/-- Practical numbers have positive density (Margenstern 1991).
    This relates to our problem since practical n contribute to many dₜ. -/
/- ## Part X: Subset Sum Problem -/

/-- The subset sum problem: given a set S and target t, does some
    subset of S sum to t? This is NP-complete in general, but
    for divisor sets, special structure helps. -/
def SubsetSumExists (S : Finset ℕ) (t : ℕ) : Prop :=

/- ## Part XI: Growth of σ(n) -/

/-- Average order of σ(n): Σ_{n≤N} σ(n) ~ (π²/12) N². -/
/-- For "most" n, σ(n) ≈ n · (some logarithmic factor).
    This bounds how many n can contribute to DivisorSumSet t for large t. -/

## Summary

This file formalizes Erdős Problem #859 on the density of divisor sum
representations.

**Status**: PARTIALLY SOLVED (bounds known) / OPEN (precise asymptotics)

**The Problem**: For which n can t be written as a sum of distinct
divisors of n? What is the density dₜ of such n, and does it have
a precise asymptotic form c₁/(log t)^c₂?

**What we formalize**:
1. DivisorSumSet t: the set of n where t is a divisor subset sum
2. Natural density definition
3. Basic examples (t = 0, 1, 2)
4. Erdős's bounds from 1970
5. The open question about precise asymptotics
6. Connection to practical numbers
7. Subset sum perspective

**Key insight**: The density dₜ decays like a power of log t, but
the precise power and coefficient are unknown. The problem connects
divisibility theory with combinatorics (subset sums) and density.

**Historical Note**: This problem is part of Erdős's extensive work
on the structure of divisors. The 1970 paper established the basic
bounds, but the precise asymptotics remain elusive.
