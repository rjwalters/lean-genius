  Let $k\geq 0$. Let $f(k)$ be such that every graph on $n\geq f(k)$ vertices with at least $\binom{n-k-1}{2}+\binom{k+2}{2}+1$ edges contains a cycle on $n-k$ vertices. Determine or estimate $f(k)$.
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er62e} proved that $f(k)$ exists for all $k\geq 0$; this is not immediately stated in \cite{Er62e}, but Cambie has in the comments explained why the existence of $f(k)$ follows fro...
