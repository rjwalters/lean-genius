  Let $A=\{a_1<a_2<\cdots\}\subset \mathbb{N}$ be an infinite sum-free set - that is, there are no solutions to\[a=b_1+\cdots+b_r\]with $b_1<\cdots<b_r<a\in A$. How small can $a_{n+1}-a_n$ be? Is it possible that $a_{n+1}-a_n<n$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er98} writes that Graham 'recently proved' that there is such a sequence for which $a_{n+1}-a_n<n^{1+o(1)}$, and that Melfi proved a somewhat weaker r...
