  Is it true that the number of graphs on $n$ vertices which do not contain $G$ is\[\leq 2^{(1+o(1))\mathrm{ex}(n;G)}?\]
  
  
  
  If $G$ is not bipartite the answer is yes, proved by Erd\H{o}s, Frankl, and R\"{o}dl \cite{EFR86}. The answer is no for $G=C_6$, the cycle on 6 vertices. Morris and Saxton \cite{MoSa16} have proved there are at least\[2^{(1+c)\mathrm{ex}(n;C_6)}\]such graphs for infinitely m...
