  Is it true that in any $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ there must exist at least\[(1+o(1))\frac{n^2}{12}\]many edge-disjoint monochromatic triangles?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Faudreee, and Ordman. This would be best possible, as witnessed by dividing the vertices of $K_n$ into two equal parts and colouring all edges between the parts red and all edges inside the parts blue.
