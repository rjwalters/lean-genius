  Is it true that, for every prime $p$, there is a prime $q<p$ which is a primitive root modulo $p$?
  
  
  
  Artin conjectured that $2$ is a primitive root for infinitely many primes $p$, which Hooley \cite{Ho67b} proved assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis. Heath-Brown \cite{He86b} proved that at least one of $2$, $3$, or $5$ is a primitive root for infinitely many primes $p$.
