  Statement:
  Let $f(n)$ be minimal such that there is an intersecting family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets of size $n$ (so $A\cap B\neq\emptyset$ for all $A,B\in \mathcal{F}$) with $\lvert \mathcal{F}\rvert=f(n)$ such that any set $S$ with $\lvert S\rvert \leq n-1$ is disjoint from at least one $A\in \mathcal{F}$. Is it true that\[f(n) \ll n?\] Conjectured by Erdős and Lovász [ErLo75], who proved that\[\frac{8}{3}n-3\leq f(n) \ll n^{3/2}\log n\]for all $n$. The upper bound was improved by Kahn [Ka92b] to\[f(n) \l...
