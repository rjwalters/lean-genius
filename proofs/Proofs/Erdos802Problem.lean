  Is it true that any $K_r$-free graph on $n$ vertices with average degree $t$ contains an independent set on\[\gg_r \frac{\log t}{t}n\]many vertices?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Ajtai, Erd\H{o}s, Koml\'{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{AEKS81}, who proved that there must exist an independent set on\[\gg_r \frac{\log\log(t+1)}{t}n\]many vertices. Shearer \cite{Sh95} improved this to\[\gg_r \frac{\log t}{\log\...
