  "overview": "How many A ⊆ {1,...,N} are there such that Σ_{n∈A} 1/n = 1? Is the count 2^{cN} for some c < 1, or does it grow like 2^{(1+o(1))N}?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "The count is 2^{(c+o(1))N} where c ≈ 0.91... (the Liu-Sawhney constant, defined via an integral equation). Three independent teams proved this within weeks of each other in 2024: Steinerberger (upper bound 2^{0.93N}), Liu-Sawhney (full asymptotic), and Conlon et al. (same asymptotic plus generalization to any rational target).",
