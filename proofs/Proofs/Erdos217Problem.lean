  For which $n$ are there $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, no three on a line and no four on a circle, which determine $n-1$ distinct distances and so that (in some ordering of the distances) the $i$th distance occurs $i$ times?
  
  
  
  An example with $n=4$ is an isosceles triangle with the point in the centre. Erd\H{o}s originally believed this was impossible for $n\geq 5$, but Pomerance constructed a ...
