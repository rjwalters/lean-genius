  Let $f_d(n)$ be minimal such that, in any set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, there exist at most $f_d(n)$ pairs of points which distance $1$ apart. Estimate $f_d(n)$.
  
  
  
  The most difficult cases are $d=2$ and $d=3$. When $d=2$ this is the unit distance problem [90], and the best known bounds are\[n^{1+\frac{c}{\log\log n}}< f_2(n) \ll n^{4/3}\]for some constant $c>0$, the lower bound by Erd\H...
