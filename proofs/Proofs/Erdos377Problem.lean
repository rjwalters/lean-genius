  Is there some absolute constant $C>0$ such that\[\sum_{p\leq n}1_{p\nmid \binom{2n}{n}}\frac{1}{p}\leq C\]for all $n$ (where the summation is restricted to primes $p\leq n$)?
  
  
  
  A question of Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus \cite{EGRS75}, who proved that if $f(n)$ is the sum in question then\[\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{1}{x}\sum_{n\leq x}f(n) = \sum_{k=2}^\infty \frac{\log k}{2^k}=\gamma_0\]a...
