  "overview": "For non-square n, let t_n be the minimal t such that {n+1,...,n+t} contains a subset S where n·∏S is a perfect square (t_n = 0 if n is square). The problem asks to estimate t_n. Selfridge proved that t_n = P(n) (largest prime divisor) when P(n) > √(2n)+1, and t_n ≪ √n otherwise. Bui-Pratt-Zaharescu (2024) showed the distribution of t_n follows P(n)'s distribution.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "The function t_n is completely characterized: it equals the largest prime divisor P(n) when P(n) is large (> √(2n)+1), and is bounded by O(√n) otherwise. For example, t_6 = 6 since 6·8·12 = 24². The behavior is determined by whether n is 'rough' (large prime factor) or 'smooth' (small prime factors).",
