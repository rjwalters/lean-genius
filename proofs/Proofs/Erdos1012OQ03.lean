# Erdős Problem #1012 — OQ-03:
# Directed Graph Hamiltonian Cycle Thresholds

## Background

The parent problem (Erdős #1012) asks about long cycles in dense UNDIRECTED
graphs. This open question investigates the directed analogue: what conditions
on a digraph guarantee the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle?

## Key Results (Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Theory)

1. **Ghouila-Houri (1960)**: A strongly connected digraph on n vertices where
   every vertex has in-degree and out-degree ≥ n/2 has a Hamiltonian cycle.

2. **Meyniel (1973)**: If for every pair of non-adjacent vertices u, v in a
   strongly connected digraph, d⁺(u) + d⁻(u) + d⁺(v) + d⁻(v) ≥ 2n - 1,
   then the digraph has a Hamiltonian cycle.

3. **Moon-Moser (1963)**: Every strongly connected tournament contains a
   Hamiltonian path. (Tournaments are complete digraphs: exactly one arc
   between each pair of vertices.)

4. **Woodall (directed, 1972)**: Directed analogue of the f(k) threshold.
   Dense digraphs with enough arcs contain long directed cycles.

## What This Proves

This file defines a simple digraph (directed graph without self-loops or
parallel arcs) and states the directed Hamiltonian cycle conditions.
All proofs are sorry — this is a survey and infrastructure session.

## Proof Roadmap

### Ghouila-Houri (~200 lines)
The proof follows the same structure as Dirac's theorem for undirected graphs:
1. Start with a longest directed path P in D
2. Show P must be Hamiltonian (otherwise, degree conditions force extension)
3. Close P into a cycle using the pigeonhole principle on in/out neighborhoods

### Moon-Moser (~150 lines)
1. Start with a Hamiltonian path (exists by Rédei's theorem)
2. Attempt to close into a cycle: try arc from last to first vertex
3. If not, use tournament property to find a "rotation" that closes the cycle

### Rédei (~100 lines)
Induction on n: remove one vertex, get a Hamiltonian path on n-1 vertices,
then insert the removed vertex into the path using tournament comparisons.
