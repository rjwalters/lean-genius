  Let $\hat{R}(G)$ denote the size Ramsey number, the minimal number of edges $m$ such that there is a graph $H$ with $m$ edges such that in any $2$-colouring of the edges of $H$ there is a monochromatic copy of $G$.
  
  Determine\[\hat{R}(K_{n,n}),\]where $K_{n,n}$ is the complete bipartite graph with $n$ vertices in each component.
  
  
  
  We know that\[\frac{1}{60}n^22^n<\hat{R}(K_{n,n})< \frac{3}...
