  Is there a $3$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices which contains at least $n-O(1)$ different sizes of cliques (maximal complete subgraphs)
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s constructed such a hypergraph with cliques of at least $n-\log_*n$ different sizes. For graphs, Spencer \cite{Sp71} constructed a graph which contains cliques of at least $n-\log_2n+O(1)$ different sizes, which Moon and Moser \cite{MoMo65} showe...
