  Let $\alpha>1$ be irrational. Are there infinitely many primes $p$ such that $\lfloor p\alpha\rfloor$ is also prime?
  
  
  
  Vinogradov \cite{Vi48} proved that the sequence $\{p\alpha\}$ is uniformly distributed for every irrational $\alpha$, and hence there are infinitely many primes $p$ of the shape $p=\lfloor n\alpha\rfloor$ for every irrational $\alpha>1$. Indeed, this occurs if and only if\[\fr...
