  Erdős Problem #16

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/16
  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Is the set of odd integers not of the form $2^k+p$ the union of an infinite arithmetic progression and a set of density $0$? Erdős called this conjecture 'rather silly'. Using covering congruences Erdős [Er50] proved that the set of such odd integers contains an infinite arithmetic progression. Chen [Ch23] has proved the answer is no. See also [9], [10], and [11].
