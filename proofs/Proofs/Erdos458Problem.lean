  Let $[1,\ldots,n]$ denote the least common multiple of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. Is it true that, for all $k\geq 1$,\[[1,\ldots,p_{k+1}-1]< p_k[1,\ldots,p_k]?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Graham write this is 'almost certainly' true, but the proof is beyond our ability, for (at least) two reasons:
  {UL}
  {LI}Firstly, one has to rule out the possibility of many primes $q$ such that $p_k<q^2<p_{k+1}$. There shou...
