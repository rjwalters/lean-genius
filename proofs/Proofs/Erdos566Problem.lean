# Erdős Problem #566 — Ramsey Size Linearity for Sparse Graphs

Let G be a graph such that every subgraph on k vertices has at most
2k − 3 edges. Is G Ramsey size linear? That is, for every graph H
with m edges and no isolated vertices, is r̂(G,H) ≤ c·m for some
constant c depending only on G?

Known:
- True for graphs with n vertices and ≤ n+1 edges (EFRS 1993)
- False for graphs with 2n−2 edges (e.g., H = Kₙ)
- Implies Problem #567

/- ## Main Question -/

/-- **Erdős Problem #566**: If G is (2k−3)-sparse, is G Ramsey
    size linear? That is, ∃ c > 0 such that r̂(G, H) ≤ c · |E(H)|
    for every H with no isolated vertices. -/
/- ## Known Results -/

/-- **EFRS (1993)**: Any graph G with n vertices and at most n+1
    edges is Ramsey size linear. -/
/-- **Counterexample at 2n−2**: The sparsity condition 2k−3 is
    tight — there exist graphs with 2n−2 edges that are NOT
    Ramsey size linear. -/
/- ## Related Results -/

/-- **Sparsity threshold**: The (2k−3) bound is the boundary
    between graphs that might be Ramsey size linear and those
    that provably are not. Trees (n−1 edges) are known to be
    Ramsey size linear. -/
/- **Implies Problem #567**: A positive answer to #566 would
    resolve #567 as well. -/
