  A positive odd integer $m$ such that none of $2^km+1$ are prime for $k\geq 0$ is called a Sierpinski number. We say that a set of primes $P$ is a covering set for $m$ if every $2^km+1$ is divisible by some $p\in P$.
  
  Are there Sierpinski numbers with no finite covering set of primes?
  
  
  
  Sierpinski \cite{Si60} proved that there are infinitely many Sierpinski numbers, using covering systems t...
