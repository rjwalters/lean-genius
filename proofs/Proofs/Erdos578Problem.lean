  If $G$ is a random graph on $2^d$ vertices, including each edge with probability $1/2$, then $G$ almost surely contains a copy of $Q_d$ (the $d$-dimensional hypercube with $2^d$ vertices and $d2^{d-1}$ many edges).
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Bollob\'{a}s. Solved by Riordan \cite{Ri00}, who in fact proved this with any edge-probability $>1/4$, and proves that the number of copies of $Q_d$ ...
