  Can $\mathbb{R}^n$ be decomposed into countably many sets, such that within each set all the pairwise distances are distinct?
  
  
  
  This is true (assuming the continuum hypothesis) when $n=1$, since Erd\H{o}s and Kakutani \cite{ErKa43} proved that in fact the continuum hypothesis is equivalent to the statemant that $\mathbb{R}$ can be written as the union of countably many sets, each of which is l...
