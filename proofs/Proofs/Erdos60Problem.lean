  Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $>\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)$ edges contain $\gg n^{1/2}$ many copies of $C_4$?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits, who could not even prove that at least $2$ copies of $C_4$ are guaranteed.
  
  The behaviour of $\mathrm{ex}(n;C_4)$ is the subject of [765].
  
  He, Ma, and Yang \cite{HeMaYa21} have proved this conjecture when $n=q^2+q+1$ for some even int...
