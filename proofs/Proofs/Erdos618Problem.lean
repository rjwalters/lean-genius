  For a triangle-free graph $G$ let $h_2(G)$ be the smallest number of edges that need to be added to $G$ so that it has diameter $2$ and is still triangle-free. Is it true that if $G$ has maximum degree $o(n^{1/2})$ then $h(G)=o(n^2)$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s, Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, and Ruszink\'{o} \cite{EGR98}. Simonovits showed that there exist graphs $G$ with maximum degree $\gg n^{1/2}$ and $h_...
