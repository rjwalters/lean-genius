  For any graph $H$ is there some $c=c(H)>0$ such that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices that does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph contains either a complete graph or independent set on $\geq n^c$ vertices?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal \cite{ErHa89}, who proved that a complete graph or independent set must exist on\[\geq \exp(c_H\sqrt{\log n})\]many vertices, where $c_H>0$ is some ...
