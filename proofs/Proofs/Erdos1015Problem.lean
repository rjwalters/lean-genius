  Let $f(t)$ be minimal such that, in any two-colouring of the edges of $K_n$, the edges can be partitioned into vertex disjoint monochromatic copies of $K_t$ (not necessarily the same colour) with at most $f(t)$ vertices remaining.
  
  Estimate $f(t)$. In particular, is it true that $f(t)^{1/t}\to 1$? Is it true that $f(t)\ll t$?
  
  
  
  A question of Moon \cite{Mo66b}, who proved that $f(3)=4$, at ...
