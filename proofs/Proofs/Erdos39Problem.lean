  Statement:
  Is there an infinite Sidon set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ such that\[\lvert A\cap \{1\ldots,N\}\rvert \gg_\epsilon N^{1/2-\epsilon}\]for all $\epsilon>0$? The trivial greedy construction achieves $\gg N^{1/3}$. The first improvement on this was achieved by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi [AKS81b], who found an infinite Sidon set with growth rate $\gg (N\log N)^{1/3}$. The current best bound of $\gg N^{\sqrt{2}-1+o(1)}$ is due to Ruzsa [Ru98]. Erdős [Er73] had offered \$25 for any construction which a...
