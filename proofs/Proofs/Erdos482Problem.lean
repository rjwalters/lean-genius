  Define a sequence by $a_1=1$ and\[a_{n+1}=\lfloor\sqrt{2}(a_n+1/2)\rfloor\]for $n\geq 1$. The difference $a_{2n+1}-2a_{2n-1}$ is the $n$th digit in the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$.
  
  Find similar results for $\theta=\sqrt{m}$, and other algebraic numbers.
  
  
  
  The result for $\sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Graham and Pollak \cite{GrPo70}. The problem statement is open-ended, but presumably Erd\H...
