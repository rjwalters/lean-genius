  Let $a_1<a_2<\cdots$ be a sequence of integers such that\[\limsup \frac{a_n}{n}=\infty.\]Is\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{a_n}}\]transcendental?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75c} proved the answer is yes under the stronger condition that $\limsup n_k/k^t=\infty$ for all $t\geq 1$.
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er88c} says 'many of these problems seem hopeless at present, but perhaps one can prove that if $a_n>...
