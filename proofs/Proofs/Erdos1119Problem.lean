  Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be an infinite cardinal with $\aleph_0<\mathfrak{m}<\mathfrak{c}=2^{\aleph_0}$. Let $\{f_\alpha\}$ be a family of entire functions such that, for every $z_0\in \mathbb{C}$, there are at most $\mathfrak{m}$ distinct values of $f_\alpha(z_0)$. Must $\{f_\alpha\}$ have cardinality at most $\mathfrak{m}$?
