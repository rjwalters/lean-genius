  "overview": "Let ε > 0 and n be sufficiently large. Is there a graph on n vertices with ≥ n²/8 edges which contains no K₄ such that the largest independent set has size at most εn? Equivalently: Is rt(n; 4, εn) ≥ n²/8?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - Fox-Loh-Zhao (2015) proved rt(n; 4, εn) ≥ n²/8 with independence number ≪ (log log n)^(3/2) / (log n)^(1/2) · n. The bound n²/8 corresponds to edge density 1/4, which equals the Ramsey-Turán density ρ₄.",
