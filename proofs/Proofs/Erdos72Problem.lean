  Is there a set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ of density $0$ and a constant $c>0$ such that every graph on sufficiently many vertices with average degree $\geq c$ contains a cycle whose length is in $A$?
  
  
  
  Bollob\'{a}s \cite{Bo77} proved that such a $c$ does exist if $A$ is an infinite arithmetic progression containing even numbers (see [71]).
  
  Erd\H{o}s was 'almost certain' that if $A$ is the set ...
