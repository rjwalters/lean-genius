  Does every set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ of positive density contain some finite $S\subset A$ such that $\sum_{n\in S}\frac{1}{n}=1$?
  
  
  
  The answer is yes, proved by Bloom \cite{Bl21}.
  
  See also [46] and [47].
  
  This problem has been formalised in Lean as part of the Google DeepMind Formal Conjectures project.
