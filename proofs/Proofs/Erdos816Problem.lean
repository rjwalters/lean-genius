  Let $G$ be a graph with $2n+1$ vertices and $n^2+n+1$ edges. Must $G$ contain two vertices of the same degree which are joined by a path of length $3$?
  
  
  
  A problem of Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. The example of $K_{n,n+1}$ shows that this fails if we only have $n^2+n$ edges.
  
  This is true, and was proved by Chen and Ma \cite{ChMa25}, who prove the stronger statement that, provided $n\geq 600$, al...
