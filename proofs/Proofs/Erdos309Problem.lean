  Let $N\geq 1$. How many integers can be written as the sum of distinct unit fractions with denominators from $\{1,\ldots,N\}$? Are there $o(\log N)$ such integers?
  
  
  
  If the number of such integers is $N(n)$ then it is trivial that $N(n)\leq \log n+O(1)$. Yokota \cite{Yo97} proved that $N(n)\geq \log n-O(\log\log n)$.
  
  Croot \cite{Cr99} proved that every integer at most\[\leq \sum_{n\leq N}...
