  Let $f(n)$ be the smallest number of colours required to colour the edges of $K_n$ such that every $K_4$ contains at least 5 colours. Determine the size of $f(n)$.
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s, who proved that\[\frac{5}{6}(n-1) < f(n)<n,\]and that $f(9)=8$. Erd\H{o}s believed the upper bound is closer to the truth. In fact the lower bound is: Bennett, Cushman, Dudek,and Pralat \cit...
