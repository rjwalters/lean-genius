  Let $A,B\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be infinite sets such that $A+B$ contains all large integers. Let $A(x)=\lvert A\cap [1,x]\rvert$ and similarly for $B(x)$. Is it true that if $A(x)B(x)\sim x$ then\[A(x)B(x)-x\to \infty\]as $x\to \infty$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Danzer. Such sets $A$ and $B$ (with all large integers in $A+B$ and $A(x)B(x)\sim x$) are called exact additive complements. Dan...
