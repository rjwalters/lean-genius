  Let $h(n)$ be such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $>n^2/4$ many edges contains a triangle whose vertices have degrees summing to at least $h(n)$. Estimate $h(n)$. In particular, is it true that\[h(n)\geq (2(\sqrt{3}-1)-o(1))n?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Laskar \cite{ErLa85} proved\[2(\sqrt{3}-1)n \geq h(n) \geq (1+c)n\]for some $c>0$. The lower bound was improved to $\frac{21}{16}n$ by Fan \cite...
