  Let $h(k)$ be Jacobsthal's function, defined to as the minimal $m$ such that, if $n$ has at most $k$ prime factors, then in any set of $m$ consecutive integers there exists an integer coprime to $n$. Determine the order of magnitude of $h(k)$. In particular, is it true that\[h(k) \ll k^2?\]
  
  
  
  That $h(k)\ll k^2$ is a conjecture of Jacobsthal. Iwaniec \cite{Iw78} proved\[h(k) \ll (k\log k)^2.\]T...
