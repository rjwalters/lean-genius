  Does every graph with infinite chromatic number contain a cycle of length $2^n$ for infinitely many $n$?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Mih\'{o}k and Erd\H{o}s. It is likely that $2^n$ can be replaced by any sufficiently quickly growing sequence (e.g. the squares).
  
  David Penman has observed that this is certainly true if the graph has uncountable chromatic number, since by a result of Erd\H{o}s and Haj...
