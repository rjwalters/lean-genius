  Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ be a set of density zero. Does there exist a $B$ such that $A\subseteq B+B$ and\[\lvert B\cap \{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert =o(N^{1/2})\]for all large $N$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Newman \cite{ErNe77} have proved this is true when $A$ is the set of squares. In fact, Theorem 2 of \cite{ErNe77} already implies a negative answer to this problem, but this seems to have been overlooked b...
