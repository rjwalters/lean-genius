  Let $r_3(N)$ be the size of the largest subset of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which does not contain a non-trivial $3$-term arithmetic progression. Prove that $r_3(N)\ll N/(\log N)^C$ for every $C>0$.
  
  
  
  Proved by Kelley and Meka \cite{KeMe23}. In \cite{ErGr80} and \cite{Er81} it is conjectured that this holds for every $k$-term arithmetic progression.
