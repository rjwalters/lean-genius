  Let $f_d(n)$ be the minimal $m$ such that any set of $m$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contains a set of $n$ points such that any two determined distances are distinct. Estimate $f_d(n)$. In particular, is it true that, for fixed $n\geq 3$,\[f_d(n)=2^{o(d)}?\]
  
  
  
  It is easy to prove that $f_d(n) \leq n^{O_d(1)}$. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er75f} claimed that he and Straus proved $f_d(n)\leq c_n^d$ for some co...
