  Let $F(n)$ be the maximal size of a family of subsets of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no set in this family is the union of other members of the family. Is it true that there is a constant $c>0$ such that\[F(n)\sim c \frac{2^n}{n^{1/2}}?\]
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman proved in unpublished work that\[F(n)\asymp \frac{2^n}{n^{1/2}}.\](\cite{Er71} has an exponent of $3/2$, but this is presumably a typ...
