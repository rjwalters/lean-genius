  Let $k\geq 2$. Does\[(n+k)!^2 \mid (2n)!\]for infinitely many $n$?
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Erd\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Straus \cite{EGRS75}. It is open even for $k=2$.
  
  Balakran \cite{Ba29} proved this holds for $k=1$ - that is, $(n+1)^2\mid \binom{2n}{n}$ for infinitely many $n$. It is a classical fact that $(n+1)\mid \binom{2n}{n}$ for all $n$ (see Catalan numbers).
