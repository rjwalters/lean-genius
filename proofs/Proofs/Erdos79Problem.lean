  We say $G$ is Ramsey size linear if $R(G,H)\ll m$ for all graphs $H$ with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices.
  
  Are there infinitely many graphs $G$ which are not Ramsey size linear but such that all of its subgraphs are?
  
  
  
  Asked by Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp \cite{EFRS93}. $K_4$ is the only known example of such a graph.
  
  Wigderson \cite{Wi24} has proved that there are in...
