  "overview": "Find the largest subset A ⊆ {1,...,N} containing N such that gcd(a,b) > 1 for all distinct a, b ∈ A. The original Erdős-Graham conjecture was wrong; Ahlswede-Khachatrian found a counterexample in 1992 and proved the correct characterization in 1996.",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "SOLVED - For N = q₁^k₁ ⋯ qᵣ^kᵣ, the maximum is achieved by integers that are multiples of elements from {2q₁,...,2qⱼ, q₁⋯qⱼ} for an optimal j. The original Erdős-Graham conjecture was disproved.",
