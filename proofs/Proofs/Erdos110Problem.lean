  Is there some $F(n)$ such that every graph with chromatic number $\aleph_1$ has, for all large $n$, a subgraph with chromatic number $n$ on at most $F(n)$ vertices?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s, Hajnal, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{EHS82}. This fails if the graph has chromatic number $\aleph_0$.
  
  A theorem of de Bruijn and Erd\H{os} \cite{dBEr51} implies that, if $G$ has infinite chromatic number...
