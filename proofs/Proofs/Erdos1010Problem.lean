  Let $t<\lfloor n/2\rfloor$. Does every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+t$ edges contain at least $t\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ triangles?
  
  
  
  Rademacher proved that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+1$ edges contains at least $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ triangles. Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er62d} proved that every graph on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+t$ edges contains at...
