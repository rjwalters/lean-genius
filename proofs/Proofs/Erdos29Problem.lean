  Erdős Problem #29

  Status: SOLVED
  Prize: $100

  Statement:
  Is there an explicit construction of a set $A\subseteq \mathbb{N}$ such that $A+A=\mathbb{N}$ but $1_A\ast 1_A(n)=o(n^\epsilon)$ for every $\epsilon>0$? The existence of such a set was asked by Sidon to Erdős in 1932. Erdős (eventually) proved the existence of such a set using probabilistic methods. This problem asks for a constructive solution. An explicit construction was given by Jain, Pham, Sawhney, and Zakharov [JPSZ24]. View the LaTeX source This page was last edited 28 December 2025.
