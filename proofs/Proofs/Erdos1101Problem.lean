  If $u=\{u_1<u_2<\cdots\}$ is a sequence of integers such that $(u_i,u_j)=1$ for all $i\neq j$ and $\sum \frac{1}{u_i}<\infty$ then let $\{a_1<a_2<\cdots\}$ be the sequence of integers which are not divisible by any of the $u_i$. For any $x$ define $t_x$ by\[u_1\cdots u_{t_x}\leq x< u_1\cdots u_{t_x}u_{t_x+1}.\]We call such a sequence $u_i$ good if, for all $\epsilon>0$, if $x$ is sufficiently large the...
