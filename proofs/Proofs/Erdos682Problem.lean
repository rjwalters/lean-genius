  Is it true that for almost all $n$ there exists some $m\in (p_n,p_{n+1})$ such that\[p(m) \geq p_{n+1}-p_n,\]where $p(m)$ denotes the least prime factor of $m$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s first thought this should be true for all large $n$, but found a (conditional) counterexample: Dickson's conjecture says there are infinitely many $d$ such that\[2183+30030d\textrm{ and }2201+30030d\]are both prime, and the...
