  Let $k\geq 3$ and define $F_k(n)$ to be the minimal $r$ such that there is a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor+1$ many edges such that the edges can be $r$-coloured so that every subgraph isomorphic to $C_{2k+1}$ has no colour repeating on the edges.
  
  Is it true that\[F_k(n)\sim n^2/8?\]
  
  
  
  A problem of Burr, Erd\H{o}s, Graham, and S\'{o}s, who proved that\[F_k(n)\gg n^2....
