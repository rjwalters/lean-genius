  Let $G$ be an $r$-partite graph with $n$ vertices in each part. If $G$ has minimum degree $\geq (r-\frac{3}{2}-o(1))n$ then $G$ must contain a $K_r$.
  
  
  
  A conjecture of Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di \cite{BES75b}, who proved that $r-\frac{3}{2}$ would be the best possible here.
  
  This is true, and was proved by Haxell \cite{Ha01}. The sharp threshold of\[(r-1)n-\left\lceil \frac...
