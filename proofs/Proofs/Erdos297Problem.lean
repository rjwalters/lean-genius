  Let $N\geq 1$. How many $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ are there such that $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}=1$?
  
  
  
  It was not even known for a long time whether this is $2^{cN}$ for some $c<1$ or $2^{(1+o(1))N}$. In fact the former is true, and the correct value of $c$ is now known.

  {LI}Steinerberger \cite{St24} proved the relevant count is at most $2^{0.93N}$;{/LI}
