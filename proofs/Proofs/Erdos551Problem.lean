  Status: SOLVED
  

  Statement:
  Prove that\[R(C_k,K_n)=(k-1)(n-1)+1\]for $k\geq n\geq 3$ (except when $n=k=3$). Asked by Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp, who also ask for the smallest value of $k$ such that this identity holds (for fixed $n$). They also ask, for fixed $n$, what is the minimum value of $R(C_k,K_n)$? This identity was proved for $k>n^2-2$ by Bondy and Erdős [BoEr73]. Nikiforov [Ni05] extended this to $k\geq 4n+2$. Keevash, Long, and Skokan [KLS21] have proved this identity when $k\geq C\frac{\log n}{\log...
