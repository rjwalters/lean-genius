  Let $\epsilon>0$. Is there some set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ of density $>1-\epsilon$ such that $a_1\cdots a_r=b_1\cdots b_s$ with $a_i,b_j\in A$ can only hold when $r=s$?
  
  Similarly, can one always find a set $A\subset\{1,\ldots,N\}$ with this property of size $\geq (1-o(1))N$?
  
  
  
  An example of such a set with density $1/4$ is given by the integers $\equiv 2\pmod{4}$.
