  How large can $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ be if $A+A$ contains no square numbers?
  
  
  
  Taking all integers $\equiv 1\pmod{3}$ shows that $\lvert A\rvert\geq N/3$ is possible. This can be improved to $\tfrac{11}{32}N$ by taking all integers $\equiv 1,5,9,13,14,17,21,25,26,29,30\pmod{32}$, as observed by Massias.
  
  Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer \cite{LOS83} proved this is sharp for the modular ...
