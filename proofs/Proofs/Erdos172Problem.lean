  Is it true that in any finite colouring of $\mathbb{N}$ there exist arbitrarily large finite $A$ such that all sums and products of distinct elements in $A$ are the same colour?
  
  
  
  First asked by Hindman. Hindman \cite{Hi80} has proved this is false (with 7 colours) if we ask for an infinite $A$. In \cite{Er77c} Erd\H{o}s asks about the case for an infinite $A$ with just $2$ colours.
