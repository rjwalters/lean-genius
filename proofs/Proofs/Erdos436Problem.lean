  If $p$ is a prime and $k,m\geq 2$ then let $r(k,m,p)$ be the minimal $r$ such that $r,r+1,\ldots,r+m-1$ are all $k$th power residues modulo $p$. Let\[\Lambda(k,m)=\limsup_{p\to \infty} r(k,m,p).\]Is it true that $\Lambda(k,2)$ is finite for all $k$? Is $\Lambda(k,3)$ finite for all odd $k$? How large are they?
  
  
  
  Asked by Lehmer and Lehmer \cite{LeLe62}, who note that for example $\Lambda(2,2)=...
