  For every $r\geq 4$ and $k\geq 2$ is there some finite $f(k,r)$ such that every graph of chromatic number $\geq f(k,r)$ contains a subgraph of girth $\geq r$ and chromatic number $\geq k$?
  
  
  
  Conjectured by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal. R\"{o}dl \cite{Ro77} has proved the $r=4$ case (see [923]). The infinite version (whether every graph of infinite chromatic number contains a subgraph of infinite chrom...
