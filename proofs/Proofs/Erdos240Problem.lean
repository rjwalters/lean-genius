  Is there an infinite set of primes $P$ such that if $\{a_1<a_2<\cdots\}$ is the set of integers divisible only by primes in $P$ then $\lim a_{i+1}-a_i=\infty$?
  
  
  
  Originally asked to Erd\H{o}s by Wintner.
  
  The limit is infinite for a finite set of primes, which follows from a theorem of P\'{o}lya \cite{Po18}, that if $f(n)$ is a quadratic integer polynomial without repeated roots then as $n...
