  Let $k\geq 1$ and $\sigma_k(n)=\sum_{d\mid n}d^k$. Is\[\sum \frac{\sigma_k(n)}{n!}\]irrational?
  
  
  
  This is known now for $1\leq k\leq 4$. The cases $k=1,2$ are reasonably straightforward, as observed by Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er52}. The case $k=3$ was proved independently by Schlage-Puchta \cite{ScPu06} and Friedlander, Luca, and Stoiciu \cite{FLC07}. The case $k=4$ was proved by Pratt \cite{Pr22}.
