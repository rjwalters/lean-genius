  Let $m,n\geq 1$. What is\[\# \{ k(m-k) : 1\leq k\leq m/2\} \cap \{ l(n-l) : 1\leq l\leq n/2\}?\]Can it be arbitrarily large? Is it $\leq (mn)^{o(1)}$ for all sufficiently large $m,n$?
  
  
  
  This was solved independently by Hegyv\'{a}ri \cite{He25} and Cambie (unpublished), who show that if $m>n$ then the set in question has size\[\leq m^{O(1/\log\log m)},\]and that for any integer $s$ there exist ...
