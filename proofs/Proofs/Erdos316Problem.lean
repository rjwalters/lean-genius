  Is it true that if $A\subset \mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$ is a finite set with $\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}<2$ then there is a partition $A=A_1\sqcup A_2$ such that\[\sum_{n\in A_i}\frac{1}{n}<1\]for $i=1,2$?
  
  
  
  This is not true if $A$ is a multiset, for example $2,3,3,5,5,5,5$.
  
  This is not true in general, as shown by S\'{a}ndor \cite{Sa97}, who observed that the proper divisors of $120$ form ...
