Shapley-Folkman Lemma

The Shapley–Folkman lemma bounds the non-convexity of a Minkowski sum:
every point in the convex hull of a sum of N sets in d-dimensional space
can be decomposed so that at most d summands come from convex hulls
rather than the original sets. This is a fundamental result in convex
analysis with deep applications in mathematical economics.

The proof follows the same Carathéodory reduction strategy used in
Mathlib's proof of Carathéodory's theorem: find an affinely dependent
representation and reduce it, counting the dimension bound.

Part 1: Convex Hull Decomposition for Minkowski Sums

Key identity: conv(A + B) = conv(A) + conv(B)
This extends to finite sums: conv(∑ Sᵢ) = ∑ conv(Sᵢ)

A point in ∑ conv(Sᵢ) decomposes as x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ).
By Carathéodory, each xᵢ is a convex combination of ≤ d+1 points from Sᵢ.
The Shapley-Folkman bound says at most d of these need > 1 point.

Part 2: The Shapley-Folkman Lemma (Main Statement)

For finite families of sets in ℝᵈ, any point in the Minkowski sum of
convex hulls can be written as a sum where at most d summands require
convexification. The remaining n - d summands come from the original sets.

    such that xᵢ ∈ Sᵢ for all but at most d = finrank(ℝ, E) indices. -/

Part 3: Key Lemma — Reduction Step

The proof strategy: among all decompositions x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ),
choose one that minimizes the total number of vertices used in Carathéodory
representations across all summands.

If more than d indices have xᵢ ∉ Sᵢ (i.e., xᵢ needs ≥ 2 vertices), then
the "excess" vertices (beyond one per index) number at least d + 1, giving
an affine dependence. This dependence lets us shift weights to reduce the
total vertex count — contradicting minimality.
-/

/-- If a point is in the convex hull of S but not in S itself, it requires
    at least 2 points from S in any Carathéodory representation.

    Proof strategy: Use Mathlib's `eq_pos_convex_span_of_mem_convexHull` (from
    Caratheodory.lean) which gives an affinely independent representation with
    strictly positive weights. If the representation has 0 points, ∑ w = 0 ≠ 1.
    If it has 1 point, x = z₀ ∈ s, contradicting x ∉ s. So it has ≥ 2 points.

Part 4: Decomposition of Main Proof

The main proof of shapley_folkman proceeds by:
1. Among all decompositions x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ), choose one minimizing
   the total number of Carathéodory vertices across all summands.
2. If > d indices have xᵢ ∉ Sᵢ, collect one "excess" vertex from each.
3. These > d points are affinely dependent (by excess_vertices_affine_dependent).
4. Use the dependence to shift weights, reducing the vertex count — contradiction.
-/

/-- A decomposition is vertex-minimal if no other decomposition uses fewer
    total Carathéodory vertices. The existence of such a decomposition follows
    from the well-ordering of ℕ; the vertex count is finite because each summand
    uses finitely many vertices by Carathéodory's theorem. -/
