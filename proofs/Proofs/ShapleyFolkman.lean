Shapley-Folkman Lemma

The Shapley–Folkman lemma bounds the non-convexity of a Minkowski sum:
every point in the convex hull of a sum of N sets in d-dimensional space
can be decomposed so that at most d summands come from convex hulls
rather than the original sets. This is a fundamental result in convex
analysis with deep applications in mathematical economics.

The proof follows the same Carathéodory reduction strategy used in
Mathlib's proof of Carathéodory's theorem: find an affinely dependent
representation and reduce it, counting the dimension bound.

Part 1: Convex Hull Decomposition for Minkowski Sums

Key identity: conv(A + B) = conv(A) + conv(B)
This extends to finite sums: conv(∑ Sᵢ) = ∑ conv(Sᵢ)

A point in ∑ conv(Sᵢ) decomposes as x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ).
By Carathéodory, each xᵢ is a convex combination of ≤ d+1 points from Sᵢ.
The Shapley-Folkman bound says at most d of these need > 1 point.

Part 2: The Shapley-Folkman Lemma (Main Statement)

For finite families of sets in ℝᵈ, any point in the Minkowski sum of
convex hulls can be written as a sum where at most d summands require
convexification. The remaining n - d summands come from the original sets.
-/

/-
Part 3: Key Lemma — Reduction Step

The proof strategy: among all decompositions x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ),
choose one that minimizes the total number of vertices used in Carathéodory
representations across all summands.

If more than d indices have xᵢ ∉ Sᵢ (i.e., xᵢ needs ≥ 2 vertices), then
the "excess" vertices (beyond one per index) number at least d + 1, giving
an affine dependence. This dependence lets us shift weights to reduce the
total vertex count — contradicting minimality.
-/

/-- If a point is in the convex hull of S but not in S itself, it requires
    at least 2 points from S in any Carathéodory representation.

    Proof strategy: Use Mathlib's `eq_pos_convex_span_of_mem_convexHull` (from
    Caratheodory.lean) which gives an affinely independent representation with
    strictly positive weights. If the representation has 0 points, ∑ w = 0 ≠ 1.
    If it has 1 point, x = z₀ ∈ s, contradicting x ∉ s. So it has ≥ 2 points.

    Key Mathlib theorem:
    `eq_pos_convex_span_of_mem_convexHull : x ∈ convexHull 𝕜 s →
      ∃ (ι : Sort _) (_ : Fintype ι) (z : ι → E) (w : ι → 𝕜),
        range z ⊆ s ∧ AffineIndependent 𝕜 z ∧ (∀ i, 0 < w i) ∧
        ∑ i, w i = 1 ∧ ∑ i, w i • z i = x`

    Note: weights are strictly positive (0 < w i), not just non-negative.
    This is inherited from eq_pos_convex_span and is needed for the
    perturbation argument in reduce_excess_by_one. -/

Part 4: Proof Architecture for the Main Theorem

The proof of shapley_folkman uses a reduction argument:
1. Start with any decomposition x = ∑ xᵢ with xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ)
2. If > d indices have xᵢ ∉ Sᵢ, reduce the excess count by 1
3. Iterate until ≤ d excess indices remain

The reduction step (reduce_excess_by_one) works as follows:
  a. For each excess index i, xᵢ ∈ conv(Sᵢ) \ Sᵢ, so by convexHull_not_mem_requires_two,
     xᵢ has a binary representation xᵢ = tᵢ·aᵢ + (1-tᵢ)·bᵢ with aᵢ,bᵢ ∈ Sᵢ, 0 < tᵢ < 1
  b. Define δᵢ = bᵢ - aᵢ for each excess index
  c. Since there are d+1 excess indices and dim E = d, the δᵢ are linearly dependent:
     ∃ cᵢ not all zero with ∑ cᵢ·δᵢ = 0
  d. Perturb: xᵢ' = xᵢ + ε·cᵢ·δᵢ for a scalar ε chosen so that one index
     hits a boundary (xᵢ' = aᵢ or bᵢ ∈ Sᵢ)
  e. Since ∑ cᵢ·δᵢ = 0, the perturbation preserves ∑ xᵢ = x
  f. The result has one fewer excess index
-/

/-- **Linear dependence extraction**: d+1 vectors in d-dimensional space are
    linearly dependent, and we can extract explicit coefficients.
    This is the key algebraic input for the perturbation argument. -/

/-- **Reduction step**: If a decomposition has more than d excess indices
    (where d = Module.finrank ℝ E), there exists another decomposition of
    the same point with strictly fewer excess indices.

    This is the core of the Shapley-Folkman proof. The argument uses:
    - Binary representations from convexHull_not_mem_requires_two
    - Linear dependence of d+1 direction vectors in d-dimensional space
    - A perturbation that collapses one excess index to an original point

    Proof sketch:
    1. Pick d+1 excess indices i₁,...,i_{d+1}
    2. For each iₘ: point(iₘ) = tₘ·aₘ + (1-tₘ)·bₘ, aₘ bₘ ∈ S(iₘ), 0 < tₘ < 1
    3. Let δₘ = bₘ - aₘ. By Fintype.linearIndependent_iff + dim bound:
       ∃ c : Fin(d+1) → ℝ, ∑ cₘ·δₘ = 0, ∃ m, cₘ ≠ 0
    4. Set ε = argmin over m of |boundary_distance(m)/cₘ| (only m with cₘ ≠ 0)
    5. New point: point'(iₘ) = point(iₘ) + ε·cₘ·δₘ = aₘ + (1-tₘ+ε·cₘ)·δₘ
    6. For the minimizing m: point'(iₘ) = aₘ ∈ S(iₘ) or bₘ ∈ S(iₘ)
    7. ∑ point'(i) = ∑ point(i) + ε·∑ cₘ·δₘ = x + 0 = x  ✓
    8. All point'(i) ∈ conv(S i) since they're still convex combinations  ✓ -/
