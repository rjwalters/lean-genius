  Let $C>0$ be a constant. Are there infinitely many integers $a,b,n$ with $a+b> n+C\log n$ such that the denominator of\[\frac{n!}{a!b!}\]contains only primes $\ll_C 1$?
  
  
  
  Erd\H{o}s \cite{Er68c} proved that if $a!b!\mid n!$ then $a+b\leq n+O(\log n)$. The proof is easy, and can be done with powers of $2$ alone: Legendre's formula implies that if $2^k$ is the highest power of $2$ dividing $n!$ t...
