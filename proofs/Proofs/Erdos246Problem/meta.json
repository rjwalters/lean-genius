  "overview": "Let (a, b) = 1. Is the set {a^k b^l : k, l ≥ 0} complete—that is, is every sufficiently large integer the sum of distinct integers of this form?",
  "sections": [],
  "conclusion": "YES - Birch (1959) proved completeness. Cassels (1960) gave a more general result. Davenport showed it holds with bounded l. Quantitative bounds: Hegyvári (2000) quadruple exponential, Fang-Chen (2017) triply exponential. Yu (2024) showed large n can use summands > n/(log n)^{1+o(1)}.",
