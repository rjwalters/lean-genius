  Let $P(z)=\sum_{1\leq k\leq n}a_kz^k$ for some $a_k\in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert a_k\rvert=1$ for $1\leq k\leq n$. Does there exist a constant $c>0$ such that, for $n\geq 2$, we have\[\max_{\lvert z\rvert=1}\lvert P(z)\rvert \geq (1+c)\sqrt{n}?\]
  
  
  
  This is Problem 4.31 in \cite{Ha74}, in which it is described as a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Newman.
  
  The lower bound of $\sqrt{n}$ is trivial...
