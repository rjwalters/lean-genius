  Is there a set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that, for all large $N$,\[\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \ll N/\log N\]and such that every large integer can be written as $2^k+a$ for some $k\geq 0$ and $a\in A$?
  
  
  
  Lorentz \cite{Lo54} proved there is such a set with, for all large $N$,\[\lvert A\cap\{1,\ldots,N\}\rvert \ll \frac{\log\log N}{\log N}N\]The answer is yes, proved by Ruzsa \cite{Ru72}. R...
