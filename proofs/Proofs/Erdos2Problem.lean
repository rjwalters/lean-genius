  Erdős Problem #2

  Source: https://erdosproblems.com/2
  Status: SOLVED
  Prize: $1000

  Statement:
  Can the smallest modulus of a covering system be arbitrarily large? Described by Erdős as 'perhaps my favourite problem'. Hough [Ho15], building on work of Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance, and Yu [FFKPY07], has shown (contrary to Erdős' expectations) that the answer is no: the smallest modulus must be at most $10^{16}$. An alternative, simpler, proof was given by Balister, Bollobás, Morris, Sahasrabudhe, and Tiba [BBMST22], who improved the upper bound on the smallest modulus to $616000$....
