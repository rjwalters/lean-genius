# Batch 2/3/4/5 + Doctor verification state (updated Doctor batch #38065, 2026-07-12)

## DOCTOR BATCH NUMBERS (#38065, first increment)

Ledger `verify-results.tsv` now covers the **full 2,659-file inventory-FAIL
baseline** (verified: `comm -23 <(inventory FAILs) <(ledger rows)` = 0):

- **484 GREEN / 2,151 RESIDUAL / 24 PRE-EXISTING** (session start: 973 tracked,
  294 GREEN / 655 RESIDUAL).
- Wave 0 (required first acceptance criterion, COMPLETE): zero-edit re-verify of
  the 1,687 untracked inventory FAILs in 8 shards
  (`targets-W0smoke/aa..ah`, results/diag files on branch) using
  `runner3.sh` — like runner2 but keeps 2 context lines per error so
  instance-synth diags record WHICH instance failed.
- Doctor fix waves: DR1 (64 targets, 17 green), DR2 (282 targets, 43 green),
  DR5 (250 targets incl. 40-row regression sample, 82 green).
  (Doctor waves are `DR*` — plain `D1/D2` are the Mechanic's earlier artifacts.)
- Regression gate: 40 previously-GREEN modules re-verified in DR5 — **40/40
  still PASS**, no regression from any repo-wide edit.
- Zero `unclassified`/`doctor-unclassified` rows: classifier extended
  (signature-drift, elab-drift, duplicate-decl, oom-killed, slow-timeout,
  instance-synth-stuck, …) + `reclassify.py` recomputes classes from the
  freshest diag per module.

## Residual classes after Doctor increment 1 (2,151 total) + dispositions

| class | count | disposition |
|---|---|---|
| type-mismatch | 572 | per-file signature bridges; next Doctor session — start from diag-W0*/diag-DR5 (fresh, context-aware) |
| unknown-const singletons | 500 | wave-0 unmasked ~350 new names; harvest with the §batch-5 procedure; import-loss subset → umbrella `import Mathlib` |
| proof-drift | 407 | per-file tactic repair (linarith/omega/simp drift); hub-first (see hub table in map §7) |
| instance-synth | 328 | classical recipe (§7a) applied to 141 pattern rows; remainder = cyclotomic-instance mystery (see below) + stuck-instance shapes |
| rewrite-drift | 99 | per-file `rw` pattern updates |
| signature-drift | 74 | Function-expected / application-type-mismatch; many are `Std.Symm`-adjacent (recipe §7c) |
| parse-error | 70 | remaining hand-inspect (mostly wave-0 new) |
| elab-drift | 32 | universe/metavariable/anonymous-constructor drift; per-file |
| dot-notation-drift | 30 | recipes in map §7d (max?, flatMap, primeFactorsList, …) |
| decide-maxrecdepth | 9 | `set_option maxRecDepth 40000` recipe validated (TwinPrimes/SophieGermain green) |
| duplicate-decl | 8 | project-local double declarations (never-compiled tier, route with PRE-EXISTING follow-up) |
| noncomputable | 7 | `fix_noncomputable.py` on next wave's diag |
| slow-timeout | 6 | need >300s per-target or 600s retry (incl. HurwitzTheoremOQ04) |
| partenat-removal | 4 | ℕ∞/emultiplicity rework (ChebyshevPNTBridgeOQ01 + 3) — deep-rework |
| lambda-reserved-token | 2 | rename λ binders (recipe §7e) |
| uses-sorry / termination-drift / oom-killed | 3 | per-file |

**Known deep-rework items** (dispositions, not bugs in this batch):
- `IsCyclotomicExtension {n} ℚ (CyclotomicField n ℚ)` fails to synthesize in
  InverseGalois/AngleTrisectionEmbedding although v4.31 has the `[CharZero K]`
  instance (Cyclotomic/Basic.lean:702) — needs in-container debugging.
- `Set.ncard_biUnion` → `Set.Finite.ncard_biUnion` with finsum RHS
  (BallotProblemOQ01OQ02OQ01 family) — proof rework, not a rename.
- AbelRuffiniOQ10 / Erdos968: `native_decide` × noncomputable catch-22 (map §6.5).
- 24 PRE-EXISTING never-compiled rows: route to a separate cleanup issue.

## Doctor recipes catalog

See `research/toolchain-v4.31-rename-map.md` **section 7** for the full
verified recipe catalog added by this batch (classical decidability loss,
Subgroup.normalizer Set-argument, Std.Symm/Std.Irrefl SimpleGraph fields,
NormedSpace.exp, Complex.abs shims, notation-scope losses, parse repairs, …)
and `batch2/add_open_classical.py` / `batch2/fix_noncomputable.py` /
`batch2/reclassify.py` for the sweep tooling.

## Backlog → next Doctor session

1. Re-diagnose + fix hub files first: each hub flip cascades (this session:
   CayleyHamiltonOQ02OQ01 '-/'-docstring fix flipped 5, AmgmInequalityOQ02
   flipped 7, AreaOfCircleOQ01OQ02OQ02 flipped 12, Step4 flipped 3).
2. unknown-const harvest over diag-W0* (500 rows, many mechanical).
3. type-mismatch bridges (572) — largest class.
4. Remaining classical-recipe candidates among the 328 instance-synth rows.

Merge: `cd proofs/batch2 && python3 merge_results.py --results results-X.txt --diag diag-X.txt`
(idempotent). Reclassify: `python3 reclassify.py`.
≤2 containers concurrently. NEVER lake build on the host.
All edits are applied ONLY to files already FAIL in proofs/spike-logs-full/results-full.tsv,
so no previously-passing file can have regressed (regression sample re-checked
40 GREEN rows in DR5: 40/40 PASS).
